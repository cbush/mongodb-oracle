[Validation Rules](#validation-rules)\n* [Validation Actions and Levels](#validation-actions-and-levels)\n* [Limitations](#limitations) ## Validation Tab The Validation tab allows you to manage[schema validation rules](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/document-validation/)for a collection. Schema validation ensures that all documents in a collection follow a defined set of rules, such as conforming to a specific shape or only allowing a specified range of values in fields. ![Validation view](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/validation-view.png) ## Validation Rules _Updated in version 1.18._ The validation editor supports [JSON Schema validation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/schema-validation/#json-schema), and validation with query expressions using [query operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/). As you edit your validation,Compass updates in real-time to display a document from your collection that passes the validation and a document that fails. ### JSON Schema Validation To specify JSON Schema validation, use the[$jsonSchema](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/jsonSchema/)operator. `| {                                                         |\n| --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| $jsonSchema: {                                            |\n| required: ['customer'], // the customer field is required |\n| properties: {                                             |\n| purchaseMethod: {                                         |\n| enum: ['In Store','Online'],                              |\n| description: \"can only be either 'In Store' or 'Online'\"  |\n| }                                                         |\n| }                                                         |\n| }                                                         |\n| }                                                         | ` The [$jsonSchema](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/jsonSchema/)operator supports various keywords to specify validation rules. For example: * The `required` array defines required fields in your document.\n* The `properties` object defines rules for specific document  \nfields.

Operators You can also specify validation using[query operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/), with the exception of the following query operators: [$near](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/near/#mongodb-query-op.-near),[$nearSphere](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/nearSphere/#mongodb-query-op.-nearSphere), [$text](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/text/#mongodb-query-op.-text), and [$where.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/where/#mongodb-query-op.-where) ``` {    $or: [       { phone: { $type: \"string\" } },       { email: { $regex:

## Validation Actions and Levels At the top, specify a Validation Action andValidation Level: * The validation action determines whether to `warn` but accept invalid documents, or `error` and reject invalid documents.\n* The validation level determines how strictly MongoDB applies validation rules to existing documents.  \n   * `Strict` validation applies your rules to all document inserts and updates.  \n   * `Moderate` validation only applies your rules to new documents and existing valid documents. Existing invalid documents are not affected. For details on validation actions and levels, see[Specify Validation Rules](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/schema-validation/#specify-validation-rules) in the MongoDB manual. ## Tip ### See also:  * [Schema Validation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/schema-validation/) ## Limitations The Validation tab is not available if you are connected to a [Data Lake.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/data-lake/) In MongoDB Compass Readonly Edition, you can only view validation rules.

Installation](#mongodb-server-installation)\n* [Resources and Documentation](#resources-and-documentation)\n* [MongoDB Community Forums](#mongodb-community-forums) The following sections outline methods to learn MongoDB basics and best practices. ## Free MongoDB Courses Online To help you get started with MongoDB Compass and the MongoDB database, see the MongoDB University course [M001](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M001/about). This course provides access to a student cluster for learning about MongoDB. If you are looking to learn more about MongoDB technologies, there are other available courses to help you along the way. All courses are available at no charge. In the course catalog, you will find courses on: * Development in [Java](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M220J/about), [Node.js](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M220JS/about), [Python,](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M220P/about)\n* [New features and tools available](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M042/about) in the latest version of MongoDB,\n* [Cluster administration,](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M103/about)\n* [Aggregation,](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M121/about)\n* [Performance](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M201/about), and more. ## Free MongoDB Cluster for Learning and Testing If you would like to use a hosted instance of MongoDB rather than set up a local server, you can set up a free `M0` cluster on [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), MongoDB's hosted database as a service. The `M0` tier cluster is ideal for learning and testing. Once the cluster is set up, you can use the Connect button in the Atlas interface to obtain the correct Compass connection settings for your cluster. Fill in the Compass connection form with your settings to [connect to your cluster.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/#std-label-connect-run-compass) ## MongoDB Server Installation To

Shell](#open-the-embedded-mongodb-shell)\n* [Use the Embedded MongoDB Shell](#use-the-embedded-mongodb-shell)\n* [Disable the Embedded MongoDB Shell](#disable-the-embedded-mongodb-shell) Starting in version 1.22, MongoDB Compass contains an embedded shell,[mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh). [mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh) is a JavaScript environment for interacting with MongoDB deployments. You can use [mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh)to test queries and operations in your database. ## Open the Embedded MongoDB Shell To open the embedded [mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh), click \\_MONGOSHat the bottom of the MongoDB Compass window. ## Use the Embedded MongoDB Shell By default, [mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh), connects to the `test` database. To use a different database, run the following command in[mongosh:](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh) `| use <database name> |\n| ------------------- | ` To run an operation in the embedded MongoDB Shell, type the operation into the shell and press Enter. The following example runs a [db.collection.find()](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/#mongodb-method-db.collection.find) operation: ## Example ```shell db.employees.find( { \"last_name\": \"Smith\" } ) \n``` ### Multi-Line Operations in the Embedded MongoDB Shell To write an operation that spans multiple lines in the embedded[mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh), begin with the first line, then pressShift + Enter to move to the next line of code. When you are finished writing your operation, press Enterto run it.

Index](#create-an-index)\n* [Drop an Index](#drop-an-index)\n* [Limitations](#limitations) Indexes are special data structures that improve query performance. Indexes store a portion of a collection's data in an easy-to-traverse form. The index stores the value of a specific field or set of fields, ordered by the value of the field. To improve query performance, build indexes on fields that appear often in queries and for all operations that[sort by a field.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/query/sort/#std-label-query-bar-sort) * Queries on an indexed field can use the index to limit the number of documents that must be scanned to find matching documents.\n* Sort operations on an indexed field can return documents pre-sorted by the index. To learn more about indexes, see [Indexes.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/) ## Note ### Considerations Indexes have some negative performance impact on write operations. For collections with high write-to-read ratio, indexes are expensive since each insert must also update any indexes. For a detailed list of considerations for indexes, see[Operational Considerations for Indexes.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/data-model-operations/#std-label-data-model-indexes) ## Indexes Tab The Indexes tab lists the existing indexes for a collection. To access the Indexes tab for a collection, click on the collection on the left hand pane and select the Indexes tab. ![Indexes view](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/indexes-view.png) For each index, Compass displays the following information: | Name and Definition | The name of the index and keys.                                                                          |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Type                | Regular, text, geospatial or hashed index.                                                               |\n| Size                | How large the index is.                                                                                  |\n| Usage               | Number of times the index has been used since the time the index was created or the last server restart. |\n| Properties          | Any special properties (such as uniqueness, partial) of the index.                                       | ## Create an Index To create an index on a collection via Compass, the collection must contain documents. 1 ### Click the Create Index button. From the [Indexes](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/collections/#std-label-collection-tab) tab, click theCreate Index button to bring up theCreate Index dialog. 2 ### Optional. Enter the index name.

5 ### Click Create Index. ### Wildcard Indexes _New in version v4.2_. You can create [wildcard indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-wildcard/) to support queries against unknown or arbitrary fields. To create a wildcard index in Compass, manually type the wildcard index field (`<field>.$**`) into the Select a field nameinput. ## Example Consider a collection where documents contain a `userMetadata`object. The fields within the `userMetadata` object may vary between documents. You can create a wildcard index on `userMetadata` to account for all potential fields within the object. Type the following into the Select a field name input: ```javascript userMetadata.$** \n``` Specify a type (`ascending` or `descending`) for your wildcard index, then click Create Index. Compass shows the type of your new index asWildcard. ## Drop an Index 1 ### Click the trash can icon for the index to drop. From the [Indexes](#std-label-indexes-tab) tab, to delete an index, click on the trash can icon for that index. A confirmation dialog appears. 2 ### Confirm the index to delete. In the dialog, enter the name of the index to delete. 3 ### Click Drop to drop the index. ## Limitations * Creating and dropping indexes is not permitted in MongoDB Compass Readonly Edition.\n* The

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) # Connect to MongoDB On this page * [Considerations](#considerations)\n* [Connect](#connect)\n* [Connecting with Compass from the Command Line](#connecting-with-compass-from-the-command-line)\n* [Advanced Connection Options](#advanced-connection-options) This page outlines how to use MongoDB Compass to connect to a MongoDB host. You can connect to a standalone, replica set, or sharded cluster host. ## Note ### MongoDB Atlas If you need to create a MongoDB host, consider using[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs%5Fcompass). Atlas is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service which requires no installation, offers a free tier to get started, and provides a copyable URI to easily connect Compass to your deployment. If you need to install Compass, see[Download and Install Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/install/#std-label-download-install) for instructions. ## Considerations * When connecting Compass to a replica set, it is not recommended to connect directly to an individual replica set member. If the member to which you are connected switches from a[primary](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/replica-set-primary/) member to a[secondary](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/replica-set-secondary/) or vice versa as the result of an election, Compass may either forcibly close the connection or display stale data.  \nInstead, to connect to a replica set, use either the replica setSRV record or Replica Set Name when filling in your connection information.\n* Starting in MongoDB Compass 1.19, Compass displays a warning message when connected to non-genuine MongoDB instances as these instances may behave differently from the official MongoDB instances; e.g. missing or incomplete features, different feature behaviors, etc. ## Connect When you open Compass, an initial connection dialog appears: ![New connection dialog for pasting your connection string](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/new-connection.png) You can connect your deployments by either: * Providing your connection string.\n* Specifying Advanced Connection Options. Advanced connection options allow you to specify authentication, TLS/SSL, and SSH connection options. To learn more, see[Advanced Connection Options.](#std-label-advanced-connection-options) ### Paste Connection String When you provide a connection string, Compass supports most [Connection String Options](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options)supported by MongoDB. By default, Compass's default[socketTimeoutMS](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#urioption.socketTimeoutMS)value is 60000, or 60 seconds. If you are frequently experiencing timeouts in Compass, consider setting this option to a higher value in your connection string. For a complete list of the connection string options thatCompass supports, see the[Compass Connection README](https://github.com/mongodb-js/connection-model/blob/master/README.md#properties)on GitHub. 1 #### Paste your connection string. If you have the connection string for your deployment available, you can paste the string directly into the dialog box. You can use either the [Standard Connection String Format](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#connections-standard-connection-string-format)or the [DNS Seedlist Connection Format.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#connections-dns-seedlist) * To obtain the connection string for an Atlas cluster:  \n   1. Navigate to your Atlas Clusters view.  \n   2. Click Connect for your desired cluster.  \n   3. Click Connect with MongoDB Compass.  \n   4. Copy the provided connection string.\n* To learn how to format the connection string for a deployment which is not hosted on Atlas, see[Connection String URI

Collection](#create-a-collection)\n* [Drop a Collection](#drop-a-collection)\n* [Collection Details](#collection-details)\n* [Limitations](#limitations) A collection is a grouping of MongoDB[documents](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/documents/#std-label-compass-documents). Documents within a collection can have different fields. A collection is the equivalent of a table in a relational database system. A collection exists within a single [database](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/databases/#std-label-database-tab) ## Collections Screen The Collections screen lists the existing[collections](#std-label-compass-collections) and[views](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/views/#std-label-compass-views) in the selected database. Each list item includes the name and other general information for the collection or view. To access the Collections screen for a database, from the[Databases screen](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/databases/) either: * Click a Database Name in the main Databasesview, or\n* Click a database in the left navigation. ![Select database](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/select-database.png) ### Collection Information The Collections screen displays the following information for each collection in the selected database: * Collection name\n* Number of [documents](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/documents/) in the collection  \n## Note  \nCompass bases the document count that appears on theCollections screen on cached metadata using[collStats](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/collStats/). This count might differ from the actual document count in the collection.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) # Sampling Sampling in MongoDB Compass is the selection of a subset of documents from a collection for analysis. Analyzing a sample set of data is a common statistical analysis technique; the results of analyzing a sample set tend to be similar to the results of analyzing an entire data set. Compass uses sampling for efficiency. Generally, standard sample sets can be selected and analyzed in a few seconds. Analyzing large samples or entire collections demands significantly more time and processing power. ## Sampling Method MongoDB Compass samples 1,000 documents from a collection using the[$sample](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sample/)operator via the[aggregation pipeline](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/).

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) # Analyze Your Data Schema On this page * [Overview](#overview)\n* [Query Bar](#query-bar)\n* [Field Descriptions](#field-descriptions)\n* [Query Builder](#query-builder)\n* [Analyze Location Data](#analyze-location-data)\n* [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) ## Overview The Schema tab provides an overview of the data type and shape of the fields in a particular collection. Databases and collections are visible in the left-side navigation. The overview is based on [sampling](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/sampling/#std-label-sampling)the documents in the collection. The schema overview may include additional data about the contents of the fields, such as the minimum and maximum values of dates and integers, the frequency of occurrence of particular values, and the cardinality of the data. MongoDB has a [flexible schema model](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/data-modeling-introduction/), which means that some fields may contain different types of data from one document to the next. For example, a field named `address` may contain strings and integers in some documents, objects in others, or some combination of all three. In the case of heterogenous fields, the Schema tab shows a breakdown of the various data types contained within the field with the percentage of each data type represented. ## Example The Schema tab shows size information about the`test.restaurants` collection at the top, including the total number of documents in the collection, the average document size, and the total disk space occupied by the collection. The following fields are shown with details: * The `_id` field is an[ObjectId](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/bson-types/index.html/#objectid). Each ObjectId contains a timestamp, so Compass displays the range of creation times for the sampled documents.\n* The `address` field contains four nested fields. You can expand the field panel to see analyses of each of the nested fields.\n* The `borough` field contains a string indicating the borough in which the restaurant is located. The cardinality is low enough that Compass can provide a graded bar of the field contents, with the most-frequently occurring string on the left.\n* The `categories` field contains arrays of strings. The analysis shows the minimum, maximum, and average array lengths. ![Example of a collection's schema](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/collection-schema.png) ## Query Bar Using the [query bar](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/query/filter/#std-label-compass-query-bar) in the Schema tab, you can create a query filter to limit your result set. Click theOptions button to specify query options, such as the particular fields to display and the number of results to return. ![Query bar schema view](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/query-bar-schema-view.png) ## Tip In the Schema tab, you can also use the [Query Builder](#std-label-build-query) to enter a query into the query bar. ## Field Descriptions For each field, Compass displays summary information about the data type or types the field contains and the range of values. Depending on the data type and the level of cardinality, Compass displays histograms, graded bars, geographical maps, and sample data to provide a sense of the shape and scope of the data contained in each field. ### Field with a Single Data Type Below is an example of the data type summary for a field called`last_login` which contains data of type `date`. ![Example of a field with a single data type](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/field-example.png) ### Field with Multiple Data Types For fields that contain multiple data types, Compass displays a percentage breakdown of the various data types across documents. In the example below, the chart shows the contents of a field called `phone_no` in which 81% of documents are of type `string`, and the remaining 19% are of type `number`. ![Example of percentage

![Example of sparcely applied data type](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/field-sparsity.png) ### Strings Strings can appear in three different ways. If there are entirely unique strings in a field, Compass shows a random selection of string values from the specified field. Click the circular refresh icon to see a new set of randomly selected values from the field. ![Example of string data types](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/string-sample.png) If there are only a few different string values, Compass shows the strings in a single graded bar which shows the percentage of the population of the string values. ![Example of few string data types](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/string-sample2.png) If there are multiple string values with some duplicates, Compass shows a histogram indicating the frequency of each string found within the field. ![Example of string data types as a histogram](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/string-sample3.png) ## Note Move the mouse over each bar to display a tooltip which shows the value of the string. ### Numbers Numbers are similar to strings in their representation. Unique numbers are shown in the following manner: ![Example of number data type](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/number-sample.png) Duplicate numbers are shown in a histogram that indicates their frequency: ![Example of duplicate number data types](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/number-sample2.png) ### Dates and ObjectIDs Fields that represent dates (and fields that contain the ObjectID data type, which includes a timestamp) are shown across multiple bar charts. The two charts on the top row represent the day of the week and time of day of the timestamp value. The single chart on the bottom shows the first and last timestamp value, and the vertical lines represent the distribution of the timestamp across the range of first to last. ![Example of Date data types](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/date-sample.png) ### Embedded Documents and Arrays Fields that contain a sub-document or an array are displayed with a small triangle next to them and a visual representation of the data contained within the sub-document or array. ![Example of fields with embedded documents or arrays](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/embedded-document-sample.png) Click on the triangle to expand the field and view the embedded documents: ![Expanding the embedded documents](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/embedded-document-sample2.png) ### GeoJSON and `[longitude,latitude]` Arrays Fields that contain GeoJSON data or `[longitude,latitude]` arrays are displayed with interactive maps. For more information on interacting with location data in Compass, see [Analyze Location Data.](#std-label-analyze-location-data) ![Example of GeoJSON data types](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/geo-visualization.png) ## Note Third party mapping services are not available inCompass Isolated Edition. ### View Charts of Mixed Types If a field has mixed types, you can view different charts of each type by clicking on the `type` field. In the example below, the `age`field shows the values that are strings: ![Example of a field with mixed types](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/mixed-sample.png) Clicking on the `number` type causes the chart to show its numeric data: ![Example that shows numeric data for number type](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/mixed-sample2.png) ## Query Builder In the Schema tab, you can type the filter manually into the query bar or generate the filter with the Compass query builder. The query builder allows you to select data elements from one or more fields in your schema and construct a query matching the selected elements. ## Tip You can compose the initial query filter by using the clickable query builder and then manually edit the generated filter to your exact requirements. The following procedure describes the steps involved in building a complex query with the query bar. 1 ### Click the chart value. In the Schema view, you can click on a chart value to build a query.

2 ### Optional. Select multiple values. To select multiple values for a field, click and drag the cursor over a selection of values, or press shift+click on the desired values. ![Exmaple of selecting multimple values for a field](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/query-builder3.png) 3 ### Optional.

Click Resetto clear your query. ## Analyze Location Data In the Schema tab, you can use interactive maps to filter and analyze location data. If your field contains[GeoJSON data](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/geojson/) or`[longitude,latitude]` arrays, the Schema tab displays a map containing the points from the field. The data type for location fields is `coordinates`. ![Image showing example field with location data](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/location-data-example.png) ### Apply a Location Filter You can apply a filter to the map to only analyze a specific range of points. To define a location filter: 1. Click the Circle button at the top-right of the map.\n2. Click and drag on the map to draw a circle containing the area of the map you want to analyze.\n3. Repeat this process as desired to include additional areas of the map in the schema analysis. ![Image showing map with filter circles drawn](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/location-data-filter.png) The query bar updates as you draw location filters to show the exact coordinates used in the[$geoWithin](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/geoWithin/) query applied to the schema analysis. If you specify multiple location filters, the query becomes an [$or](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/or/) query with multiple `$geoWithin` operators. ### Edit a Location Filter To move or resize a location filter, click  on the right side of the map. You will enter the filter editing mode, which looks like this: ![Image showing map filter editing](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/location-data-filter-edit.png) To move a filter Click and drag the square in the center of the circle. To resize a filter Click and drag the square at the edge of the circle. After modifying your filters, click Save. ### Delete a Location Filter To delete a location filter from the map: 1. Click  on the right side of the map.\n2. Either click:  \n   * A location filter to delete that filter.  \n   * Clear All to delete all location filters.\n3. Click Save. ## Troubleshooting If the analysis of your schema times out, it might be because the collection you are analyzing is very large, causing MongoDB to stop the operation before the analysis is complete. Increase the value of`MAX TIME MS` to allow the operation time to complete. To increase the value of MAX TIME MS: 1. In the query bar, expand Options.  \n![The Options button is on the right side of the query bar,  \nnext to the Analyze button.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/max-time-ms.png)\n2. Increase the value of MAX TIME MS to accommodate your collection.MAX TIME MS defaults to 60000 milliseconds, or 60 seconds, but large collections might take tens of seconds to analyze. Once you have increased the value of MAX TIME MS, retry your schema analysis by clicking Analyze. ← [Manage Indexes](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/indexes/ \"Previous Section\")[Export Your

View](#create-a-view)\n* [Open a View](#open-a-view)\n* [Duplicate a View](#duplicate-a-view)\n* [Modify the Source of a View](#modify-the-source-of-a-view)\n* [Drop a View](#drop-a-view) Views are read-only results of an[aggregation](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/aggregation-pipeline-builder/#std-label-compass-agg-builder) run against a collection. Views provide easy access to the results of an aggregation without requiring the reader of the view to execute the pipeline. Views can also help keep your data secure by only giving users access to a predefined result set, as opposed to having access to the underlying collection. ## Collections Screen The Collections screen lists the existing[collections](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/collections/#std-label-compass-collections) and[views](#std-label-compass-views) in the selected database. Each list item includes the name and other general information for the collection or view. To access the Collections screen for a database, from the[Databases screen](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/databases/) either: * Click a Database Name in the main Databasesview, or\n* Click a database in the left navigation. ![Select database](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/select-database.png) Compass displays views in the Collections Screenwith a special icon, and indicates the collection from which the view was created. ![View list](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/view-list.png) ### View Information The Collections screen displays the following information for each view in the selected database: * View name\n* Collection from which the view was created\n* Total size of all documents in the view\n* Total size of all indexes on the collection ## Create a View To create a view, you must use the [Aggregation Pipeline Builder](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/aggregation-pipeline-builder/#std-label-compass-agg-builder). The output of your pipeline's final stage becomes the content of the view. To create a view from your pipeline results: 1. Create an aggregation pipeline in the pipeline builder.

Database](#create-a-database)\n* [Drop a Database](#drop-a-database)\n* [Limitations](#limitations) A database is a container for [collections](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/collections/#std-label-collection-tab). Each database gets its own set of files on the host file system. A single MongoDB server typically has multiple databases. ## Databases Tab The Databases tab lists the existing databases for your MongoDB deployment. To access the Databases tab, click the cluster name in the upper left corner and select theDatabases tab. ![Database Tab](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/database-tab.png) From this view, you can click a database name in the list to view its[collections](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/collections/). Alternatively, you can view database collections by clicking the desired database in the left-hand navigation. You can also [create](#std-label-create-database) or[drop databases](#std-label-drop-database) from this view. ## Create a Database 1 ### Click the Create Database button. From the [Databases](#std-label-database-tab) tab, click theCreate Database button to bring up theCreate Database dialog. 2 ### Enter database and first collection information. In the dialog, enter the name of the database to create and its first collection. Both the database name and the collection name are required. If you want to create a [capped collection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/capped-collections/), select the Capped Collection checkbox and enter the maximum bytes.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) # Compass Configuration File On this page * [Use Cases](#use-cases)\n* [Configuration File Location](#configuration-file-location)\n* [Behavior](#behavior)\n* [Tasks](#tasks) You can configure MongoDB Compass settings using a configuration file. Configure settings with a configuration file to maintain consistent behavior betweenCompass sessions. ## Use Cases Use the configuration file to specify Compass settings and behaviors. For example: * If your deployment has strict privacy requirements, you can configureCompass to block outgoing network connections.\n* If you need to restrict what actions users can perform in Compass, you can disable the embedded shell and make Compass read-only.\n* If you have multiple team members using Compass, you can use a common configuration file to ensure a consistent user experience. ## Configuration File Location * For macOS and Linux, the configuration file is located at `/etc/mongodb-compass.conf`.\n* For Windows, the configuration file is located at `<path\\to\\compass>\\..\\mongodb-compass.cfg`. ## Behavior When you configure settings with a configuration file: * You can not modify settings set in the configuration file after startup.\n* You can specify the configuration file in either EJSON or YAML format.\n* To view all available Compass configuration options, run the following command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass executable:  \n`| <path-to-Compass-executable> --help |  \n| ----------------------------------- |  \n` ## Tasks To see how to configure specific settings, see [Compass Configuration File

not working?](#why-are-some-features-of-compass-not-working-)\n* [How do I view and modify my Privacy Settings?](#how-do-i-view-and-modify-my-privacy-settings-) ## What is the Compass Isolated Edition? Compass Isolated Edition restricts network requests to only the MongoDB server chosen on the[Connect](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/#std-label-connect-run-compass) screen. All other outbound connections are not permitted in this edition, meaning no additional firewall configuration is required when running Compass Isolated Edition. ## What is the performance impact of running this tool? Testing has shown that MongoDB Compass has minimal impact in prototype deployments, though additional performance testing and monitoring is in progress. You should only execute queries that are indexed appropriately in the database to avoid scanning the entire collection. ## How does Compass handle confidential data? MongoDB Compass stores and retrieves sensitive data such as passwords using a credentials API specific to the operating system runningCompass. The credentials API securely handles sensitive information by encrypting and protecting access to your data. MongoDB Compass stores the following data using the credentials API: * MongoDB server passwords,\n* SSH passwords for tunneling,\n* TLS/SSL passphrases MongoDB Compass utilizes a node.js native add-on, [Keytar](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar), to communicate with and store data in the operating system's credentials API. For more information on how Keytar operates and the specific APIs it accesses, refer to the[Keytar Github documentation](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar). ## Does Compass Maintain Logs? As part of normal operation, MongoDB Compass maintains a running log of events. Compass logs provide a history of operations and can help diagnose errors. For more information on Compass logs, including their format and location, see [Retrieve Compass Logs.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/troubleshooting/logs/#std-label-compass-logs) ## Why am I seeing a warning about a non-genuine MongoDB server? Starting in MongoDB Compass 1.19, Compass displays a warning message when connected to non-genuine MongoDB instances as these instances may behave differently from the official MongoDB instances; e.g. missing or incomplete features, different feature behaviors, etc. ## What happens to long running queries? As a precaution, Compass aborts long running queries to prevent excessive querying on your database. ### Slow Sampling All queries that Compass sends to your MongoDB instance have a timeout flag set which automatically aborts a request if it takes longer than the specified timeout. This timeout is currently set to 10 seconds. If[sampling](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/sampling/#std-label-sampling) on the database takes longer, Compass will notify you about the timeout and give you the options of (a) retrying with a longer timeout (60 seconds) or (b) running a different query. ## Note Sampling time may be affected by a number of factors, like load on the server, number of documents and existence of a suitable index for your query. It is recommended that you only increase the sampling timeout if you are not connected to a production instance, as this may negatively affect the performance and response time of your database. ###

## Why are some features of MongoDB Compass not working? If you can connect to your MongoDB instance using MongoDB Compass but some features do not work as expected, your system firewall may be blocking network requests required by MongoDB Compass. MongoDB Compass must connect to external services to enable features such as: * Third party mapping services\n* Intercom\n* Bugsnag for error reporting To fix this issue, configure your system firewall to allow incoming connections for MongoDB Compass. Ensure ports `80` and `443` are open between MongoDB Compass and the host for the MongoDB deployment to which Compass connects. Compass Isolated Edition restricts network requests to only the MongoDB server chosen on the[Connect](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/#std-label-connect-run-compass) screen. All other outbound connections are not permitted in this edition, meaning no additional firewall configuration is required when running Compass Isolated Edition. ## How do I view and modify my Privacy Settings? To view and modify your MongoDB Compass privacy settings, from the top-level menu: 1. Click Help.\n2. Click Settings.\n3. Under Settings, click Privacy. The privacy settings dialog allows you to toggle variousMongoDB Compass settings such as enabling crash reports and automatic updates. See the following screenshot for all available privacy settings options: ![Privacy settings](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/privacy-settings.png) ## Note Crash reports and automatic updates are not available inCompass Isolated Edition. ### How do I enable geographic visualizations? You can enable geographic visualizations in MongoDB Compass in your privacy settings. When Enable Geographic Visualizations is selected, MongoDB Compass is allowed to make requests to a third-party mapping service. ## Note Third party mapping services are not available inCompass

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) # Import Pipeline from Text On this page * [Syntax](#syntax)\n* [Procedure](#procedure) You can import aggregation pipelines from plain text into the [Aggregation Pipeline Builder](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/aggregation-pipeline-builder/#std-label-compass-agg-builder) to easily modify and execute your pipelines. Importing a plain text aggregation pipeline shows how each stage of the pipeline affects the output, and illustrates the effects of modifying specific pipeline stages using the Pipeline Builder's Output panes. ## Note ### Importing Pipelines From Text Starting in Compass 1.35, the import pipeline button has been removed from the Compass GUI. The full functionality of importing pipelines from text is still supported as part of the View Pipeline as Text edit mode. ## Syntax The imported pipeline must be: * In the [MongoDB query language](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/query-documents/), this is the same syntax used in the `pipeline` parameter of the[aggregate()](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.aggregate/#mongodb-method-db.collection.aggregate) method.\n* An array, even if there is only one stage in the pipeline. ## Procedure 1 In the aggregation pipeline pane, click the</> Text toggle switch to enable text mode for pipeline editing. ![Toggle Textview Mode on](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/agg-builder-textview-toggle-on.png) 2 Type or paste an aggregation pipeline into the text editor. The text editor provides real-time linting for correct syntax and debugging information. For example, the following pipeline consists of a single[$limit](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/limit/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-limit) stage: `| [ { \"$limit\" : 4 } ] |\n| -------------------- | ` ![Edit aggregation pipeline](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/agg-builder-textview-edit.png) After you import your pipeline, you can click the {} Stagesswitch to return to stage view mode. In this mode you can modify individual stages to see the results reflected in theOutput of each respective stage. ← [Aggregation Pipeline

Connections](#allow-keychain-access-for-recent-and-favorite-connections)\n* [Migrate to Compass from Compass Community](#migrate-to-compass-from-compass-community) To ensure that you are using the latest Compass features and improvements, it is recommended to use the latest version ofMongoDB Compass. To upgrade Compass, you can either manually install the latest version or enable automatic updates. ## Manually Install the Latest Version of Compass You can download and install the latest version of Compass from the[MongoDB Downloads](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass?tck=docs%5Fcompass) page at any time. Check the [Software Requirements](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/install/#std-label-software-reqs) for your operating system and desired version of Compass to ensure Compass is compatible with your system. You do not need to uninstall previous versions of Compass to upgrade. ## Note If you are running macOS Catalina or later, you may have to modify your system settings to grant Compass permission to run. For more information, see [Install Compass.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/install/#std-label-compass-install) ## Enable Automatic Updates You can enable automatic updates to the latest version of Compass on theHelp > Privacy Settings dialog. ![Privacy settings](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/privacy-settings.png) MongoDB Compass does not install any updates without your explicit permission. Instead, Compass prompts you to upgrade when a new version is available. ## Allow Keychain Access for Recent and Favorite Connections On macOS systems, the first time that you update MongoDB Compass to version 1.20 or later, you will need to allow access to your system storage**for each** saved connection in Recents andFavorites. When prompted for your keychain password, click Always Allowto prevent being prompted for your password in the future. This ensures MongoDB Compass has access to your saved connections when updating to new versions. ## Migrate to Compass from Compass Community To migrate from Compass Community edition to the fully-featured edition of Compass and retain any saved data such as saved connection strings and favorite queries, you must migrate that data to your new edition of MongoDB Compass. MongoDB Compass stores saved connections, queries, and aggregation pipelines in folders in your file system.

The default data type for all fields is string. ![Select fields to import from a CSV file](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/import-csv-options.png) To exclude a field from a CSV file you are importing, uncheck the checkbox next to that field name. To select a type for a field, use the dropdown menu below that field name. 6 #### Configure import options. Under Options, configure the import options for your use case. If you are importing a CSV file, you may select how your data is delimited. For both JSON and CSV file imports, you can toggleIgnore empty strings and Stop on errors: * If checked, Ignore empty strings drops fields with empty string values from your imported documents. The document is still imported with all other fields.\n* If checked, Stop on errors prevents any data from being imported in the event of an error. If unchecked, data is inserted until an error is encountered and successful inserts are not rolled back. The import operation will not continue after encountering an error in either case. 7 #### Click Import. A progress bar displays the status of the import. If an error occurs during import, the progress bar turns red and an error message appears in the dialog. After successful import, the dialog closes and Compass displays the collection page containing the newly imported documents. ## Export Data from a Collection MongoDB Compass can export data from a collection as either a**JSON** or **CSV** file. If you specify a[filter](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/query/filter/#std-label-query-bar-filter) or [aggregation pipeline](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/aggregation-pipeline-builder/#std-label-compass-agg-builder) for your collection, Compass only exports documents which match the specified query or

in version 1.14.0_ The Aggregation Pipeline Builder in MongoDB Compass lets you create[aggregation pipelines](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/) to process documents from a collection or view and return computed results. For example, you can use aggregation pipelines to: * Group values from multiple documents together.\n* Perform operations on the grouped data to return a single result.\n* Analyze data changes over time. To build an aggregation pipeline, choose a collection and click theAggregations tab. Compass displays a blank aggregation pipeline. The Preview of Documents in the Collection section shows 20 documents randomly sampled from the chosen collection. ## Note ### Atlas Search Stages When you connect Compass to a MongoDB deployment hosted on[Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs%5Fcompass), additional Atlas-only stages[$search](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/atlas-search/query-syntax/#-search) and[$searchMeta](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/atlas-search/query-syntax/#-searchmeta)are available in the Aggregation Pipeline Builder.

## Create an Aggregation Pipeline Aggregation pipelines can be created in two seperate modes: * Stage View Mode, a visual click-based pipeline editor that preloads pipeline syntax based on your selected stages.\n* Text View Mode, a text-based pipeline editor that accepts raw pipeline syntax. ### Stage View Mode   \n1 #### Toggle Stage View Mode In the aggregation pipeline pane, ensure the{} Stages toggle switch is selected: ![Toggle on stage view mode](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/agg-builder-stageview-toggle-on.png) 2 #### Add an aggregation pipeline stage. In the aggregation pipeline pane in the lower-left corner, click the Select... dropdown and select the[aggregation pipeline stage](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/) to use for the first stage of the pipeline: ![Aggregation Builder select stage](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/agg-builder-select-stage.png) 3 #### Fill in the pipeline stage. Fill in your selected stage. If you enable Preview, preview documents update automatically to the right of the stage to reflect the results of your pipeline as it progresses. You can adjust the width of the pipeline stage by dragging its border to the right. ![Aggregation Builder match stage example](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/agg-builder-match-stage.png) 4 #### Add additional pipeline stages. Click Add Stage to add additional aggregation stages below your last aggregation stage. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each additional stage. ## Note The toggle to the right of the name of each pipeline stage dictates whether that stage is included in the pipeline. Toggling a pipeline stage also updates the pipeline preview, which reflects whether or not that stage is included. The following pipeline excludes the first[$match](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/match/) stage and only includes the[$project](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/project/)stage: ![Aggregation Builder exclude stage example](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/agg-builder-exclude-stage-example.png) 5 #### Run the pipeline.

The +srv indicates to MongoDB Compass that the hostname that follows corresponds to a DNS SRV record. | 2 #### Enter a Hostname. In the Host field, enter the hosts or hostname of the server where the deployment is running. If you are running your deployment locally, this value is `localhost`. If you are connecting to an Atlas cluster, see[Connect to Database Deployment](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/connect-to-database-deployment/)for Atlas-specific guidance on how to connect with Compass. If you are not sure of your hostname, contact your Database Administrator for information. 3 #### (Optional) Enable Direct Connection. When you use the `mongodb` Connection String Scheme, you have the option to enable a [Direct Connection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/fundamentals/connection/#direct-connection). When you enable this setting, Compass runs all operations on the specified host. ## Important When you specify `directConnection` and connect to a secondary member of a replica set, your write operations fail because it is not the primary member. 3 ### (Optional) For advanced connection configuration options, click the [Advanced](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/advanced-connection/#std-label-advanced-connection-tab) tab. 4 ### Click Connect. ## Tip ### See also:  To disconnect from your deployment,

Encryption](#enable-and-disable-in-use-encryption) Queryable Encryption is in Public Preview and available for evaluation purposes. Public Preview is not recommended for production deployments as breaking changes may be introduced. To learn more about the Preview please see the [Queryable Encryption Preview](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-releases-queryable-encryption-preview/) blog post. In-Use Encryption allows you to connect to your deployments using [Queryable Encryption](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/core/queryable-encryption/). This connection method allows you to encrypt a subset of fields in your collections. You can also use [CSFLE](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/) to encrypt a subset of fields in your collection. CSFLE encryption is enabled through the schema editor. ## Overview This guide shows you how to connect to your deployment and collections using Queryable Encryption. This guide uses the [air\\_airlines.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/compass/air%5Fairlines.json)data set in the guided examples. The guide covers the process of importing your data set. ## Requirements and Limitations * In-Use Encryption is an Enterprise/Atlas only feature.\n* You need a replica set to use this connection option. Your replica set can be a single node or larger.\n* You need to connect to your deployment on Compass using In-Use Encryption. For more information on how to connect to your deployment, see [In-Use Encryption Connection tab.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/in-use-encryption/#std-label-in-use-encryption-tab) ## Create Your Encrypted Collection Once your deployment is connected using In-Use Encryption, create your collection using Queryable Encryption. You can create a new database and collection or you can create a new collection in an existing database. ### Procedure 1 Click the Create a Database button or theCreate a Collection button.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) # In-Use Encryption Connection Tab On this page * [Procedure](#procedure) Queryable Encryption is in Public Preview and available for evaluation purposes. Public Preview is not recommended for production deployments as breaking changes may be introduced. To learn more about the Preview please see the [Queryable Encryption Preview](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-releases-queryable-encryption-preview/) blog post. In-Use Encryption is an Enterprise/Atlas only feature. You need a replica set or sharded cluster to use this connection option. Your replica set can be a single node or larger. The In-Use Encryption connection tab allows you to connect your deployments using [Queryable Encryption.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/core/queryable-encryption/) ## Procedure 1 ### Click Advanced Connection Options. ![New Advanced Connection Options](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/advanced-connection-options.png) 2 ### Click the In-Use Encryption tab. 1 #### Provide a Key Vault Namespace. A Key Vault Namespace refers to a collection that contains all the data keys used for encryption and decryption. Specify a collection in which data encryption keys are stored in the format `<db>.<collection>`. The non-official default database/collection for keyVault is `encryption.__keyVault`. 2 #### Select a KMS Provider. You can select from the following Key Management Systems: * [Local KMS](#std-label-local-kms)\n* [AWS](#std-label-aws-compass-encryption)\n* [GCP](#std-label-gcp-compass-encryption)\n* [Azure](#std-label-azure-compass-encryption)\n* [KMIP](#std-label-kmip-compass-encryption) ##### Local KMS You can locally manage your key as a KMS using the[Local KMS](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/core/queryable-encryption/fundamentals/kms-providers/#local-key-provider)option. Click Generate Random Key to generate a 96-byte long base64-encoded string. You need this key to access encrypted and decrypted data. ## Warning Compass does not save KMS credentials by default.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) # Start Compass from the Command Line On this page * [Compass Executable Location](#compass-executable-location)\n* [Command Line Connection Specification](#command-line-connection-specification)\n* [Configuration File Connection Specification](#configuration-file-connection-specification) You can start a Compass session from the command line. In enterprise environments, a scripted start can make it easier to deploy Compass. For example, to limit access to sensitive systems, you can configure a command line start so that Compasscan run on a jump host. There are two ways to start Compass from the command line: * [Specify a connection string on the command line](#std-label-compass-connect-cmd-line)\n* [Specify connection details in a file](#std-label-compass-connect-file-based) If your connection string contains sensitive information, consider using a configuration file to avoid exposing that information on the command line. ## Compass Executable Location The name and location of the Compass executable varies by operating system. ### Linux The executable is called `mongodb-compass`. The installer installs it in the `/usr/bin` directory. ### Windows The executable is called `MongoDBCompass.exe`. The installer installs it in a folder you pick during the installation process. ### MacOS The executable is called `MongoDB Compass`. The installer installs it under the Applications folder: `| /Applications/MongoDB\\ Compass.app/Contents/MacOS/MongoDB\\ Compass |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ` ## Command Line Connection Specification The command line invocation for Compass has two components, the path to the Compass executable and a connection string. You can optionally provide the username and password on the command line or the configuration file. The format is: ```shell  <path/to/compass/executable>  <connection string>  --username <username> --password <password> \n``` ## Note If the username and password arguments are not provided, Compass uses the credentials in the connection string. ### Basic Connection String The following example uses a basic connection string for a [MongoDB University](https://learn.mongodb.com/) training cluster. Modify the connection details to connect to your MongoDB installation: ```shell mongodb-compass mongodb+srv://cluster0.xxxxxx.mongodb.net/library \n``` ### Username and Password Parameters This example uses the `username` and `password` parameters to authenticate Compass to the MongoDB deployment provided in the connection string: ```shell mongodb-compass mongodb+srv://cluster0.xxxxxx.mongodb.net/library --username user1 --password password1 \n``` ## Configuration File Connection Specification The command line invocation for Compass can specify a configuration file. The format is: ```shell <path/to/compass/executable> \\    --file=<filename> \\    [--passphrase=<passphrase>] \\    [<connection id>] \n``` The components of the command invocation are: * The path to the Compass executable\n* A connection configuration file\n* An optional passphrase for the connection configuration file\n* An optional connection id To create the connection configuration file, follow the steps to[export the connection details](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/favorite-connections/import-export-cli/export/#std-label-compass-export-connections-cli)from your Compass instance. The export process creates a file that includes all of your favorite connections. ## Important If you export your saved connections without using a passphrase, the configuration file contains the plaintext version of your username and password. Use a passphrase to encrypt the password. To open Compass and connect to your MongoDB instance, use a command line like: ``` mongodb-compass --file=learningConnectionFile \\                 --passphrase=superSecret \n``` If you have multiple favorites, include the connection id from the configuration file to specify which connection to use: ``` mongodb-compass --file=multipleConnectionFile \\                 --passphrase=superSecret \\

allows you to connect to deployments that require authentication. To learn about authentication mechanisms within MongoDB, see [Authentication Mechanisms.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/authentication/#authentication-mechanisms) ## Procedure 1 ### Click Advanced Connection Options. ![New Advanced Connection Options](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/advanced-connection-options.png) 2 ### Click the Authentication tab. Select your authentication method from the following options: * [Username / Password](#std-label-username-password)\n* [X.509](#std-label-x509)\n* [Kerberos](#std-label-kerberos-authentication)\n* [LDAP](#std-label-ldap-authentication)\n* [AWS IAM](#std-label-aws-iam-authentication) #### Username / Password Provide the following information: * Username\n* Password\n* (Optional) [Authentication Database](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-users/#authentication-database)\n* Authentication Mechancism:  \n   * Default  \n         \n   The `Default` setting selects the first authentication mechanism supported by the server according to an order of preference.  \n         \n   With the `Default` setting, MongoDB tries to authenticate using the following mechanisms in the order they are listed:  \n         1. `SCRAM-SHA-256`  \n         2. `SCRAM-SHA-1`  \n         3. `MONGODB-CR`  \n   * [SCRAM-SHA-1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-scram/)  \n   * [SCRAM-SHA-256](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-scram/) #### X.509 Select X.509 if the deployment uses [X.509](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-x.509/) as its authentication mechanism. ## Note X.509 Authentication requires a client certificate. To enable TLS and add a client certificate, see the [TLS / SSL tab](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/tls-ssl-connection/#std-label-tls-ssl-tab)in Compass. #### Kerberos Select Kerberos if the deployment uses [Kerberos](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/kerberos/) as its authentication mechanism.

##### Authenticate as a Different Kerberos User on Windows When you authenticate with Kerberos on Windows, thePrincipal you specify must match the principal of the security context that Compass is running. Normally, this is the logged-in user who is running Compass. To authenticate as a different Kerberos user, run MongoDB Compass as the chosen user and specify the Principal for that user. To run MongoDB Compass as a different user, either: * Hold Shift and right-click the MongoDB Compass program icon to select Run as a different user.\n* Use the `runas` command-line tool. For example, the following command runs MongoDB Compass as a user named `admin`:  \n`| runas /profile /user:mymachine\\admin <path to MongoDB Compass> |  \n| -------------------------------------------------------------- |  \n` After you start MongoDB Compass as the chosen user, to authenticate against your Kerberos-enabled MongoDB deployment, specify thePrincipal for the corresponding user. #### LDAP Select LDAP if the deployment uses [LDAP](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-ldap-external/) as its authentication mechanism. Provide the following information: * Username\n* Password #### AWS IAM Select AWS IAM if the deployment uses [AWS IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) as its authentication mechanism. The following fields are optional as they can be defined on your platform using their respective AWS IAM environment variables. MongoDB Compass will use these environment variable values to authenticate; you do not need to specify them in the connection string. * (Optional) AWS Access Key Id\n* (Optional) AWS Secret Access Key\n* (Optional) AWS Session Token 3 ### (Optional) For advanced connection configuration options, click the [Advanced](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/advanced-connection/#std-label-advanced-connection-tab) tab. 4 ### Click Connect. ## Tip ### See also:  To disconnect from your deployment,

Compass removes the connection from the Favoriteslist and returns the New Connection form to the default state. ## Considerations * On macOS systems, the first time that you update MongoDB Compass to version 1.20 or later, you will need to allow access to your system storage**for each** saved connection in Recents andFavorites. To learn more, see [Allow Keychain Access for Recent and Favorite Connections.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/upgrade/#std-label-keychain-access)\n* If you run MongoDB Compass on KDE Linux, you must have GNOME Keyring installed to successfully load saved connections. The Electron module[Keytar](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar) uses GNOME Keyring to securely store the database credentials for your connections. ← [Required

shared deployment, export and share your saved connections. Colleagues can import your saved connections, or you can use them yourself in your other workspaces. You can manage saved connections in the Compass UI or with the Compass CLI. ## Important ### Export Contains Sensitive Information By default, when you export saved connections, passwords are included in plaintext. To protect sensitive connection information, encrypt the exported file with a passphrase. When you do, users must specify the matching passphrase to import the connections. ## Tasks To learn how to export and import saved connections in the Compass UI, see: * [Export Saved Connections in Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/favorite-connections/import-export-ui/export/#std-label-compass-export-connections-ui)\n* [Import Saved Connections in

[Export Encrypted Saved Connections](#export-encrypted-saved-connections)\n* [Procedure](#procedure)\n* [Example](#example)\n* [Export Unencrypted Saved Connections](#export-unencrypted-saved-connections)\n* [Procedure](#procedure-1)\n* [Example](#example-1)\n* [Next Steps](#next-steps) You can use the Compass CLI to export saved connections. Colleagues can import your saved connections, or you can use them yourself in your other workspaces. ## About This Task When you export saved connections, Compass exports the list of connections as a JSON file. By default, when you export saved connections, passwords are included in plaintext. To protect sensitive connection information, encrypt the exported file with a passphrase. ## Export Encrypted Saved Connections This section shows how to export encrypted saved connections. When you encrypt the export file, users must specify the matching passphrase to import the connections. ### Procedure To export encrypted saved connections with the Compass CLI, specify: * The path to the MongoDB Compass executable. The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating system.\n* The `--export-connections` option set to the destination of the output file.\n* The `--passphrase` option set to a passphrase used to encrypt the output file. Your operation should resemble the following prototype: `| <path-to-Compass-executable> \\    |\n| --------------------------------- |\n| --export-connections=<filename> \\ |\n| --passphrase=<passphrase>         | ` ### Example This example exports saved Compass connections to a file with the path `/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json`. The exported file is encrypted with the passphrase `abc123`. Run the following command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass executable: ```shell ./MongoDB\\ Compass \\ --export-connections=/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json \\ --passphrase=abc123 \n``` ## Note The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating system. The preceding command is for macOS.

the`connectionSecrets` field. ## Export Unencrypted Saved Connections This section shows how to export unencrypted saved connections. If you do not encrypt the export file, database usernames and passwords are exported in plaintext. Only export unencrypted connections if no other users will have access to the exported file. ### Procedure To export encrypted saved connections with the Compass CLI, specify: * The path to the MongoDB Compass executable. The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating system.\n* The `--export-connections` option set to the destination of the output file. Your operation should resemble the following prototype: ```shell <path-to-Compass-executable> \\ --export-connections=<filename> \n``` ### Example This example exports saved Compass connections to a file with the path `/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json`. Run the following command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass executable: ```shell ./MongoDB\\ Compass \\ --export-connections=/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json \n``` ## Note The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating system. The preceding command is for macOS. You will see this output: ```shell Exporting connections to \"/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json\" (without passphrase) \n``` #### Results After the export completes, the`/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json` file resembles the following: ``` {   \"type\": \"Compass Connections\",   \"version\": {     \"$numberInt\": \"1\"   },   \"connections\": [     {

[Procedure](#procedure)\n* [Select Export saved connections.](#select-export-saved-connections.)\n* [Next Steps](#next-steps) You can export saved connections in MongoDB Compass. Colleagues can import your saved connections, or you can use them in your other workspaces. ## About This Task When you export saved connections, Compass exports the list of connections as a JSON file. By default, when you export saved connections, passwords are included in plaintext. To protect sensitive connection information, encrypt the exported file with a passphrase. ## Procedure To export encrypted saved connections with Compass: 1 On the Connect screen, hover over Saved Connections in the left-side navigation and click the Ellipses (...) button. 2 ### Select Export saved connections. 3 In the Export saved connections dialog box, select the connection names you want to export. 4 Under Target File, click Select a file...to specify the output file destination. 5 _Optional_. Toggle Remove secrets to omit passwords, access tokens, and other sensitive information from the exported file. If you select Remove secrets, you cannot specify an encryption password. 6 _Optional_. Specify an Encryption Password to encrypt passwords, access tokens, and other sensitive information. If you do not encrypt the export file, passwords are exported in plaintext. Only export unencrypted connections if no other users will have access to the exported file. 7 Click Export to export your saved connections to a JSON file. ## Next Steps To learn how to import saved connections, see[Import Saved Connections in Compass.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/favorite-connections/import-export-ui/import/#std-label-compass-import-connections-ui) ← [Export

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) # Import Saved Connections with the CLI On this page * [Prerequisite](#prerequisite)\n* [Import Encrypted Saved Connections](#import-encrypted-saved-connections)\n* [Procedure](#procedure)\n* [Example](#example)\n* [Errors](#errors)\n* [Import Unencrypted Saved Connections](#import-unencrypted-saved-connections)\n* [Procedure](#procedure-1)\n* [Example](#example-1) You can use the Compass CLI to import saved connections. This lets you use saved connections from other workspaces or connections used by other team members. ## Prerequisite To import saved connections, you must first [export the connections.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/favorite-connections/import-export-cli/export/#std-label-compass-export-connections-cli) ## Import Encrypted Saved Connections Use this procedure to import a list of saved connections that is[encrypted with a passphrase.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/favorite-connections/import-export-cli/export/#std-label-compass-export-connections-cli-encrypted) ### Procedure To import unencrypted saved connections with the Compass CLI, specify: * The path to the MongoDB Compass executable. The name and filepath of the executable depend on your operating system.\n* The `--import-connections` option set to the destination of the file containing saved connections.\n* The `--passphrase` option set to the passphrase used to encrypt the exported file. Your operation should resemble the following prototype: `| <path-to-Compass-executable> \\    |\n| --------------------------------- |\n| --import-connections=<filename> \\ |\n| --passphrase=<passphrase>         | ` ### Example The following example imports saved Compass connections from a file with the path`/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json` that is encrypted with the passphrase `abc123`. Run the following command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass executable: ```shell ./MongoDB\\ Compass \\ --import-connections=/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json \\ --passphrase=abc123 \n``` ## Note The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating system. The preceding command is for macOS. #### Results After you run the import command, you will see this output: ```shell Importing connections from \"/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json\" (with passphrase) \n``` MongoDB Compass starts and you will see the imported connections underSaved Connections on the Connect screen. ### Errors When you try to import encrypted saved connections, you may see these errors: * If do not specify a passphrase, you will see this error:  \n```shell  \nFailed to perform operation Be [Error]: Input file contains encrypted  \nsecrets but no passphrase was provided  \n```\n* If you specify an incorrect passphrase, you will see this error:  \n```shell  \nFailed to perform operation Be [Error]: Cannot decrypt due to corrupt  \ndata or wrong passphrase  \n``` ## Import Unencrypted Saved Connections Use this procedure to import a list of saved connections that is not encrypted with a passphrase. ### Procedure To import unencrypted saved connections with the Compass CLI, specify: * The path to the MongoDB Compass executable. The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating system.\n* The `--import-connections` option set to the destination of the file containing saved connections. Your operation should resemble the following prototype: ```shell <path-to-Compass-executable> --import-connections=<filename> \n``` ### Example The following example imports saved Compass connections from a file with the path `/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json`. Run the following command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass executable: ```shell ./MongoDB\\ Compass --import-connections=/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json \n``` ## Note The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating system.

With JSON mode, you can now insert multiple documents at once.\n* Added support for querying UUIDs via the[Documents](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/documents/#std-label-documents-tab) query bar or in the[Aggregation Pipeline Builder.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/aggregation-pipeline-builder/#std-label-compass-agg-builder)\n* Added support for the following aggregation pipeline operators:  \n   * [$set](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/set/)  \n   * [$unset](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/unset/)  \n   * [$replaceWith](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/replaceWith/)\n* Improved inline documentation for aggregation pipeline arguments.\n* Removed [$limit](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/limit/)ahead of the[$count](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/count/) stage in the aggregation pipeline builder to ensure accurate counts on large collections. Prior versions of MongoDB Compass placed a `$limit` stage before `$count` stages in the[Aggregation Pipeline Builder](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/aggregation-pipeline-builder/#std-label-compass-agg-builder) for large collections, even when sample mode was disabled.\n* Various bug fixes and

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) # Block Outgoing Network Connections On this page * [Consideration](#consideration)\n* [Procedure](#procedure)\n* [Command Line Example](#command-line-example)\n* [Configuration File Example](#configuration-file-example)\n* [Learn More](#learn-more) You can configure MongoDB Compass to not perform outgoing network operations other than those to the database. This lets you configure any[edition](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/editions/#std-label-compass-feature-table) of Compass to restrict outgoing connections in the same way [Compass Isolated Edition](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/faq/#std-label-compass-faq-isolated) restricts connections. ## Consideration When you block outgoing network connections, Compass can't use third-party mapping services in [schema visualizations.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/schema/#std-label-schema-tab) ## Procedure To block outgoing network operations, disable the `networkTraffic`configuration option. You can set configuration options in either a command line option or [configuration file](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/config-file/#std-label-config-file) option. ### Command Line Example The following command starts MongoDB Compass from the command line and sets the `--no-networkTraffic` option: `| <path-to-Compass-executable> --no-networkTraffic |\n| ------------------------------------------------ | ` ## Note The name and filepath of the Compass executable depend on your operating system. ### Configuration File Example You can specify the Compass configuration file in either EJSON or YAML format. The following configurations set the `networkTraffic`option to `false`: #### EJSON ``` { \"networkTraffic\": false } \n``` #### YAML ``` networkTraffic: false \n``` ## Learn More To learn more about

[Example Schema](#example-schema) You can export your schema after analyzing it. This is useful for sharing your schema and comparing schemas across collections. If you have not already done so, analyze your schema: 1. Select your desired collection and click the Schema tab.\n2. Click Analyze Schema. ## Note When Compass analyzes your schema, it samples a random subset of documents from your collection. To learn more about sampling, see [Sampling.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/sampling/#std-label-sampling) Once your schema has been analyzed, export your schema: 1. In the top menu bar, click Collection.\n2.

Starting in MongoDB Compass 1.31, you can load saved queries and aggregations from the My Queries view once you are connected to your cluster. This page explains how to add and view favorite queries and aggregations. ## Saving an Aggregation Pipeline You can save a pipeline so that you can find it later. If you load a saved pipeline, you can change it without changing the original saved copy. You can also create a [view](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/views/#std-label-view-details) from your pipeline results. To save your pipeline: 1 ### Click the save dropdown button Click the Save dropdown button at the top of the pipeline builder. Click on `Save pipeline as...` ![Save pipeline as](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/query-save-pipeline-as.png) 2 ### Enter a name for your pipeline ![Name your pipeline](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/query-save-pipeline-as-name.png) 3 ### Click Save ## Saving a Favorite Query You can favorite a query so that you can find it later.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) # Adjust Maximum Time for Query Operations The MAX TIME MS query bar option sets the cumulative time limit in milliseconds to process query bar operations. If the time limit is reached before the operation completes, Compassinterrupts the operation. ![MaxTimeMS Option](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/max-time-ms.png) The default MAX TIME MS value is 60000, or 60 seconds. Consider raising this value if you have a very large collection, or your operations are frequently timing out. You can also consider creating[indexes](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/indexes/#std-label-compass-indexes) to improve query performance. ## Set MAX TIME MS 1. Click Options.\n2. Adjust MAX TIME MS to the desired value in milliseconds. ## Learn More To learn more about MAX TIME MS,

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) # Sort the Returned Documents If the query bar displays the Sort option, you can specify the sort order of the returned documents. ## Set the Sort Order To set the sort order: 1. In the Query Bar, click Options.\n2. Enter the `sort` document into the Sort field.  \n   * To specify ascending order for a field, set the field to `1` in the sort document.  \n   * To specify descending order for a field, set the field and `-1` in the sort documents.  \n## Example  \nThe following `sort` document sorts results first by `year`in descending order, and within each year, sort by `name` in ascending order.  \n`| { year: -1, name: 1 } |  \n| --------------------- |  \n`  \nAs you type, the Find button is disabled and theSort label turns red until a valid query is entered.\n3. Click Find to run the query and view the updated results. ## Clear the Query To clear the query bar and the results of the query, clickReset. ## To Learn More See the `sort` entry in the[MongoDB Manual.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/cursor.sort/) ## How Does the Compass Query Compare to MongoDB and SQL Queries? [$sort](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sort/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-sort) corresponds to the `ORDER BY ...` clause in a SQL `SELECT` statement. ## Example You have 3,235 articles. You would like to see a list of articles sorted alphabetically by headline. SQL ``` SELECT * FROM article ORDER BY headline ASC; \n``` MongoDB Aggregation ```javascript db.article.aggregate(   { $sort : { headline : 1 } } ); \n``` Compass Sort Option ```javascript $sort : {

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) # Set Which Fields Are Returned If the query bar displays the Project option, you can specify which fields to return in the resulting data. By default, all fields are returned. To set a projection: 1. In the Query Bar, click Options.\n2. Enter the projection document into the Project field.  \nTo include fields:  \nSpecify the field name and set to `1` in the project document.  \n## Example  \n`| { year: 1, name: 1 } |  \n| -------------------- |  \n`  \nOnly the fields specified in the project document are returned. The `_id` field is returned unless it is set to `0` in theProject document.  \nTo exclude fields:  \nSpecify the field name and set to `0` in the project document.  \n## Example  \n```javascript  \n{ year: 0, name: 0 }  \n```  \nAll fields except for the fields specified in the project document are returned.  \nAs you type, the Find button is disabled and theProject label turns red until a valid query is entered.\n3. Click Find to run the query and view the updated results.  \n## Note  \nFor query result sets larger than 1000 documents, Compass shows a sampling of the results. Otherwise, Compass shows the entire result set.  \nFor details on sampling, see [Sampling.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/sampling/#std-label-sampling) ## To Learn More To learn how project works, see the `project` entry in the[MongoDB Manual.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/#std-label-find-projection) ## How Does the Compass Query Compare to MongoDB and SQL Queries? [$project](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/project/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-project) corresponds to choosing specific fields to return in a SQL `SELECT` statement. ## Example You have 3,235 articles. You would like to see only the headlines and authors of those articles.

[Steps](#steps)\n* [Next Steps](#next-steps) [Clustered collections](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/clustered-collections/) are collections with a clustered index. Clustered collections store documents ordered by [clustered index](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.createCollection/#std-label-db.createCollection.clusteredIndex)key value. You can use clustered collections when only one clustered index is necessary. ## Restrictions Clustered collection limitations: * The clustered index key must be on the `_id` field.\n* Clustered collections may not be [capped collections.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manualcapped-collection/) ## Steps 1 ### Open the Create Collection dialog box. Select a database and from the Collections screen, click theCreate Collection button. You can also click the `+` next to the name of the database you select to open the Create Collection dialog box. ![Create New Collection](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/new-collection.png) 2 ### Enter the collection name. 3 ### Select the type of collection you want to create. From the Advanced Collection Options drop-down, selectClustered Collections. 4 ### (Optional) Name your clustered index. You can enter a name for the clustered index or use the automatically generated name. 5 ### (Optional) Enter the number of seconds for the expireAfterSeconds field. The expireAfterSeconds field is a [TTL index](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/expire-data/)that enables automatic deletion of documents older than the specified number of seconds. The expireAfterSeconds field must be a positive, non-zero value. 6 ### Click Create Collection to create your new collection. In the Collections screen, your new collection is marked by aClustered badge next to the collection name. ## Next Steps * [Manage

[Restrictions and Limitations](#restrictions-and-limitations) Queryable Encryption is in Public Preview and available for evaluation purposes. Public Preview is not recommended for production deployments as breaking changes may be introduced. To learn more about the Preview please see the [Queryable Encryption Preview](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-releases-queryable-encryption-preview/) blog post. [Queryable Encryption](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/queryable-encryption/) allows you to encrypt a subset of fields in your collection. ## Procedure 1 ### Click the Create Collection button. From the Collections screen, click theCreate Collection button. 2 ### Enter the collection name. 3 ### Click the Advanced Collection Options dropdown. Check the Queryable Encryption option. 4 ### Specify an Encrypted Field. Specify which fields should be encrypted and whether they should be queryable. The following fields must be used if no existing keyId was specified for at least one encrypted field, and have no effect otherwise: * [KMS Provider.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/queryable-encryption/fundamentals/kms-providers/)\n* [Key Encryption Key.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/queryable-encryption/fundamentals/keys-key-vaults/) 5 ### Click Create Collection to create the collection. Your collection will be marked by a Queryable Encryptionbadge. ## Restrictions and Limitations * Your deployment must be connected using In-Use Encryption to encrypt your collection using Queryable Encryption.\n* Custom collation is the only Advanced Collection Optionthat can be used alongside Queryable Encryption. ← [Create a Clustered

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) # Create a Capped Collection On this page * [Procedure](#procedure)\n* [Restrictions and Limitations](#restrictions-and-limitations) [Capped Collections](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/capped-collections/) are fixed-sized collections that support high-throughput operations that insert and retrieve documents based on insertion order. ## Procedure 1 ### Click the Create Collection button. From the Collections screen, click theCreate Collection button. 2 ### Enter the collection name. 3 ### Click the Advanced Collection Options dropdown. Check the Capped Collection option. 4 ### Enter the size of the capped collection. Enter the maximum number of bytes that the collection can hold. 5 ### Click Create Collection to create the collection. ## Restrictions and Limitations The following restrictions and limitations apply when creating a capped collection: * Custom collation is the only Advanced Collection Optionthat can be used alongside your capped collection.\n* If you import a data set larger than the maximum size of the capped collection,Compass only loads the last documents of the data set and drops the oldest documents.\n* Once the collection is created, you cannot adjust the maximum number of bytes. ←

Queries?](#how-does-the-compass-query-compare-to-mongodb-and-sql-queries-)\n* [Examples](#examples) You can type MongoDB filter documents into the query bar to display only documents which match the specified criteria. To learn more about querying documents, see [Query Documents](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/query-documents/) in the MongoDB manual. ## Set Query Filter 1. In the Filter field, enter a filter document. You can use all of the MongoDB [query operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/) except the [$text](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/text/#mongodb-query-op.-text) and[$expr](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/expr/#mongodb-query-op.-expr) operators.  \n## Example  \nThe following filter only returns documents which have a `title`value of `Jurassic Park`:  \n`| { \"title\": \"Jurassic Park\" } |  \n| ---------------------------- |  \n`\n2. Click Find to run the query and view the updated results.  \n![Results of applying a query filter](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/querybar/query-filter-success.png)  \nclick to enlarge ## Note For query result sets larger than 1000 documents, Compass shows a sampling of the results. Otherwise, Compass shows the entire result set. For details on sampling, see [Sampling.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/sampling/#std-label-sampling) ## Supported Data Types in the Query Bar The Compass Filter supports using the[mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongo/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongo) shell mode representation of the MongoDB Extended JSON [BSON data types.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json/#bson-data-types-and-associated-representations) ## Example The following filter returns documents where`start_date` is greater than than the BSON `Date` `2017-05-01`: ```javascript { \"start_date\": {$gt: new Date('2017-05-01')} } \n``` By specifying the `Date` type in both `start_date` and the`$gt` comparison operator, Compass performs the `greater than` comparison chronologically, returning documents with`start_date` later than `2017-05-01`. Without the `Date` type specification, Compass compares the`start_dates` as strings[lexicographically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical%5Forder), instead of comparing the values chronologically. ## Clear the Query To clear the query bar and the results of the query, clickReset. ## How Does the Compass Query Compare to MongoDB and SQL Queries? [$filter](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/filter/#mongodb-expression-exp.-filter) corresponds to the `WHERE` clause in aSQL `SELECT` statement. ## Example You have 3,235 articles. You would like to see all articles that Joe Bloggs wrote. Compass Filter Option ```javascript { author : { $eq : \"Joe Bloggs\" } } \n``` MongoDB Aggregation ```javascript db.article.aggregate(   { $filter : { author : { $eq : \"Joe Bloggs\" } } } ); \n``` SQL ``` SELECT * FROM article WHERE author = \"Joe Bloggs\"; \n``` ## Examples ## Example The following examples use the JSON documents below as sample data.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Compass](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) # Create a Collection with Collation On this page * [Procedure](#procedure)\n* [Restrictions and Limitations](#restrictions-and-limitations) [Collation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/collation/) allows you to specify language-specific rules for string comparison, such as rules for lettercase and accent marks. ## Procedure 1 ### Click the Create Collection button. From the Collections screen, click theCreate Collection button. 2 ### Enter the collection name. 3 ### Click the Advanced Collection Options dropdown. Check the Use Custom Collaton option. 4 ### Select a value for locale. You are required to select a locale from the [MongoDB supported languages.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/collation-locales-defaults/#supported-languages-and-locales) All other collation options parameters are optional. For descriptions of the fields, see [Collation.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/collation/) 5 ### Click Create Collection to create the collection. ## Restrictions and Limitations The following restrictions apply when the parameter `numericOrdering`is set to `true`: * Only contiguous non-negative integer substrings of digits are considered in the comparisons. `numericOrdering` does not support:  \n   * `+`  \n   * `-`  \n   * exponents\n* Only Unicode code points in the Number or Decimal Digit (Nd) category are treated as digits.\n* If the number length exceeds 254 characters, the excess characters are treated as a separate number. ### Example Consider a collection with the following string number and decimal values: `| [                |\n| ---------------- |\n| { \"n\": \"1\" },    |\n| { \"n\": \"2\" },    |\n| { \"n\": \"-2.1\" }, |\n| { \"n\": \"2.0\" },  |\n| { \"n\": \"2.20\" }, |\n| { \"n\": \"10\"},    |\n| { \"n\": \"20\" },   |\n| { \"n\": \"20.1\" }, |\n| { \"n\": \"-10\" },  |\n| { \"n\": \"3\" }     |\n| ]                | ` The following find query uses a collation document containing the`numericOrdering` parameter: ```javascript  db.c.find(   { }, { _id: 0 }  ).sort(    { n: 1 }   ).collation( {    locale: 'en_US',    numericOrdering: true } ) \n``` For more information on querying documents in Compass, see[Query Your Data.](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/query/filter/#std-label-compass-query-bar) The operations returns the following results: ```javascript [    { \"n\": \"-2.1\" },    { \"n\": \"-10\" },    { \"n\": \"1\" },    { \"n\": \"2\" },    { \"n\": \"2.0\" }    { \"n\": \"2.20\" },    { \"n\": \"3\" },    { \"n\": \"10\" },    { \"n\": \"20\" },    {\"n\": \"20.1\" } ] \n``` * `numericOrdering: true` sorts the string values in ascending order as if they were numeric values.\n* The two negative values `-2.1` and `-10` are not sorted in the expected sort order because they have unsupported `-` characters. ← [Create a Capped Collection](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/collections/capped-collection/ \"Previous Section\")[Create a Clustered

Failed](#authentication-failed)\n* [Check the Compass Logs](#check-the-compass-logs)\n* [Additional Resources](#additional-resources) The sections on this page list common errors seen when connecting toMongoDB Compass and provide possible solutions. ## MongoDB Not Running on the Provided Host and Port Your connection failed when Compass attempted to connect to your database on the specified host and port. ### Likely Causes This error often occurs when: * You provide no hostname or an invalid hostname to the Compassconnect dialog.\n* The destination server rejects a connection on an incorrect port.\n* Your MongoDB cluster or server has been shutdown or the server hostname has changed.\n* You have a firewall actively blocking connections to/from your local network. ### Solutions The solution to this issue may depend on how your MongoDB environment is configured. Select the appropriate tab for your MongoDB environment to view possible solutions: ## Insert Document Button Disabled and Cannot Modify Documents When using Compass, you may be in a state where you cannot perform any write operations, and can only read data. ### Possible Observations When you are in this state: * The Create Collection and Insert Documentbuttons are disabled.\n* You cannot modify any of your documents. ### Likely Cause There are two likely causes for this behavior: * You are connected to a secondary member of your cluster, which does not support write operations.\n* You are using Compass Readonly edition, which does not support write operations. ### Solutions #### Check Read Preference Setting In the Compass [connection dialog](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/), set yourRead Preference to Primary. This will ensure that you connect to your cluster's primary member, which supports write operations. #### Check Replica Set Name Check that your Replica Set Name is accurate.Compass is only able to identify the primary correctly if the replica set name is accurate. If your cluster is hosted in Atlas, you can obtain the correct replica set name using the following procedure: 1. Navigate to your Atlas Clusters view.\n2. Click Connect for your desired cluster.\n3. Click Connect with MongoDB Compass.\n4. Copy the provided connection string.\n5. Open MongoDB Compass.\n6.

Atlas recognizes which entries in the whitelist include your current IP address, and appends these addresses with(includes your current IP address). ## Tip ### See also:  For more information on configuring whitelist entries, see[Configure Whitelist Entries](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-whitelist/) in theAtlas documentation. ## Not Master or Secondary is Not Writable This error message indicates that you have connected to one of the secondary members of a replica set without providing the correct replica set name _and_ requiring a connection to a primary in yourRead Preference. ### Solutions #### Verify Atlas Replica Set Name You should ensure that you are providing the correct replica set name in the Compass connect dialog. If your cluster is hosted in Atlas, you can obtain the correct replica set name using the following procedure: 1. Navigate to your Atlas Clusters view.\n2. Click Connect for your desired cluster.\n3. Click Connect with MongoDB Compass.\n4. Copy the provided connection string.\n5. Open MongoDB Compass.\n6. Click Yes to auto-fill the connection settings.  \n![Image showing autofill connection dialog](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/autofill-connect.png) #### Allow Compass to Connect to the Secondary Another approach to resolving this error is to allow Compass to connect to a secondary cluster member. Change yourRead Preference to either Primary Preferred orSecondary Preferred in your connection settings. This should allow you to bypass this error and connect. ## Note When you connect to a secondary cluster member, you cannot create or modify documents, indexes, or databases. Only use this solution when you do not need to perform any write operations. ## Tip ### See also:  For more information on read preferences, see[Read Preference](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/read-preference/) in the MongoDB manual. ## Authentication Failed When you attempt to connect to your cluster using Compass, you may encounter an error message statingAuthentication Failed. ### Likely Causes This error message is often the result of one of five conditions: * Your Password is missing after autofilling your connection details from a copied connection string. Compassrequires you to manually enter your password in the connection dialog as a security precaution.\n* Your Username and/or Password are incorrect.\n* You have not [configured any MongoDB users](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-add-mongodb-users/) for your Atlas cluster.\n* You did not select the correct Authentication method.\n* You did not specify the correct Authentication Database. This setting corresponds to the [authSource](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#urioption.authSource) connection string option.  \n## Note  \nFor Atlas clusters, the Authentication Database is usually `admin`. ### Solutions * Ensure you provided the correct Username andPassword.\n* Ensure that the MongoDB user you are authenticating as exists.\n* Verify your Authentication Database and authentication mechanism.\n* Verify that your selected authentication mechanism is supported by your MongoDB database. ## Check the Compass Logs The Compass logs can provide additional information on connection errors. You may find more detailed error messages to help diagnose your issue.

Important Inserting documents is not permitted inMongoDB Compass Readonly Edition. Compass provides two ways to insert documents into your collections: JSON Mode and a Field-by-Field Editor. JSON Mode (_New in Compass 1.20_) Allows you to write or paste JSON documents in the editor. Use this mode to insert multiple documents at once as an array. Field-by-Field Editor Provides a more interactive experience to create documents, allowing you to select individual field values and types. This mode only supports inserting one document at a time. ## Procedure To insert documents into your collection: 1. Click the Add Data dropdown and selectInsert Document.  \n![Insert button](https://mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/images/compass/insert-button.png)\n2. Select the appropriate view based on how you would like to insert documents.  \n   * Click the `{ }` brackets for JSON view. This is the default view.  \n   * Click the list icon for Field-by-Field mode.  \n    \n![Insert document in JSON
