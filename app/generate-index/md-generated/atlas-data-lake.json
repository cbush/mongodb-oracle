to be called \"Atlas Data Lake\"?** Atlas Data Lake is now called Atlas Data Federation. To learn more about the renamed federated query engine service, see [Atlas Data Federation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/data-federation/). ## Overview Atlas Data Lake is MongoDB's solution for storing and querying historical data from your Atlas cluster in a performant analytic storage service. The following pages guide you through the process of creating and connecting to a sample Data Lake in Atlas and running MongoDB Query Language (MQL) operations against the data in your Data Lake. * **Step 1:** [Create an Atlas Data Lake Pipeline.](https://mongodb.com/docs/datalake/tutorial/add-dataset-pipeline/#std-label-adl-add-pipeline)\n* **Step 2:** [Set Up a Federated Database Instance for

Uses](#sample-uses)\n* [Atlas Data Lake Regions](#atlas-data-lake-regions)\n* [Billing](#billing) **Looking for documentation for what used to be called \"Atlas Data Lake\"?** Atlas Data Lake is now called Atlas Data Federation. To learn more about the renamed federated query engine service, see [Atlas Data Federation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/data-federation/). ## About Atlas Data Lake MongoDB Atlas Data Lake is now an analytic-optimized object storage service for extracted data. Atlas Data Lake provides an analytic storage service optimized for flat or nested data with low latency query performance. ### Prerequisites Atlas Data Lake requires an `M10` or higher backup-enabled Atlas cluster with cloud backup jobs running on a specified cadence. To learn more about cloud backups, see [Back Up Your Database Deployment.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/backup/cloud-backup/overview/) ### Supported Types of Data Source Atlas Data Lake supports collection snapshots from Atlas clusters as a data source for extracted data. Atlas Data Lake automatically ingests data from the snapshots, and partitions and stores data in an analytics-optimized format. ## Sample Uses You can use Atlas Data Lake to: * Isolate analytical workloads from your operational cluster.\n* Provide a consistent view of cluster data from a snapshot for long running aggregations using `$out`.\n* Query and compare across versions of your cluster data at different points in time. ## Atlas Data Lake Regions Atlas Data Lake provides optimized storage in the following AWS regions: | Data Lake Regions  | AWS Regions    |\n| ------------------ | -------------- |\n| Virginia, USA      | us-east-1      |\n| Oregon, USA        | us-west-2      |\n| Sao Paulo, Brazil  | sa-east-1      |\n| Ireland            | eu-west-1      |\n| London, England    | eu-west-2      |\n| Frankfurt, Germany | eu-central-1   |\n| Mumbai, India      | ap-south-1     |\n| Singapore          | ap-southeast-1 |\n| Sydney, Australia  | ap-southeast-2 | Atlas Data Lake automatically selects the region closest to your Atlascluster for storing ingested data. ## Billing You incur Atlas Data Lake charges per GB per month based on the AWS region where the ingested data is stored. You incur Atlas Data Lake costs for the following items: * Ingestion of data from your data source\n* Storage on the cloud object storage ### Extraction Costs Atlas Data Lake charges you for the resources utilized to extract, upload, and transfer data. Atlas Data Lake charges for the [snapshot export](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/backup/cloud-backup/export/) operations is based on the following: * Cost per GB for snapshot extraction\n* Cost per hour on the AWS server for snapshot export download\n* Cost per GB per hour for snapshot export restore storage\n* Cost per IOPS per hour for snapshot export storage IOPS ### Storage Costs Atlas Data Lake charges for storing and accessing stored data is based on the following: * Cost per GB per day\n* Cost for every one thousand storage access requests when querying Data Lake datasets using Atlas Data Federation. Each access request corresponds to a partition of data from a Data Lake dataset that Atlas Data Federation fetches to process for a query.  \n## Note  \nYou can now set limits on the amount of data that Atlas Data Federation processes for your queries to control costs.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Atlas Data Lake](https://mongodb.com/docs/datalake/) # Run Queries Against Your Data Lake Dataset On this page * [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n* [Procedure](#procedure) This page guides you through the steps for running queries in[mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh) against Data Lake dataset for the `sample_mflix.movies`collection. ## Prerequisites Before you run the queries, you must complete the following using the examples shown in the procedures: * [Create an Atlas Data Lake Pipeline](https://mongodb.com/docs/datalake/tutorial/add-dataset-pipeline/#std-label-adl-add-pipeline) for the `sample_mflix.movies`collection\n* (For On Demand schedule only) Manually trigger[Ingestion of data](https://mongodb.com/docs/datalake/administration/ingest-data-on-demand/#std-label-ingest-on-demand) from your snapshot\n* [Set Up a Federated Database Instance for Your Dataset](https://mongodb.com/docs/datalake/tutorial/set-up-federated-database/#std-label-adl-create-federated-db) for the Data Lake dataset that is a snapshot of data in the `sample_mflix.movies` collection\n* [Connect to Your Federated Database Instance](https://mongodb.com/docs/datalake/tutorial/adl-connect-federated-db-instance/#std-label-adl-connect-federated-db-instance) to run the queries ## Procedure 1 ### Switch to `Database0` database: `| use Database0 |\n| ------------- | ` 2 ### Copy, paste, and run the following queries in your terminal. The following queries use the `sample_mflix.movies` collection for which you [created](https://mongodb.com/docs/datalake/tutorial/add-dataset-pipeline/#std-label-adl-add-pipeline) the pipeline.

[Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n* [Procedure](#procedure)\n* [Next Steps](#next-steps) This page guides you through the steps for connecting to the federated database instance to query your Data Lake dataset. ## Prerequisites Before you begin, you must have the following: * An IP address added to the access list of the project that contains the cluster. To learn more, see [Add Your Connection IP Address to Your IP Access List.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/add-ip-address-to-list/#std-label-gswa-access-list)\n* A database user for your cluster in the project that contains the Federated Database Instance that you want to connect to. To learn more, see [Create a Database User for Your Cluster.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/create-mongodb-user-for-cluster/#std-label-gswa-user)\n* A Federated Database Instance on the Atlas cluster mapped to your Atlas Data Lake dataset. To learn more, see [Set Up a Federated Database Instance for Your Dataset.](https://mongodb.com/docs/datalake/tutorial/set-up-federated-database/#std-label-adl-create-federated-db) ## Procedure 1 ### Navigate to Atlas Data Federation in the Atlas UI. To navigate to the Atlas Data Federation page: 1. Log in to [MongoDB Atlas.](https://cloud.mongodb.com)\n2. Select Data Federation under Data Services on the left-hand navigation. 2 ### Click Connect for the Federated Database Instance that you wish to connect to. ## Example If you are connecting to the Federated Database Instance for querying the Atlas Data Lake dataset that you created using the examples, click Connect for DataLake0. 3 ### Get the connection string for your preferred method of connecting. You can connect using [mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh), a [MongoDB Driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/), and [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/).

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Atlas Data Lake](https://mongodb.com/docs/datalake/) # Create an Atlas Data Lake Pipeline On this page * [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n* [Create a Pipeline from the Atlas UI](#create-a-pipeline-from-the-service-ui)\n* [Create a Pipeline from the API](#create-a-pipeline-from-the-api)\n* [Next steps](#next-steps) **Looking for documentation for what used to be called \"Atlas Data Lake\"?** Atlas Data Lake is now called Atlas Data Federation. To learn more about the renamed federated query engine service, see [Atlas Data Federation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/data-federation/). You can create Atlas Data Lake pipelines using the Atlas UI and Data Lake Pipelines API. This page guides you through the steps for creating an Atlas Data Lake pipeline. ## Prerequisites Before you begin, you must have the following: * [Backup-enabled](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/backup/cloud-backup/overview/#std-label-backup-cloud-provider) `M10` or higherAtlas cluster.\n* [Project Owner](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner) role for the project for which you want to deploy a Data Lake.\n* [Sample data](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/#std-label-sample-data) loaded on your cluster (if you wish to try the example in the following[Create a Pipeline from the Atlas UI](#std-label-adl-add-pipeline-steps)). ## Create a Pipeline from the Atlas UI 1 ### Navigate to Atlas Data Lake in the Atlas UI. To navigate to the Atlas Data Lake page: 1. Log in to [MongoDB Atlas.](https://cloud.mongodb.com)\n2. Select Data Lake under Deployment on the left-hand navigation panel. 2 ### Click Add Data Lake Pipeline. 3 ### Define the data source for the pipeline. You can create a copy of data on your Atlas cluster in MongoDB-managed cloud object storage optimized for analytic queries with workload isolation. To set up a pipeline, specify the following in theSetup Pipeline page: 1. Select the Atlas cluster from the dropdown.  \n## Example  \nIf you loaded the sample data on your cluster, select theAtlas cluster where you loaded the sample data.\n2.

By default, Atlas Data Lake automatically selects the region closest to your Atlas cluster for storing extracted data. 6 ### Specify fields in your collection to create partitions. Enter the most commonly queried fields from the collection in thePartition Attributes section. To specify nested fields, use the [dot notation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/document/#dot-notation). Do not include quotes (`\"\"`) around nested fields that you specify using [dot notation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/document/#dot-notation). You can't specify fields inside an array. The specified fields are used to partition your data. ## Warning You can't specify field names that contain periods (`.`) for partitioning. The most frequently queried fields should be listed towards the top because they will have a larger impact on performance and cost than fields listed lower down the list. The order of fields is important in the same way as it is for [Compound Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-compound/). Data is optimized for queries by the first field, followed by the second field, and so on. ## Example Enter `year` in the Most commonly queried fieldfield and `title` in the Second most commonly queried field field. Atlas Data Lake optimizes performance for the `year` field, followed by the `title` field. If you configure a Federated Database Instance for your Data Lake dataset, Atlas Data Federation optimizes performance for queries on the following fields: * the `year` field, and\n* the `year` field and the `title` field. Atlas Data Federation can also support a query on the `title` field only. However, in this case, Atlas Data Federation wouldn't be as efficient in supporting the query as it would be if the query were on the`title` field only. Performance is optimized in order; if a query omits a particular partition, Atlas Data Federation is less efficient in making use of any partitions that follow that. You can run Atlas Data Federation queries on fields not specified here, but Atlas Data Lake is less efficient in processing such queries. 7 ### (Optional) Specify fields inside your documents to exclude. By default, Atlas Data Lake extracts and stores all fields inside the documents in your collection. To specify fields to exclude: 1. Click Add Field.\n2. Enter field name in the Add Transformation Field Name window.  \n## Example  \n(Optional) Enter `fullplot` to exclude the field named`fullplot` in the `movies` collection.\n3. Click Done.\n4.

To learn more about the `pipelines` endpoint syntax and parameters for creating a pipeline, see[Create One Data Lake Pipeline.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#operation/createOneDataLakePipeline) ## Tip You can send a `GET` request to the [Data Lake](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#tag/Data-Lake-Pipelines) [availableSchedules](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#operation/returnAvailableSchedulesForPipeline) endpoint to retrieve the list of backup schedule policy items that you can use to create your Data Lake pipeline of type `PERIODIC_DPS`. ## Next steps Now that you've created your Data Lake pipeline, proceed to[Set Up a Federated Database Instance for Your

[Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n* [Procedure](#procedure)\n* [Next Steps](#next-steps) This page guides you through the steps for creating a federated database instance for you Data Lake dataset. ## Prerequisites Before you begin, you must have the following: * An Atlas Data Lake dataset in the same project where you intend to create the federated database instance.\n* [Project Owner](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner) role for the project where you want to create the federated database instance. ## Procedure 1 ### Navigate to Atlas Data Federation in the Atlas UI. To navigate to the Atlas Data Federation page: 1. Log in to [MongoDB Atlas.](https://cloud.mongodb.com)\n2. Select Data Federation under Data Services on the left-hand navigation. 2 ### Click Create Federated Database. 3 ### Select the configuration method. * For a guided experience, enable Visual Editor. (Default)\n* To edit the raw JSON, disable Visual Editor. 4 ### Create virtual databases, collections, and views and map them to your Data Lake dataset. Follow the steps in the tab below for your preferred Editor view in the UI. 5 ### Click Save to create the Federated Database Instance with virtual databases, collections, and views mapped to your Data Lake dataset. ## Next Steps Now that you've created a Federated Database Instance for your Data Lake dataset, proceed to [Connect to Your Federated Database

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Atlas Data Lake](https://mongodb.com/docs/datalake/) # Trigger Data Ingestion On Demand You can manually trigger an ingestion of snapshot data from theAtlas cluster to Atlas Data Lake datasets if you configured On Demand extraction in your Data Lake pipeline. You can trigger data ingestion from the Atlas UI and Data Lake Pipelines API. ## Trigger Data Ingestion from the Atlas UI 1 ### Log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com). 2 ### Select Data Lake under Deployment on the left-hand navigation. 3 ### Click the vertical ellipsis () for the Data Lake for which you configured On Demand ingestion and select Trigger an On Demand Pipeline Run. 4 ### Select the snapshot, from which to ingest data, from the dropdown. The dropdown shows a list of all the snapshots on your Atlascluster. However, you can select only the snapshots from which Data Lake hasn't yet ingested data; the grayed-out snapshots are snapshots from which your Data Lake has already ingested data. You can also send a `GET` request to the [Data Lake](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#tag/Data-Lake-Pipelines) `availableSnapshots` endpoint to retrieve the list of backup snapshots that you can use to trigger an on-demand pipeline run. To learn more about the API syntax and options for the `availableSnapshots` endpoint, see[Return Available Backup Snapshots for One Data Lake Pipeline.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#operation/returnAvailableSnapshotsForPipeline) 5 ### Click Confirm. Atlas displays a blue banner at the top of the page that shows the data ingestion status. ## Trigger Data Ingestion from the API To trigger data ingestion through the API, send a `POST` request to the [Data Lake](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#tag/Data-Lake-Pipelines) `trigger`endpoint with the name of the pipeline for which you want to trigger data ingestion.

Atlas UIand Data Lake Pipelines API. When you delete your Data Lake pipeline,Atlas deletes all underlying datasets, including the data, and removes the Data Lake datasets from your federated database instances where it's referenced. You can't undo this operation. ## Delete a Pipeline from the Atlas UI To delete a Data Lake pipeline: 1 ### Navigate to Atlas Data Lake in the Atlas UI. To navigate to the Atlas Data Lake page: 1. Log in to [MongoDB Atlas.](https://cloud.mongodb.com)\n2. Select Data Lake under Deploymenton the left-hand navigation. 2 ### Click  in the Actions column for the pipeline that you wish to delete. 3 ### Click Delete in the confirmation window. ## Delete a Pipeline from the API To delete a pipeline through the API, send a `DELETE` request to the [Data Lake](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#tag/Data-Lake-Pipelines) `pipelines`endpoint with the name of the pipeline that you want to delete. To learn more about the `pipelines` endpoint syntax and parameters for deleting a pipeline, see [Remove One Data Lake

Your Data Lake Pipeline](#pause-data-ingestion-for-your-data-lake-pipeline-1)\n* [Resume Data Ingestion for Your Data Lake Pipeline](#resume-data-ingestion-for-your-data-lake-pipeline) You can pause and resume ingestion of snapshot data from the Atlascluster to Atlas Data Lake datasets. You can't pause on-demand ingestion of snapshot data. ## Pause Data Ingestion for Your Data Lake Pipeline When you pause your Data Lake pipeline, Atlas doesn't ingest new datasets. You can continue to query previous snapshots from which data has been ingested. ### Pause Data Ingestion from the Atlas UI To pause a pipeline from the Atlas UI: 1 #### Navigate to Atlas Data Lake in the Atlas UI. To navigate to the Atlas Data Lake page: 1. Log in to [MongoDB Atlas.](https://cloud.mongodb.com)\n2. Select Data Lake under Deploymenton the left-hand navigation. 2 #### Click the pause button for the pipeline that you wish to pause. 3 #### Click Confirm in the Pause Ingestion confirmation window. When you pause your Data Lake pipeline, the Last Updatedcolumn for the pipeline in the Atlas UI shows the status for the pipeline as Paused. ### Pause Data Ingestion from the API To pause a pipeline through the API, send a `POST` request to the[Data Lake](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#tag/Data-Lake-Pipelines) `pause` endpoint with the name of the pipeline for which you want to pause the ingestion schedule. To learn more about the API syntax and parameters for the`pause` endpoint, see [Pause One Data Lake Pipeline.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#operation/pauseOnePipelineInOneProject) ## Resume Data Ingestion for Your Data Lake Pipeline When you resume data ingestion for a paused Atlas Data Lake pipeline,Atlas begins to take snapshots, which are then ingested in to your Data Lake datasets. ### Resume Data Ingestion from the Atlas UI To resume data ingestion from the Atlas UI: 1 #### Navigate to Atlas Data Lake in the Atlas UI.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Atlas Data Lake](https://mongodb.com/docs/datalake/) # Edit an Atlas Data Lake Pipeline On this page * [Edit a Pipeline from the Atlas UI](#edit-a-pipeline-from-the-service-ui)\n* [Edit a Pipeline from the API](#edit-a-pipeline-from-the-api) You can make changes to your Data Lake pipelines through the Atlas UI and Data Lake Pipelines API, including: * Edit the data extraction schedule\n* Edit the data storage region\n* Change the fields to exclude from your Data Lake datasets ## Edit a Pipeline from the Atlas UI 1 ### Log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com). 2 ### Select Data Lake under Deployment on the left-hand navigation. 3 ### Click  in the Actions column for the pipeline that you wish to modify. 4 ### (Optional) Make changes to your data extraction schedule. Before making changes to your Basic Schedule, ensure that your desired data extraction frequency is similar to your current backup schedule. For example, if you wish to switch to`Daily`, you must have a `Daily` backup schedule configured in your policy. Or, if you want to switch to a schedule of once a week, you must have a `Weekly` backup schedule configured in your policy. To learn more, see [Backup Scheduling](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/backup/cloud-backup/overview/#backup-scheduling--retention--and-on-demand-backup-snapshots). You can also send a `GET` request to the Data Lake[availableSchedules](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#operation/returnAvailableSchedulesForPipeline) endpoint to retrieve the list of backup schedule policy items that you can use to change the schedule of your Data Lake pipeline. 5 ### (Optional) Make changes to your data storage region. Atlas Data Lake provides optimized storage in the following AWS regions: | Data Lake Regions  | AWS Regions    |\n| ------------------ | -------------- |\n| Virginia, USA      | us-east-1      |\n| Oregon, USA        | us-west-2      |\n| Sao Paulo, Brazil  | sa-east-1      |\n| Ireland            | eu-west-1      |\n| London, England    | eu-west-2      |\n| Frankfurt, Germany | eu-central-1   |\n| Mumbai, India      | ap-south-1     |\n| Singapore          | ap-southeast-1 |\n| Sydney, Australia  | ap-southeast-2 | 6 ### Click Continue. 7 ### (Optional) Make changes to the fields excluded from your Data Lake datasets. * Click Add Field and specify Field Nameto add fields to the excluded fields list.\n* Click Delete All to remove all the fields from the excluded fields list.\n* Click  next to a field to remove that field from the excluded fields list. 8 ### Click Review Changes to review the changes to your pipeline. 9 ### Click Apply Changes for the changes to take effect. ## Edit a Pipeline from the API To edit a pipeline through the API, send a `PATCH` request to the[Data Lake](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#tag/Data-Lake-Pipelines) `pipelines` endpoint with the name of the pipeline that you want to edit. To learn more about the `pipelines` endpoint syntax and parameters for updating a pipeline, see [Update One Data Lake Pipeline.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#operation/updateOneDataLakePipeline) ## Tip You can send a `GET` request to the[availableSchedules](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/#operation/returnAvailableSchedulesForPipeline) endpoint to retrieve the list of backup schedule policy items
