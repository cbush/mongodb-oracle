into the MongoDB Query API](#translate-into-the-mongodb-query-api)\n* [Analyze Builders in Visual Studio](#analyze-builders-in-visual-studio)\n* [Simple Builder Expressions](#simple-builder-expressions)\n* [Track Builder Variables](#track-builder-variables)\n* [Fluent API](#fluent-api) ## Overview A **builder** is a class provided by the .NET driver to help you construct common operations like queries and updates. To learn more about builders, see[Operations with Builders](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/csharp/current/fundamentals/builders/) in the .NET driver documentation. ## Translate into the MongoDB Query API Use the MongoDB Analyzer to translate your builder expressions into the MongoDB Query API. Click the following tabs to see an example of a builder expression and its corresponding MongoDB Query API translation: ## Note ### Variable Names The MongoDB Query API translations generated by the MongoDB Analyzer contain variable names from your .NET driver code. The .NET driver replaces these variable names with their corresponding values when your application communicates with MongoDB. ## Analyze Builders in Visual Studio To analyze your builder expressions in Visual Studio, perform the following actions: 1. Install the MongoDB Analyzer as described in the [Install](https://mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-analyzer/current/install/#std-label-mongodb-analyzer-install)guide.\n2. Write a builder expression with the .NET driver\n3. Move your mouse over the ... annotation beneath the first method of your builder expression to display an information message that contains the MongoDB Query API translation. ### Simple Builder Expressions Click on the following corresponding tab to see a builder expression with or without an information message displayed: ### Track Builder Variables The MongoDB Analyzer supports builder variable tracking and composition. You can combine multiple builder expressions with [logical operators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/boolean-logical-operators)and view the MongoDB Query API translation in the information message. Click on the following corresponding tab to see a composed builder variable with or without an information message displayed: ### Fluent API The MongoDB Analyzer supports the Fluent API using builder classes in the .NET driver.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Analyzer](https://mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-analyzer/current/) # Analyze LINQ Expressions On this page * [Overview](#overview)\n* [Translate into the MongoDB Query API](#translate-into-the-mongodb-query-api)\n* [Analyze LINQ in Visual Studio](#analyze-linq-in-visual-studio)\n* [Simple LINQ Expressions](#simple-linq-expressions)\n* [Unsupported LINQ Expressions](#unsupported-linq-expressions)\n* [Analyze LINQ3](#analyze-linq3) ## Overview **LINQ** is a query syntax included in the C# language. The .NET driver can translate a subset of LINQ expressions into MongoDB aggregation pipelines. To learn more about LINQ, see the following resources: * [LINQ](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/csharp/current/fundamentals/linq/) in the .NET driver documentation\n* [LINQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/)in the Microsoft C# guide To learn more about aggregation pipelines, see[Aggregation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/) in the MongoDB manual. ## Note ### Runtime Differences Although the MongoDB Query API translations generated by the MongoDB Analyzer have the same[query shape](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/glossary/#std-term-query-shape)as your runtime .NET driver queries, there may be slight differences due to the following factors: * Your Serialization Settings\n* Your LINQ Settings The difference between the translations the MongoDB Analyzer generates and your queries at runtime should not impact your ability to analyze and debug your code. To learn more about serialization and LINQ settings, see the[FAQ](https://mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-analyzer/current/faq/#std-label-mongodb-analyzer-faq-custom-serialization)page. Use the MongoDB Analyzer to learn the following about your LINQ expressions: * How your LINQ expressions translate into the MongoDB Query API\n* If any of your LINQ expressions are not supported ## Translate into the MongoDB Query API Click the following tabs to see an example of a LINQ expression and its corresponding MongoDB Query API translation: ## Note ### Variable Names The MongoDB Query API translations generated by the MongoDB Analyzer contain variable names from your .NET driver code. The .NET driver replaces these variable names with their corresponding values when your application communicates with MongoDB. ## Analyze LINQ in Visual Studio To analyze your LINQ expressions in Visual Studio, perform the following actions: 1.

### Analyze LINQ3 To analyze a LINQ3 expression, you must configure the MongoDB Analyzer to use the LINQ3 provider. To learn how to configure your LINQ provider, see the[configuration](https://mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-analyzer/current/configuration/#std-label-mongodb-analyzer-configuration) guide. ## Important ### Expressions Supported Only by LINQ3 If your .NET driver version supports LINQ3 but you configure your MongoDB Analyzer to use the default LINQ provider (LINQ2), the MongoDB Analyzer informs you if your LINQ expression is supported by LINQ3 but not LINQ2. Click the tabs to see a LINQ expression supported by LINQ3 but not LINQ2 and the corresponding warning output by the MongoDB Analyzer: To view examples of expressions the .NET driver only supports with the LINQ3 provider, see the[MongoDB Analyzer Github repository.](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-analyzer/blob/main/tests/MongoDB.Analyzer.Tests.Common.TestCases/Linq/NotSupportedLinq2.cs) ← [Analyze Builders
