[Convert Field Data Types](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/convert-field-data-types/#std-label-convert-field-data-types) Convert the data type of the fields in your collection to a different type. For example, convert numbers stored as strings to the number data type. [Add a Lookup Field](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/add-lookup-field/#std-label-add-lookup-field) Use [$lookup](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/) functionality to add a field based on a query across multiple data sources. [Run Aggregation Pipelines on Your Data](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/aggregation-pipeline/#std-label-charts-agg-pipeline) Transform your collection's documents with an aggregation pipeline. [Save and Reuse Queries](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/query-library/) Save and reuse your aggregation pipeline queries. ← [Visualize Embedded Objects and

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Launch MongoDB Charts On this page * [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n* [Procedure](#procedure)\n* [Moving Forward](#moving-forward)\n* [Delete Your MongoDB Charts Instance](#delete-your-mongodb-charts-instance) The following tutorial guides you through launching Charts on MongoDB Cloud. You can access Charts with any[Organization Role](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#organization-roles). In Atlas, click Charts in the navigation bar. ## Prerequisites MongoDB Charts is accessible through MongoDB Atlas. You will need a[MongoDB Atlas user account](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/manage-users/)to complete this tutorial. To learn more about creating an Atlasuser, see the Atlas [Getting Started](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/)documentation. You will also need an Atlas cluster to visualize data usingCharts. The steps on this page guide you through creating anAtlas cluster. ## Note Each instance of the MongoDB Charts application is tied to a singleAtlas [project](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/manage-projects/), and can only visualize data from Atlas clusters within the same project. ### Required Access This tutorial requires that your [Atlas user](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/manage-users/) have the appropriate permissions to read data from the clusters in your Atlas project. This means that yourAtlas user must have any [Project Role](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#project-roles) except `Project Read Only`, which does not grant the appropriate permissions. When you first register an Atlas account, you are granted the `Project Owner` role on your initial project. For information on configuring additional users and roles, see[Atlas Access](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/manage-users/) in theAtlas documentation. ## Procedure 1 ### Log into MongoDB Atlas. To access the MongoDB Charts application, you must be logged into[Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com). 2 ### Select your desired Atlas project, or create a new project. If you have an Atlas [project](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/manage-projects/)with clusters containing data you wish to visualize, select the project from the Context dropdown in the left navigation pane. If you do not have a suitable existing Atlas project, see[Create a Project](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/manage-projects/#create-a-project)in the Atlas documentation for instructions on creating a new project. 3 ### (_Optional_) Invite people to your Atlas project and shared Charts instance. All Atlas [project users](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/manage-users/#manage-project-users-and-teams)with [Project Roles](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#project-roles)other than `Project Read Only`have access to the Charts instance associated with that project. To add additional members to your Atlasproject, see [Manage Project Users and Teams](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/manage-users/#manage-project-users-and-teams)in the Atlas documentation. 4 ### (_Optional_) Create an Atlas cluster. The MongoDB Charts application makes it easy to connect collections in your cluster as [data sources](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/data-sources/). Data sources reference specific collections and[charts views](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/create-manage-charts-view/#std-label-charts-views) that you can access in the[Chart Builder](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/) to visualize the data in those collections or charts views. ## Note You can skip this step if you already have an Atlas cluster in the current

## Note For complete instructions on creating an Atlas cluster and details on all available configuration options, see[Create a Cluster](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/create-new-cluster/)in the Atlas documentation. 5 ### Launch the MongoDB Charts application. In Atlas, click Charts in the navigation bar. ## Note When you first launch MongoDB Charts in a project, Chartsautomatically creates new[MongoDB users](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-add-mongodb-users/) in yourAtlas project to access your cluster data. The names of these users are in the format:`mongodb-stitch-charts-<PROJECT-NAME>-<ID>_<CLUSTER-NAME>` To navigate back to the Atlas Clusters view, clickData Services at the top of the MongoDB Charts application. ## Moving Forward Now that you have a data source, you are ready to begin visualizing your data. The next steps are to[create a dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/), and then[build charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/) to populate your dashboard. For complete walkthroughs of MongoDB Charts and its features, including downloadable data sets to visualize, see the following[Tutorials.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/tutorials/) ## Delete Your MongoDB Charts Instance ## Important Deleting a MongoDB Charts instance deletes all data associated with that instance including dashboards, data sources, and metadata. Once the MongoDB Charts instance is deleted, this data cannot be recovered. If you are an Atlas [Project Owner](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner), you can deactivate and delete a MongoDB Charts instance linked to your Atlas project from your Atlas [Project Settings.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/manage-project-settings/) If you delete your linked MongoDB Charts instance, you can create a newMongoDB Charts instance for your project at any time.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Run Aggregation Pipelines on Your Data On this page * [Example](#example)\n* [Address Aggregation Pipeline Errors](#address-aggregation-pipeline-errors)\n* [Limitations](#limitations) [Aggregation pipelines](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/) transform your documents into an aggregated set of results. In MongoDB Charts, aggregation pipelines are commonly used to visualize new fields created from calculated results of pre-existing fields, but also have many other applications. To create an aggregation pipeline: 1. In the Query bar, input an aggregation pipeline. Your pipeline must be in square brackets.\n2. (Optional) Select Format to arrange the query as follows:  \n   * Split the query across multiple lines  \n   * Indent the query as per JSON conventions\n3. (Conditional) If you selected the Format option, clickClose when you finish.\n4. Click Apply to execute your pipeline. ## Example The following chart shows total sale amounts from an office supply company, categorized by store location.

![Example Aggregation Pipeline](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/query-bar-agg-example.png) Once the data has been processed using the pipeline, the chart displays the Sum of all`saleAmounts` categorized by store location. ## Address Aggregation Pipeline Errors If your aggregation is invalid, Charts displays the icon in the Query bar. Click the Query bar if it is not already displayed to view error details. Charts displays error details for: * Client-side errors, such as malformed JSON, and\n* Server-side errors, such as invalid MQL or unsupported pipeline stages. ![Example Aggregation Pipeline Error](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/agg-pipeline-error.png) Review the error details, then adjust your aggregation pipeline accordingly. ## Limitations * Charts doesn't support the [$lookup](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-lookup) operator in aggregation queries. However, you can use this operator in Data Source pipelines. To learn more about how to use pipelines to pre-process data before it reaches the Chart Builder, see [Create and Manage Charts Views.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/create-manage-charts-view/#std-label-data-sources-pipeline)\n* Charts supports the [$function](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/function/#mongodb-expression-exp.-function) operator only when you define the function body in a single line and wrap it in double quotes. To use this operator in your aggregation queries, you must use the following syntax:  \n```javascript  \n{  \n  $function: {  \n    body: \"function(arg1, arg2, ...) { ... }\",  \n    args: <array

Source](#edit-a-chart-s-data-source)\n* [Try Out Charts with the Sample Data Source](#try-out-charts-short-with-the-sample-data-source) A data source in MongoDB Charts references one of the following: * A [collection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/databases-and-collections/#std-label-collections) or database[view](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/views/) in your MongoDB deployment.\n* A [charts view](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/create-manage-charts-view/#std-label-data-sources-pipeline) that you create using a collection. You can use the fields in the data source to construct a chart. When you build a chart, you must specify the data source that the chart uses. Deployments in MongoDB Charts reference Atlas deployments that contain valid Charts data sources, including: * All [clusters and serverless instances](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlascreate-database-deployment/) in your Atlasproject for which you have the[Project Data Access Read Only](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Data-Access-Read-Only) role or higher.\n* All [federated database instances](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/data-federation/) in your project, including[Online Archives.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/online-archive/manage-online-archive/) ## Connect or Disconnect Data Sources and Deployments An Atlas [Project Owner](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner) can connect or disconnect data sources and deployments. To learn more, see[Connect or Disconnect Data Sources and Deployments.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/connect-disconnect-data-source/#std-label-connect-disconnect-data-source) ## Note Charts connects to all deployments and data sources in your project by default. ## Manage Data Sources To manage settings for a data source, see[Manage Data Sources](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-data-sources/#std-label-manage-existing-data-sources). To manage pipelines, see [Create and Manage Charts Views.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/create-manage-charts-view/#std-label-data-sources-pipeline) ## Note To apply a pipeline, use a charts view. You can't apply pipelines to an entire collection. ## Manage Deployments To manage settings for the Atlas deployments that contain your data sources, see [Manage Deployments.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-deployment/#std-label-manage-deployment) ## Edit a Chart's Data Source To edit the data source for an existing chart: 1 ### Select your dashboard. From the Dashboards page, select the dashboard that contains the chart. 2 ### Click Edit on the chart you want to edit. 3 ### Click the button under Data Source on the top left of the chart builder. The button says Select if you have not selected a data source, or it says the name of the currently selected data source. 4 ### Click the Project tab. All of your connected deployments appear. ## Note A deployment and its data sources won't display on theSelect Data Sourcemodal unless they are connected to Charts. Only a[Project Owner](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner) can [connect or disconnect](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/connect-disconnect-data-source/#std-label-connect-disconnect-data-source) deployments and data sources.

3 ### Check the connection status and connect the deployment. If the deployment connection status is Connected, the deployment is already connected to Charts. TheData Access section displays all of the collections within the selected Atlas deployment. If the deployment connection status is Disconnected: 1. Click the connect icon  next to the deployment connection status.\n2. Click Reconnect on the modal that appears. The deployment connects and the Data Access section displays all of the databases for the selected Atlasdeployment. You can manage the following deployment settings. ## Connect or Disconnect the Deployment or Data Sources An Atlas [Project Owner](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner) can connect the deployment or its data sources. To learn more, see[Connect or Disconnect Data Sources and Deployments.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/connect-disconnect-data-source/#std-label-connect-disconnect-data-source) ## Note Charts connects to all deployments and data sources in your project by default. To manage other data source settings, see [Manage Data Sources.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-data-sources/#std-label-manage-existing-data-sources) ## Enable Organization-Wide Sharing for a Deployment Organization-wide sharing grants users in your organization, including users who are not members of your project, permission to view data in a deployment that is used for dashboards shared with your organization. You can enable organization-wide sharing[for an entire deployment](#std-label-org-sharing-deployment) or[for a specific data source.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-data-sources/#std-label-org-sharing-data-source) ## Important If you enable organization-wide sharing for a deployment, it applies to all existing data sources and to any new data source you add to that deployment in the future. To enable organization-wide sharing for a deployment: 1 ### In the left navigation menu, click Data Sources. The Data Sources page displays. 2 ### In the Deployment dropdown, select the deployment that contains your data source. Deployments in MongoDB Charts reference Atlas deployments that contain valid Charts data sources, including: * All [clusters and serverless

In the Organization subsection of theData Access section, toggleAll users in the organization can view data in this data source to ON. ## Deployment Read Preference Each [deployment](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/data-sources/#std-label-deployments) has a read preference, which determines the [replica set member](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/replica-set-members/)that the data source reads data from. By default, a newly-added Atlas cluster has a read preference of Secondary, which means that it reads from a[secondary node](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/replica-set-secondary/)within the Atlas cluster. You can change the read preference of a cluster using the Read preference dropdown. You can't change the read preference of a federated database instance. Federated database instances have a read preference of Nearest by default, which means that they read from the replica set member whose network latency falls within the acceptable latency window.

After you select a category of sample data, Chartscreates a new Sample Dashboard of which you are the`Owner`. You can also create a Sample Dashboard by going through the Charts [Welcome Experience.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/welcome-experience/#std-label-welcome-experience) ### Sample Dashboard Filters Sample dashboards come with preset example dashboard filters. You can adjust these filters to modify the data that appears on your dashboard. To learn more about filtering dashboard data, see[Filter Dashboards by Field Values.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-filtering/#std-label-dashboard-filtering) ## Refresh Dashboard Data MongoDB Charts automatically refreshes chart data once it becomes out of date with the backing data source. You can also manually refresh dashboard data at any time. To learn how to configure refresh settings and underlying refresh behavior, see [Refresh Dashboard Data.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-refresh/) ## Get Chart Data The data underlying a chart can be exported as a table. All viewers of public dashboards and authenticated users of non-public dashboards can view and export data. To view the chart data, click Get Chart Data from the  menu. Each row in the table represents a data point. ## Important ### Data Table Differs from Chart Visualization Some configuration options you see reflected on a chart visualization are not applied to the data table. TheChart Data table displays underlying data retrieved with your full aggregation pipeline, and not all Chart Builder configuration options apply aggregation stages. Review your data to verify its contents. If you want to analyze your underlying data with a third-party tool, you can download your data from the Chart Data modal. To download your data, click Download - CSV orDownload - JSON. ## Note You can also retrieve chart data using the[Embedding SDK](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedding-charts-sdk/) `getData()` method. To learn more about SDK API methods, see the[Embedding SDK Reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mongodb-js/charts-embed-dom). ![Viewing chart data will display a table of the values used to create a chart.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Save and Reuse Queries The Query Library allows you to reuse a query across multiple charts. If you save a query to the library, any user on your charts project can apply the same query on their own charts. Any changes to a query stored in the library impact all charts thar are connected to that query. ## Save Aggregation Pipeline Queries After you apply an aggregation pipeline query to a chart, you can save it to the Query Library. This makes the query available for use on other charts created by you and other users on the same charts project. To save a query: 1 ### In the Query bar for a chart, input a [find()](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/) query or an aggregation pipeline and click Apply. To learn more, see [Run Aggregation Pipelines on Your Data](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/aggregation-pipeline/#std-label-charts-agg-pipeline) and [Filter Your Data Using the Query Bar.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-query-bar) 2 ### Click the Library dropdown next to the Query bar. The Query Library menu contains options for saving and loading queries. 3 ### Choose Save Query to display the confirmation window. 4 ### Enter a name for your query. The Query title field shows the names of each existing query and the number of charts that use the query. You can enter a new name for your query or select an eisting query name to overwrite the existing query with your new query. If you enter a new name, you must also click Create <your-query-title> to create a named query in the library. If you select an existing query from the list, the field is pre-populated with the selected query name. If you save an existing query, all charts connected to that query will inherit the new query text. 5 ### Click Save to save the query to the query library. ## Load Saved Queries To use a previously saved query from the Query Library on a chart, use the Library dropdown to load the saved query. You can access queries saved by any user in the project. To load saved queries: 1 ### Create a new chart, or click the Edit button for the chart. 2 ### Click the Library dropdown next to the query bar. The Query Library menu contains options for loading and saving queries. 3 ### Choose Load Query from the dropdown to display the Load Query pane. 4 ### Choose the saved query to run against your data. By default, the current data source is selected. It contains the list of queries applied to charts using the current data source only. You can choose Any data source to select from all saved queries in the library. 5 ### Browse the list of saved queries. In the Load Query pane, the queries are listed in alphabetical order and are case insensitive. For each query, you can see the name of the query, the start of the query, and the number of charts that use the query. Also, you can do the following: * Hover over the tooltip icon to see the query owner and when the query was last modified.\n* Click x to close the library pane. To learn more about all other actions that you can perform on the saved queries, see [Manage Saved Queries.](#std-label-charts-query-library-manage) 6 ### Click Load for the query you wish to load in the query bar. After loading a query, you can run the query against the data in the chart. Also, you can modify or disconnect the query from the library. To learn more, see [Modify or Disconnect Saved Queries.](#std-label-charts-query-library-modify-disconnect) ## Modify or Disconnect Saved Queries After you [load a saved query](#std-label-charts-query-library-load), you can modify or disconnect the query from the library. **To modify**, make changes to the query in the query bar and save the query under its original name, only if you created the query or have the [Project Owner](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner) role, or save the query under a new name.

Provider](#configure-charts-short-to-use-your-custom-atlas-app-services-provider)\n* [Create a Web App to Display Your Chart](#create-a-web-app-to-display-your-chart)\n* [Customize the Node.js App](#customize-the-node.js-app) [Atlas App Services](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/) is a serverless platform that enables developers to quickly build applications without having to set up server infrastructure. App Services offers several authentication options, including [Google OAuth](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2), [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/), and email/password. You can use the authentication mechanism from an app service to control data access for an embedded chart. This tutorial shows you how to: * Enable authenticated embedding for a chart.\n* Use the Embedding SDK to embed a chart authenticated by a custom[Atlas App Services](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/) provider.\n* Use your app service to control the data in your embedded chart. ## Note This tutorial does not cover creating an app service with authentication. See the [Atlas App Services documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/tutorials/) for app creation tutorials. ## Prerequisites * You must be an Atlas [Project Owner](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#project-roles) to configure embedding authentication providers for your linkedCharts instance.\n* You must have a chart which uses your app's backing database as its [data source](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/data-sources/#std-label-data-sources). For more information about creating a chart, see [Build Charts.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/#std-label-build-charts) ## Procedures ### Enable Authenticated Embedding for a Chart Enable authenticated embedding to generate a Charts Base URL and a chart ID. You will need your Charts Base URL and chart ID to display your chart on a web page. 1 #### Select a dashboard. From your dashboard page, select the dashboard containing the chart you wish to embed. 2 #### Select a chart. From the dashboard, click  at the top-right of the chart to access its embedding information. SelectEmbed chart from the dropdown menu. ## Note If a chart is on a dashboard that has embedding enabled, theEmbed Chart option is automatically enabled. Therefore, you can't select the Embed chart option for charts within dashboards that have embedding enabled. 3 #### Enable external sharing on the data source If you have already enabled external sharing on the data source this chart uses, skip this step. If you haven't yet enabled embedding on the data source, you can do so now. Click theConfigure external sharing link. 4 #### Select the Authenticated tab in the dialog window. ![Embed authenticated chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/embed-chart-authenticated.png) 5 #### Toggle Enable authenticated access to On. 6 #### (_Optional_) Specify a filter function to inject per user. You can specify a function to inject a MongoDB filter document for each user who views the chart. This is useful for rendering user-specific charts. ## Example The following filter function only renders data where the`ownerId` field of a document matches the value of the Embedding Authentication Provider's token's `sub` field: `| function getFilter(context) {          |\n| -------------------------------------- |\n| return { ownerId: context.token.sub }; |\n| }

7 #### (_Optional_) Specify filterable fields for your chart. Specify the fields on which chart viewers can filter data. By default, no fields are specified, meaning the chart cannot be filtered until you explicitly allow at least one field. ## Tip ### See also:  To learn more about filterable fields, see[Specify Filterable Fields.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-embedded-charts/#std-label-specify-filter-fields) 8 #### Copy the Chart Base URL and Chart ID Use these values in your application code together with your Embedded Authentication Provider attributes to embed your chart. ### Configure Charts to use your Custom Atlas App Services Provider 1 #### Go to the Authentication Settings view. 1. If Charts is not already displayed, clickCharts in the navigation bar.\n2. Click Embedding in the sidebar.\n3. Click the Authentication Settings tab. 2 #### From the Authentication providers section, click Add. 3 #### In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for the provider. 4 #### From the Provider list, select Atlas App Services. 5 #### From the Atlas Project list, select the Cloud project that contains your app service. 6 #### From the App ID list, select the app service to use for authentication. 7 #### Set toggle switch for using Atlas App Services rules for data access. In addition to authenticating users for embedded chart access, you can perform fine-grained data access control with your app service [service rules](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/services/define-a-service-rule/). Set the toggle switch toOn if you want to enable rule enforcement. When this option is enabled, any App Services rules defined on collections will be observed by Charts when retrieving chart data. You can use this feature to restrict access to the data shown on your chart, including showing different subsets of data to different users, depending on their[role.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/mongodb/define-roles-and-permissions/) ## Note * This option assumes that the [data source](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/data-sources/#std-label-data-sources) for this chart uses the same MongoDB database and collection as your app service.\n* Using this option may have a performance impact, so you should leave it off if you do not need to restrict data access based on App Services rules. 8 #### Enter service name. Enter the name of the service that fetches data from MongoDB. To find the name of your data service: 1. Navigate to your app service.\n2. Click Clusters in the sidebar navigation.\n3. The service name is listed under App Service Name. 9 #### Click the Save button. ## Create a Web App to Display Your Chart If you already have an app in which to display your chart, you're ready to add an [embedded chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedding-charts-sdk/#std-label-embedding-charts-sdk). If not, proceed with the remaining steps to create a new app. MongoDB offers a pre-built example app that shows how to use the Embedding SDK to display an embedded chart using App Services authentication. Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com//mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/charts/authenticated-realm) and follow the instructions in the `Readme` file to begin using the app. You can run the app as-is, or you can customize it to use the chart you created earlier. ## Note The example app assumes that your app service uses email/password authentication. If your app service uses another authentication mechanism, the example app will require additional customization. ### Customize the Node.js App All the lines you need to edit are marked with a comment containing`~REPLACE~`. 1 #### Open the file `index.js` in a text editor. The file `index.js` is located in the `src` directory. 2 #### Enter your App ID Replace the existing App ID with your App ID, which you can find on the left side of your app service UI. ```javascript

session.`getRealmUserToken()` must be imported from the Embedding SDK, as you can see in the `import` statement on line 2 of the example app: ```javascript import ChartsEmbedSDK, { getRealmUserToken } from \"@mongodb-js/charts-embed-dom\"; \n``` You can also include the Embedding SDK with inline Javascript in an HTML page, as shown in the following code snippet: ```javascript <script src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/js/bundles/4.6.0/stitch.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@mongodb-js/charts-embed-dom\"></script> \n``` To use the `getRealmUserToken()` function in this scenario, import it from the SDK: ```javascript ChartsEmbedSDK.getRealmUserToken() \n``` 4 #### Enter your chart ID Replace the existing chart ID with the ID of the chart you want to display. Your chart ID is visible in the embedding options modal window. See[Embedding SDK](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedding-charts-sdk/) for detailed instructions on enabling embedding for a chart. ```javascript const chart = sdk.createChart({   chartId: \"a2e775e6-f267-4c2c-a65d-fbf3fad4a4f2\", // Optional: ~REPLACE~ with your Chart ID }); \n``` After you finish customizing the app, it's ready to run. ← [Embed a Chart Authenticated with Google

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Subset Mode You can enable Subset Mode in MongoDB Charts to restrict the input collection to `1000` randomly selected documents. To toggleSubset Mode, use the toggle in the Previewsection. The Subset Mode setting for a chart doesn't persist when the chart renders on a dashboard. So, if you enable subset mode when you build a chart, the data that renders in the dashboard isn't sampled. ## Note When you enable subset mode and you specify a [filter](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-charts-filter-documents), MongoDB Charts takes the sample of `1000`documents _before_ it applies the filter. So, MongoDB Charts might use fewer than `1000` documents to plot the chart. ## Use Case Consider using Subset Mode when you draft a chart and heavily modify chart options. In this situation,Subset Mode lets the chart render quickly during the building process. When you feel satisfied with your chart, save it as soon as possible. ## Note Due to the random nature of sampling, when you haveSubset Mode enabled, your visualizations might change each time the

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Calculate New Data Fields On this page * [Considerations](#considerations)\n* [Create a Calculated Field](#create-a-calculated-field)\n* [Edit a Calculated Field](#edit-a-calculated-field)\n* [Remove a Calculated Field](#remove-a-calculated-field) You can combine data from one or more fields in your collection into a single calculated field. For example, you can: * Convert a field in hours to seconds or in degrees Farenheit to Celsius\n* Multiply a price field by a quantity field to create a total\n* Combine multiple line items within an array to calculate a total ## Considerations * You can only create calculated fields from data within the same document.\n* You can't [convert the type](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/convert-field-data-types/#std-label-convert-field-data-types) of a calculated field through the MongoDB Charts interface. However, you can use[Type Expression Operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/meta/aggregation-quick-reference/#type-expression-operators) in a calculated field's definition.\n* Once you create a calculated field, you can [modify](#std-label-edit-calculated-field) its definition but not its name. However, you can [remove](#std-label-remove-calculated-field) and recreate the field if you need to rename it. ## Create a Calculated Field You create a calculated field by combining the data of existing fields through simple expressions or MQL [Operator Expressions.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/meta/aggregation-quick-reference/#std-label-agg-quick-ref-operator-expressions) ## Note The definition of a calculated field can contain either simple expression language or operator expression language. You can't use both simple and operator expression language in the same definition. To create a calculated field: 1. In the corner of the Fields pane, clickAdd Field.\n2. Select Calculated.\n3. Enter the Field Name of the calculated field you want to define. You can specify a nested field by using dot notation. For example, `metadata.target`.\n4. Enter the Value Expression using [simple expression](#std-label-calc-field-simple) language or[Operator Expressions.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/meta/aggregation-quick-reference/#std-label-agg-quick-ref-operator-expressions)\n5. Click Save Field.

\n``` ### Operator Expressions You can use [Operator Expressions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/meta/aggregation-quick-reference/#std-label-agg-quick-ref-operator-expressions) to define more complex calculated fields. ## Example The following examples are valid operator expressions to define a calculated field. Multiply the `price` field by `0.075`: ``` { $multiply: [ \"$price\", 0.075 ] } \n``` Combine multiple line items fields in an array to calculate a total: ``` { $reduce: {   input: '$items', initialValue: 0,   in: { $sum : [\"$$value\",     { $multiply: [\"$$this.price\",       \"$$this.quantity\"] }   ] } } } \n``` ## Tip You can use a calculated field in the definition of another calculated field. For example, if you create a `salesTax` calculated field with the following definition: ``` { $multiply: [ \"$price\", 0.075 ] } \n``` You can then create a `totalCost` calculated field that uses the`salesTax` field in its definition: ``` { $sum: [\"$price\", \"$salesTax\"] } \n``` ### Literal Strings You can set a calculated field's value to a string using the `$literal`operator. ## Example The following field definition assigns a value of `my string`: ``` { $literal: \"my string\" } \n``` ## Edit a Calculated Field You can modify the definition of a calculated field. 1. In the Fields pane, click the Ellipsis (...)next to the name of the calculated field you want to modify.\n2. Select Modify field.\n3. Update the Value Expression.\n4. Click Save Field. If you are using the calculated field in a chart, the chart refreshes to reflect the new calculated field definition. ![Click the ellipsis next to the field name, then click \"Modify field\".](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/calculated-field-modify.png) ## Remove a Calculated Field When you remove a calculated field, MongoDB Charts resamples the data source, updates the Fields pane, and refreshes your chart. If the calculated field was used in encodings or filters, it remains in the chart even after the field is removed from the Fields pane. To remove a calculated field: 1.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Visualize Embedded Objects and Arrays On this page * [Embedded Objects](#embedded-objects)\n* [Array Fields](#array-fields) MongoDB Charts can visualize fields from rich data structures. You can directly access fields in embedded objects and flexibly process array fields according to your use case. ## Embedded Objects Embedded objects in the Fields section of the Chart Builder are indicated by curly brackets (`{}`) next to their name. To expand an object field, click the arrow to the left of the field name. You can drag embedded object fields onto the desired[encoding channels](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels) just like any other field to visualize those fields in your chart. ## Example The `video.movieDetails` data source in the following example contains embedded objects named `awards` and `imdb`. We expand the objects by clicking the arrows to the left of their names, then in the bar chart we compare the mean `imdb.rating` in the Y-axis with`awards.wins` in the X-axis. ![Create chart embedded object](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/charts-nested-obj-3.png) ## Note Notice the filter provided above the chart of`{'awards.wins': {$gt: 0}}`, meaning only movies which have won at least one award are included in the visualization. For more information on filtering documents in MongoDB Charts, see the[Filter Documents](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-charts-filter-documents) page. ## Array Fields Array fields in the Fields section of the Chart Builder page are indicated by square brackets (`[]`) next to their name.

### Numeric Accumulates You can apply these accumulates to arrays of Numeric values: | Accumulate | Description                                  |\n| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| min        | Returns the minimum value in the array.      |\n| max        | Returns the maximum value in the array.      |\n| mean       | Returns the mean of all values in the array. |\n| sum        | Returns the sum of all values in the array.  | ## Note MongoDB Charts only displays accumulate options which match the data type of the field used in the visualization (i.e., only showing string accumulate options for string data and numeric accumulate options for numeric data). ### Fields within an Array As with array-valued fields, [encoding channels](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels) require an array reduction option to be specified when handling fields _within_ an array. In this case, the selected reduction is applied to the array containing the target field. Additionally, in the case of embedded arrays, you must select a reduction option for the top-level array and all sub-arrays.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Embed Charts with the Embedding SDK You can embed a chart into a web application with the [Embedding SDK](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedding-charts-sdk/#std-label-embedding-charts-sdk), which allows you to make more flexible adjustments to chart settings and rendering. You can use the embedding SDK to do the following tasks: * Add filters dynamically\n* Change the size and style of the chart\n* Refresh on demand\n* Programmatically save charts as an image To embed a chart with the SDK, you need to: 1. Enable embedding for the chart.\n2. Allow [embedded chart filtering](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-embedded-charts/#std-label-embed-options-filter) on certain fields by [specifying filterable fields](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-embedded-charts/#std-label-specify-filter-fields). Don't include fields that may reveal sensitive data.\n3. Have the chart ID and base URL strings.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Embedding SDK On this page * [Install the Embedding SDK](#install-the-embedding-sdk)\n* [Examples](#examples) You can embed a chart or dashboard into a web application with the Embedding SDK, allowing more flexible adjustments of settings and rendering. To learn more, see [Get Started with the Embedding SDK.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/get-started-embedding-sdk/#std-label-get-started-embedding-sdk) ## Install the Embedding SDK If you have a simple web app, you can reference the Embedding SDK from a script tag, and no installation is needed. You can use the UMD to run `@mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk`directly in the browser. `| <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@mongodb-js/charts-embed-dom\"></script> |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ` If you are building a more complex web app and are using `npm` or`yarn`, you can install the Embedding SDK so that it can be used directly from your script files. To install the embedding SDK with `npm`, use the following command: ``` npm install @mongodb-js/charts-embed-dom \n``` To install with `yarn`: ``` yarn add @mongodb-js/charts-embed-dom \n``` ## Examples An [example app](https://codesandbox.io/s/charts-embedding-sdk-8i898) using the embedding SDK can be found at `codesandbox.io`. The example app demonstrates some of the interactive features available to the embedding SDK, including an interactive filter and a manual refresh button.

For each type conversion you select, you can find the underlying aggregation stage by[viewing your aggregation pipeline.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/view-export-chart-data/#std-label-view-aggregation-pipeline) To see the effects of your conversion on a sample document,[view a sample source document.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/view-export-chart-data/#std-label-view-source-documents) Your conversions are saved with your chart definition. ## Convert Data Types in an Array You can convert arrays of primitive data and fields of primitive data from arrays of documents. Each item in the array is converted to the new type. However, if the conversion is invalid or if the original value of the item is `null`, the item converts to `null`. You cannot convert arrays nested more than one level deep. ## Example You have an array of strings: `| [\"1\", \"fish\", \"42\"] |\n| ------------------- | ` Applying the Number data type conversion returns the following array: ```javascript [1, null, 45] \n``` ## Example You have an array of documents with fields `foo` and `bar`: ```javascript [{foo: \"1\", bar: \"2\"}, {foo: \"fish\", bar: \"tacos\"}, {foo: \"45\", bar: \"46\"}] \n``` Applying the Number data type conversion to the `foo`field returns the following array of documents: ```javascript [{foo: 1, bar: \"2\"}, {foo: null, bar:

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Embed an Authenticated Chart using a Custom JWT Provider On this page * [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n* [Procedures](#procedures)\n* [Enable Authenticated Embedding for a Chart](#enable-authenticated-embedding-for-a-chart)\n* [Configure Charts to use your Custom JWT Provider](#configure-charts-short-to-use-your-custom-jwt-provider)\n* [Create a Web App to Display your Chart](#create-a-web-app-to-display-your-chart)\n* [Customize the Node.js App](#customize-the-node.js-app) Many websites use authentication systems that generate JWTs to represent a signed-in user. If your website produces JWTs, you can configure Charts to validate the existing tokens to authorize the rendering of embedded charts. Alternatively, if your site does not already use JWTs as a part of the authentication process, you can write code to generate JWTs explicitly for the purpose of authorizing chart renders. This tutorial shows the latter approach. The example shows you how to generate a simple JWT for a logged in user and send it toCharts. Charts uses the details you provided when you configure a provider to validate JWTs it receives with requests to render embedded charts. If the token is invalid or does not conform to the details you provided, Charts doesn't render the authenticated chart view. ## Prerequisites * You must be an Atlas [Project Owner](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#project-roles) to configure embedding authentication providers for your linkedCharts instance.\n* [Create a New Dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/#std-label-create-new-dashboard)\n* [Create a Chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/#std-label-create-new-chart) ## Procedures ### Enable Authenticated Embedding for a Chart Enable authenticated embedding to generate a Charts Base URL and a chart ID. You will need your Charts Base URL and chart ID to display your chart on a web page. 1 #### Select a dashboard. From your dashboard page, select the dashboard containing the chart you wish to embed. 2 #### Select a chart. From the dashboard, click  at the top-right of the chart to access its embedding information. SelectEmbed chart from the dropdown menu. ## Note If a chart is on a dashboard that has embedding enabled, theEmbed Chart option is automatically enabled. Therefore, you can't select the Embed chart option for charts within dashboards that have embedding enabled. 3 #### Enable external sharing on the data source If you have already enabled external sharing on the data source this chart uses, skip this step. If you haven't yet enabled embedding on the data source, you can do so now. Click theConfigure external sharing link. 4 #### Select the Authenticated tab in the dialog window. ![Embed authenticated chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/embed-chart-authenticated.png) 5 #### Toggle Enable authenticated access to On. 6 #### (_Optional_) Specify a filter function to inject per user. You can specify a function to inject a MongoDB filter document for each user who views the chart. This is useful for rendering user-specific charts. ## Example The following filter function only renders data where the`ownerId` field of a document matches the value of the Embedding Authentication Provider's token's `sub` field: `| function getFilter(context) {          |\n| -------------------------------------- |\n| return { ownerId: context.token.sub }; |\n| }                                      | ` ## Tip ### See also:  To learn more about injecting filters per user, see[Inject User-Specific Filters.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-embedded-charts/#std-label-inject-filter-per-user) 7 #### (_Optional_) Specify filterable fields for your chart. Specify the fields on which chart viewers can filter data.

8 #### Copy the Chart Base URL and Chart ID Use these values in your application code together with your Embedded Authentication Provider attributes to embed your chart. ### Configure Charts to use your Custom JWT Provider ## Note When you configure authentication using a custom JWT provider, you can choose the signing algorithm. This tutorial uses the HS256 signing algorithm. If you select the RS256 signing algorithm, you can also choose one of the following signing keys: * JSON web key ([JWK](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517)) or JSON web key set (JWKS) URL: Charts retrieves the key from the JWK or JWKS file at the specified URL. Charts then uses the key to validate the JSON web token. If there are multiple keys in the file, Charts tries each key until it finds a match.\n* PEM public key: Charts uses the specified public key to verify the JSON web token. 1 #### Go to the Authentication Settings view. 1. If Charts is not already displayed, clickCharts in the navigation bar.\n2. Click Embedding in the sidebar.\n3. Click the Authentication Settings tab. 2 #### From the Authentication providers section, click Add. 3 #### Provide the following values to configure Charts to validate the JWT for the tutorial. | Field             | Value                         |\n| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| Name              | Enter charts-jwt-tutorial.    |\n| Provider          | Select Custom JSON Web Token. |\n| Signing Algorithm | Select HS256.                 |\n| Signing Key       | Enter topsecret.              | 4 #### Click Save. ### Create a Web App to Display your Chart If you already have an app in which to display your chart, you’re all set. If not, proceed with the remaining steps. MongoDB offers a pre-built sample that shows you how to use the Embedding SDK to authenticate an embedded chart using a JWT. Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com//mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/charts/authenticated-custom-jwt)and follow the instructions in the **Readme** file to begin using the app. You can customize it to use the chart you created earlier. ### Customize the Node.js App 1 #### In your application server code, generate and return a JWT. The implementation varies based on your authentication provider. ## Warning Generate JWTs server-side to protect your signing keys from exposure. The `app.js` file in the sample application uses a simple web service and the `jsonwebtoken` package to generate and return aJWT signed using the `HS256` algorithm when a user logs in to the application with these credentials: * User name: `admin`\n* Password: `password` ```js 1 const express = require(\"express\"); 2 const bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\"); 3 const cors = require(\"cors\"); 4 const jwt = require(\"jsonwebtoken\"); 5 const config = require(\"./config.js\"); 6 7 const app = express(); 8 const port = 8000; 9 10 // Configuring body parser middleware 11

Collection](#create-a-charts-view-from-a-collection)\n* [Example Pipelines](#example-pipelines)\n* [Modify a Charts View's Pipeline](#modify-a-charts-view-s-pipeline)\n* [Disconnect a Charts View](#disconnect-a-charts-view)\n* [Delete a Charts View](#delete-a-charts-view) If you are the [Project Owner](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner), you can create and modify a charts view. A charts view is a data source that applies an[aggregation pipeline](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/)to a collection to pre-process data before it is used forCharts. You can create multiple charts views from a single collection. After you create a charts view, you can select the charts view as a data source when you create a chart. ## Use Cases Pre-processing a data source with a pipeline is useful when your collection data is not optimized for data visualization. Pre-processing your data can help accomplish the following tasks: * Join data from multiple collections into a single data source using[$lookup](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-lookup). [See example.](#std-label-join-data)\n* Hide fields which may contain sensitive data from Charts users using [$project](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/project/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-project). [See example.](#std-label-hide-data)\n* Convert data types, such as a string field to a date.[See example.](#std-label-convert-data-tye) ## Create a Charts View from a Collection 1 ### Connect your deployment. To learn more, see [Connect a Deployment to Charts.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/connect-disconnect-data-source/#std-label-connect-deployment) 2 ### Select a database and collection. 1. In the deployment's Data Access section, click the name of the database that contains the collection to use for the charts view. The collections list appears.\n2. Click the collection to use for the charts view.Charts also displays any existing charts views that use the collection. 3 ### Click Charts View next to the collection's information. Charts opens the Add Charts View modal. 4 ### Specify a Name for your charts view. 5 ### Add an aggregation pipeline. Your pipeline must be an array. Specify each stage of your pipeline as an object within the array. 6 ### (Optional) Click Test Pipeline. MongoDB Charts validates your pipeline. Charts reports any errors in your pipeline below the editor. If the pipeline is valid, Charts shows a sample document from the results or displays No documents returned. ## Tip For help creating your pipeline, you can utilize the[Aggregation Pipeline Builder](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/data-explorer/cloud-agg-pipeline/) in the Atlas Data Explorer. You can create your pipeline using the Atlas pipeline builder and paste it into the MongoDB Charts pipeline editor. 7 ### Click Save. After you save the charts view, it displays in theData Access section for the collection it uses. ## Example Pipelines ### Join Data from Two Collections The following example adds a pipeline to a data source pointing to the `sample_mflix.movies` collection from the[Sample Mflix Dataset](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/) provided byAtlas. The pipeline performs a [$lookup](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-lookup) to join data from the `comments` collection based on `movie_id`.

` ### Hide Sensitive Data The following example adds a pipeline to a data source pointing to the`sample_supplies.sales` collection from the[Sample Supply Store Dataset](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-supplies/)provided by Atlas. The pipeline hides the `customer.email` field, making that field unavailable to charts using this data source: ```js [   {     $project: { \"customer.email\": 0 }   } ] \n``` To learn more about the `$project` aggregation stage, see [$project.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/project/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-project) ### Convert the Type of a Data Field The following example adds a pipeline to a data source containing a string field that we want to convert to a date. The pipeline adds a new field to the data source with the string field `saleDate` converted to a date field called `saleDateAsDate`: ```js [   {     $addFields: {       saleDateAsDate: { $toDate: '$saleDate' }     }   } ] \n``` ## Modify a Charts View's Pipeline 1 ### Connect your deployment. To learn more, see [Connect a Deployment to Charts.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/connect-disconnect-data-source/#std-label-connect-deployment) 2 ### Select the database and collection. 1. In the deployment's Data Access section, click the name of the database that contains the collection associated with the charts view.\n2. Click the name of the collection associated with the charts view.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Getting Started Tutorial The Getting Started tutorial guides you through possible ways of beginning your use of MongoDB Charts. New Charts users or users who have not previously used dashboards in Charts are prompted to walk through the Getting Started tutorial. Refer to the following sections for information on the possible paths that the Getting Started tutorial offers: * [Connect Your Data Sources](#std-label-welcome-connect-data)\n* [Explore with Sample Data](#std-label-welcome-explore-data)\n* [Skip to Shared Data Sources or Dashboards](#std-label-welcome-skip-to-dashboards) ## Connect Your Data Sources Use the Connect Your Data path to connect your existingAtlas deployments to MongoDB Charts and visualize your data. ### Requirements & Limitations * You must have an existing Atlas deployment.  \nDeployments in MongoDB Charts reference Atlas deployments that contain valid Charts data sources, including:  \n   * All [clusters and serverless instances](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlascreate-database-deployment/) in your Atlasproject for which you have the[Project Data Access Read Only](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Data-Access-Read-Only) role or higher.  \n   * All [federated database instances](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/data-federation/) in your project, including[Online Archives.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/online-archive/manage-online-archive/)  \nIf you do not have an existing Atlas deployment, you can[Explore Charts with Sample Data.](#std-label-welcome-explore-data)\n* You must have read access in your project role to connectCharts to your data. To learn more about Atlas project roles, see [Atlas Project Roles](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#project-roles) ### Procedure Once you have selected Connect Your Data: 1 #### Select a cluster. Connect a deployment from your list of available deployments and click Next. 2 #### Select one or more collections to add as [Data Sources](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/data-sources/#std-label-data-sources). A data source in MongoDB Charts references one of the following: * A [collection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/databases-and-collections/#std-label-collections) or database[view](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/views/) in your MongoDB deployment.\n* A [charts view](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/create-manage-charts-view/#std-label-data-sources-pipeline) that you create using a collection. You can use the fields in the data source to construct a chart. When you build a chart, you must specify the data source that the chart uses. 3 #### Charts directs you to the Data Sources page. From there, you can[add pipelines](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/create-manage-charts-view/#std-label-data-sources-pipeline) and adjust[access permissions](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-data-sources/#std-label-permission-model) for your data sources. 4 #### You are free to explore [Dashboards](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/#std-label-dashboards) and [create charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/#std-label-build-charts). ## Explore with Sample Data MongoDB Charts provides a [Sample Dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/#std-label-sample-dashboard) that uses movie data to show examples of possible charts you can create. You can also use the[sample data source](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/data-sources/#std-label-charts-sample-data) to create your own charts on other dashboards. ### Procedure 1 #### Select the

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Highlight Chart Elements On this page * [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n* [Syntax](#syntax)\n* [Chart Types](#chart-types) The Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK enables you to programmatically highlight specific elements and [clicked events](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/handle-click-events/#std-label-handle-click-events) on embedded charts and charts within [embedded dashboards.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedding-dashboards/#std-label-embedding-dashboards) ## Prerequisites Before you begin, [install](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedding-charts-sdk/#std-label-embedding-charts-sdk) version 2.1.0 or later of the Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK. ## Syntax The Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK method for enabling highlighting has the following syntax: `| charts.setHighlight(selectionFilter); |\n| ------------------------------------- | ` ## Note If you want to highlight charts within an embedded dashboard, first run the following method to retrieve a specific chart from the Dashboard instance: ```javascript dashboard.getChart('<chartID>'); \n``` The `setHighlight` method takes an MQL filter. You can provide the MQL filter directly to the`setHighlight` method as shown in the example below or through the[click event payload](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/handle-click-events/#std-label-click-event-payload-selection-filter) `selectionFilter` to highlight specific elements and click events. ## Example ``` chart.setHighlight(   {     city: { $nin: ['New York', 'London', 'Paris'] }   } ) \n``` The `selectionFilter` must match on values used on the chart's category or series channel. The Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK also includes the `highlight`option for retrieving the highlight query: ```javascript const highlight = chart.getHighlight(); \n``` The `highlight` option takes a parameter of a Javascript object that represents an MQL filter.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Add a Lookup Field On this page * [Create a New Lookup Field](#create-a-new-lookup-field)\n* [Example](#example) Lookup fields allow you to create a chart that joins data from multiple collections in the same database. A lookup field brings in documents from a second collection whose values correspond to a field in your chart's main data source. Lookup fields are useful for leveraging parent/child and primary key/foreign key relationships between collections, or any situation in which a field in one collection references a field in another collection. Lookup fields use [$lookup](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/) to retrieve matching documents from a remote collection. ## Create a New Lookup Field You can create a lookup field from any field in your chart's data source which is not an [embedded object](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/rich-schema-support/#std-label-embedded-objects-arrays) and which contains matching data with a field in another collection. The remote collection must be: * An existing Charts data source.\n* Part of the same database as the local collection. ## Note You can also use the local collection as a lookup field source. To add a lookup field, mouse over an existing field and click on theellipsis (...) to the right of the field name. SelectLookup field from the dropdown menu. A modal window appears: ![Lookup field modal window](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/lookup-modal.png) Select the desired collection and field from the dropdown menus. The remote field must contain at least one document with data that matches the local field, or the lookup field will be empty. You have the option to either return all matching documents from the foreign collection or only the first matching document. Returning all matching documents is recommended for one-to-many relationships, such as parent/child and primary key relationships. Returning only the first document is recommended for one-to-one and many-to-one relationships, such as reference data codes. If you want to return only the first matching document, check theReturn only first matching document radio button. Charts suggests a name for the new field, but you can enter a name of your choosing if you prefer. Click Save to create the new field. The new field appears with a binoculars icon, indicating that it is a lookup field. ## Important Be sure that any field you use as a lookup field is appropriately[indexed](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/). Lookup operations on an unindexed field in a large collection can cause significant performance issues or timeouts. To remove a lookup field from your field panel, mouse over the lookup field and click on the ellipsis (...) to the right of the field name. Select Remove field from the dropdown menu. ## Example The following example uses two data sources, one called `product_catalog`and one called `orders`. The `product_catalog` collection contains the following documents: `| { \"_id\" : 76234, \"item\" : \"21 inch monitor\" }           |\n| ------------------------------------------------------- |\n| { \"_id\" : 38921, \"item\" : \"USB C cable\" }               |\n| { \"_id\" : 21167, \"item\" : \"keyboard\" }                  |\n| { \"_id\" : 90252, \"item\" : \"60 GB external hard drive\" } | ` The `orders` collection contains the following documents: ``` { \"_id\" : 1, \"sku\": 38921, \"quantity\": 50 } { \"_id\" : 2, \"sku\": 21167, \"quantity\": 75 } { \"_id\" : 3, \"sku\": 76234,

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Build Charts On this page * [Create a Chart](#create-a-chart)\n* [Learn More](#learn-more) Charts provide visual representations of the data in your[data source](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/data-sources/). A chart maps to a _single_data source, and can display correlations between several fields in the data. Charts reside inside [dashboards](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/). You must create a [dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/) before you can begin building charts. For a complete list of available chart types and how to build specific charts, refer to the [Chart Types](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-types/#std-label-chart-type-reference) page. ## Create a Chart 1 ### Select a dashboard for your chart. From the Dashboards page, select the dashboard where you wish to add a new chart. For instructions on setting up a dashboard, see [Dashboards.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/) 2 ### Click the Add Chart button. 3 ### Choose your chart's data source. In the Select Data Source modal that appears: 1. Select a tab:  \n   * The Suggested tab shows suggestions based on the data sources you use in this dashboard.  \n   * The Project tab shows all of your connected deployments. Click on a deployment to expand it and show its data sources. You can search for a collection to narrow the results.  \n   * The Sample tab shows the sample data source and a preview of its data.\n2. Click the name of the deployment that contains the data source.\n3. Click the name of the database that contains the data source. The database's data sources appear.  \nYou can click on a data source's name to view a preview of its data. ## Note A data source won't display on the Select Data Source modal unless it is connected toCharts. Only a [Project Owner](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner) can [connect](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/connect-disconnect-data-source/#std-label-connect-data-source) and[disconnect](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/connect-disconnect-data-source/#std-label-disconnect-data-source) data sources. All data sources in the project connect to Charts by default. 1. Click Select on the data source. If you close the Select Data Source modal, you can reopen it using the button under Data Source on the top left of the chart builder. The button says Select if you have not selected a data source, or it says the name of the currently selected data source. 4 ### Choose your chart type. In the Chart Type dropdown, select the type for this chart. ## Note ### Info Each chart type provides different visualization options for the fields in your data, reflected by various_encoding channels_. These channels dictate how your data is visualized and enable powerful[aggregations](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/) for your data. For details on the different encoding channel types, refer to the [Encoding Channels](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels)page. 5 ### Add fields to your chart. Drag fields from the Fields section to the desired[encoding channels](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels) below theChart Type dropdown. The fields listed correspond to the fields in your data source. You can search for a specific field in your data source by using the Filter search bar at the top of the Fields section. ## Tip ### See also:  For details on how MongoDB Charts handles embedded objects and embedded arrays in fields, see the[Embedded Objects and Arrays](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/rich-schema-support/#std-label-embedded-objects-arrays)page. 6 ### Title your chart.

options.](#optional-set-additional-options) You can embed a dashboard into a web application with an iframe and specify settings such as height, width, refresh interval, and display theme. You can embed only dashboards that don't require authentication (unauthenticated) within an iframe. ## Prerequisites * You must be a dashboard [Author](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-permissions/#std-label-dashboard-permissions) to enable embedding for a dashboard.\n* [Create a New Dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/#std-label-create-new-dashboard) ## Procedure 1 ### Select a dashboard. From your dashboard page, select the dashboard to embed. 2 ### Select Embed. From the dashboard, click  at the top-right of the dashboard to access its embedding information. SelectEmbed from the dropdown menu. 3 ### Enable external sharing on the data source. If you have already enabled external sharing on the data source that this dashboard uses, skip this step. If you haven't yet enabled embedding on the data source, you can do so now. Click theConfigure link. 4 ### Select the Unauthenticated tab in the dialog window. 5 ### Toggle Enable unauthenticated access to On. 6 ### (_Optional_) Specify filterable fields for your dashboard.

Alternatively, you can specify all the fields in your dashboard by selecting Allow all fields in the data source used in this dashboard.

Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref) provide high-level overviews of data trends by comparing values within a specific category. ![Stacked bar example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/stacked-bar-chart-reference-small.png) ## Line and Area Charts [Line and Area Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-line-area-chart-ref) display information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. ![Discrete area example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/discrete-area-small.png) ## Combo Charts [Combo Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/combo-charts/#std-label-combo-chart-ref) offer a combined column and line view. ![Combo chart example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/combo-chart.png) ## Grid Charts ### Heatmaps [Heatmaps](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/heatmap/#std-label-heatmap-chart-ref) represent aggregated data in a tabular format as a range of colors. ![Heatmap example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/heatmap-small.png) ### Scatter Charts [Scatter Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/scatter-chart/#std-label-scatter-chart-ref) plot data with individual data points placed along the X and Y axes. ![Scatter chart example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/scatter-chart-small.png) ## Circular Charts ### Donut Charts [Donut Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/donut-chart/#std-label-donut-chart-ref) display data in a series of segments of a circle, with larger segments representing larger data values. The entire circle represents the sum of all data values, and each segment indicates the proportion of each category in the data to the total. ![Donut Chart Example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/donut-simple-example.png) ### Gauge Charts [Gauge Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/gauge-chart/#std-label-gauge-chart-ref) display data as a percentage of a semicircle, with customizable minimum and maximum values. Optionally you may also specify a Target value, which renders as a heavy line within the gauge's range. ![Gauge Chart Example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/gauge-chart.png) ## Text

Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/geo-spatial/#std-label-geo-spatial) combine geospatial data with other forms of data to create map-based charts. ![Geospatial heatmap example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/geo-type-heatmap.png) ## Maximum Document Limit The maximum number of documents a chart displays data from differs based on the chart type. The limit is enforced on the server using a`$limit` stage at the end of the pipeline.

[Procedures](#procedures)\n* [Enable Authenticated Embedding for your Chart](#enable-authenticated-embedding-for-your-chart)\n* [Create a Google Client ID](#create-a-google-client-id)\n* [Configure Charts to use Google Sign-In](#configure-charts-short-to-use-google-sign-in)\n* [Create a Web App to Display Your Chart](#create-a-web-app-to-display-your-chart)\n* [Customize the Node.js App](#customize-the-node.js-app) This tutorial shows you how to configure a sample application to render an embedded, Google-authenticated chart on a web page. Users must sign in with their Google account to view the chart. If a user doesn't sign in with Google, Charts doesn't render the authenticated chart view. ## Prerequisites * You must be an Atlas [Project Owner](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#project-roles) to configure embedding authentication providers for your linkedCharts instance.\n* [Create a New Dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/#std-label-create-new-dashboard)\n* [Create a Chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/#std-label-create-new-chart) ## Procedures ### Enable Authenticated Embedding for your Chart Enable authenticated embedding to generate a Charts Base URL and a chart ID. You will need your Charts Base URL and chart ID to display your chart on a web page. 1 #### Select a dashboard. From your dashboard page, select the dashboard containing the chart you wish to embed. 2 #### Select a chart. From the dashboard, click  at the top-right of the chart to access its embedding information. SelectEmbed chart from the dropdown menu. ## Note If a chart is on a dashboard that has embedding enabled, theEmbed Chart option is automatically enabled. Therefore, you can't select the Embed chart option for charts within dashboards that have embedding enabled. 3 #### Enable external sharing on the data source If you have already enabled external sharing on the data source this chart uses, skip this step. If you haven't yet enabled embedding on the data source, you can do so now. Click theConfigure external sharing link. 4 #### Select the Authenticated tab in the dialog window. ![Embed authenticated chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/embed-chart-authenticated.png) 5 #### Toggle Enable authenticated access to On. 6 #### (_Optional_) Specify a filter function to inject per user. You can specify a function to inject a MongoDB filter document for each user who views the chart. This is useful for rendering user-specific charts. ## Example The following filter function only renders data where the`ownerId` field of a document matches the value of the Embedding Authentication Provider's token's `sub` field: `| function getFilter(context) {          |\n| -------------------------------------- |\n| return { ownerId: context.token.sub }; |\n| }                                      | ` ## Tip ### See also:  To learn more about injecting filters per user, see[Inject User-Specific Filters.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-embedded-charts/#std-label-inject-filter-per-user) 7 #### (_Optional_) Specify filterable fields for your chart. Specify the fields on which chart viewers can filter data. By default, no fields are specified, meaning the chart cannot be filtered until you explicitly allow at least one field. ## Tip ### See also:  To learn more about filterable fields, see[Specify Filterable Fields.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-embedded-charts/#std-label-specify-filter-fields) 8 #### Copy the Chart Base URL and Chart ID Use these values in your application code

[Unauthenticated Embedding](#unauthenticated-embedding) The following tutorials walk you through several scenarios for embedding charts in your application. ## Authenticated Embedding The following tutorials provide detailed instructions for embedding authenticated charts in a web application with the MongoDB Charts Embedding SDK. Authenticated embedded charts are viewable only by users who first provide login credentials through an SSO provider. [Embed a Chart Authenticated with Google Sign-In](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embed-chart-google-auth/#std-label-google-sdk-tutorial) Configure Charts to use Google Sign-In to authorize the rendering of embedded charts in an application. [Embed a Chart Authenticated with Atlas App Services](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embed-chart-stitch-auth/#std-label-stitch-sdk-tutorial) Configure Charts to use [Atlas App Services](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/) to authorize the rendering of embedded charts in an application. [Embed an Authenticated Chart using a Custom JWT Provider](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embed-chart-jwt-auth/#std-label-jwt-sdk-tutorial) Configure Charts to validate JWT to authorize the rendering of embedded charts in an application. ## Unauthenticated Embedding [Embed an Unauthenticated Chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embed-chart-anon-auth/#std-label-anon-embedding-charts) Configure

Aggregation Pipeline](#view-aggregation-pipeline)\n* [Get Chart Data](#get-chart-data) While editing a chart in the Chart Builder, you can view underlying data from the Ellipses (...) dropdown menu. Access to underlying data is intended to help you build meaningful charts as well as export that data for use with third-party tools. ![The ellipse menu is in the top-right corner of the charts editor.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/editor-ellipse-menu.png) ## View Source Documents Once you have selected a [data source](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/data-sources/) for your chart, you can view up to 20 sample documents from that data source by clicking View Source Documents from the menu. ## Note If you want to explore your data source beyond 20 sample documents, you can use [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) or the[Atlas Data Explorer.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/data-explorer/) The sample documents are intended for reference to help you build a chart. The documents do not reflect any groupings or projections applied to an existing chart (i.e. any Encode panel options in the Chart Builder). The documents are produced with a query on your data source that considers: * [Pipelines applied to the data source](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/create-manage-charts-view/#std-label-data-sources-pipeline)\n* [Queries](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-query-bar) or[pipelines specified in the Chart Builder](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/aggregation-pipeline/#std-label-charts-agg-pipeline)\n* Filters applied in the [Filter Tab](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-filter-tab) The Source Documents modal displays the number of documents from your data source that match your query conditions, although only 20 of the documents are viewable as samples. ![The View Source Documents modal displays the document count just above the document samples.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/source-document-count.png) ## View Aggregation Pipeline After you have configured a valid chart, you can view the source query for the chart. MongoDB Charts uses a special type of query to create a chart called an[aggregation pipeline](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/). To view the query, click View Aggregation Pipeline from the menu. This aggregation pipeline includes the stages that both the data source and the Chart Builder apply. ## Important Some Chart Builder [configuration options](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/)don't apply aggregation stages. These options are applied to a chart's visualization and do not affect the underlying data. To use the pipeline in other MongoDB tools, such as[Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/) or the [mongo shell](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/mongo/), click next to the pipeline in theAggregation Pipeline modal. To learn how Charts constructs aggregation pipelines, see [Backing Aggregation Pipeline.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/aggregation-pipeline-generation/#std-label-aggregation-pipeline-generation) ## Get Chart Data After you have configured a valid chart, you can view and export the underlying data as a table. To view the chart data, clickGet Chart Data from the  menu. Each row in the table represents a data point. ## Important ### Data Table Differs from Chart Visualization Some configuration options you see reflected on a chart visualization are not applied to the data table. TheChart Data table displays underlying data retrieved with your full aggregation pipeline, and not all Chart Builder configuration options apply aggregation stages. Review your data to verify its contents. If you want to analyze your underlying data with a third-party tool, you can download your data from the Chart Data modal.

### Caching Behavior When MongoDB Charts loads charts on a dashboard, it does not consistently query the data source for each chart. Instead, MongoDB Charts queries the data sources when the dashboard first loads, and that data is cached on both the client and server. ## Note The data stored in the cache is encrypted with a key specific to your MongoDB Charts tenant. * When a dashboard refreshes automatically:  \n   * If a chart's data is within the staleness tolerance period,Charts doesn't refresh the chart's data.  \n   * If a chart's data is outside of the staleness tolerance period,Charts returns the latest data from the server cache. If the server cache contains stale data, Charts queries the data source for the latest data, refreshes the chart, and updates the data cached on both the client and server.  \n   ## Note  \n   If your chart is embedded using[Atlas App Services Authentication](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embed-chart-stitch-auth/#std-label-stitch-sdk-tutorial)andFetch data using Atlas App Services is enabled in your[Authentication Provider Settings](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/configure-auth-providers/#std-label-configure-auth-providers), your chart does not load data from the server cache. Your `maxDataAge` embedding parameter still dictates how often the chart refreshes, but the data source is always queried on each render.\n* When you manually refresh an entire dashboard, Charts updates all chart data by querying the data source for the latest data even if the chart data is within the specified staleness tolerance period. ### Refresh Failures When an automatic or manual refresh fails: * MongoDB Charts displays the most recently rendered chart, including all of the chart's interactive elements.\n* If MongoDB Charts has never successfully rendered the chart, the following message is displayed: `Unable to load data`.\n* MongoDB Charts displays the following error message at the bottom of the chart: `Last refresh failed`.\n* If you're viewing the chart on an Authenticated Dashboard, click the failed link in the error message to view additional error details.  \n## Note  \nThis link is not available when you view charts on a dashboard from a public link or embedded using an iframe or the SDK.\n* The error message includes a Refresh link if the chart is rendered on an authenticated dashboard or embedded using an iframe or the SDK.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Customize Charts MongoDB Charts provides various options to customize the format and display of your visualizations. You can use these options to display your data in the proper format, show data labels to relay precise measurements, and many other formatting techniques. The documentation for specific chart types covers additional customization options pretaining to those charts. See the [Chart Types](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-types/#std-label-chart-type-reference) page to learn more about customizing a particular chart type. MongoDB Charts provides the following types of customization options: General [General Customization Options](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/general-customization/#std-label-general-customization) modify high-level aspects of the chart such as its colors and data labels. These options affect the overall look and format of your data. Axes [Value Axis Options](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/value-axis-options/#std-label-value-axis-options) modify the chart's axes, such as their scale and their minimum and maximum values. These options only affect the chart's axes, and not howCharts formats data points in the visualization. Fields [Field-Level Options](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/field-level-options/#std-label-field-level-options) modify howCharts renders data fields, such as specific formatting for numbers and dates. These options apply to individual data fields[encoded](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels) into your chart, rather than the chart as a whole. The field-level customization options available depend on the data type and[channel type](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-charts-channel-type-table) of the field you are customizing. Conditional Formatting [Conditional Formatting Options](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/conditional-formatting/#std-label-conditional-formatting) modify the styling of chart values that meet conditions you define. These options affect the look of your chart dynamically: if a value changes to meet or stop meeting your conditions, its styling updates to reflect that.

The data source connects and the Data Accesssection displays. ## Modify Data Source Permissions If you have the [Project Owner](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner) role, you can control who can see charts that use the data source. ### Enable Organization-Wide Sharing for a Data Source Organization-wide sharing grants users in your organization, including users who are not members of your project, permission to view data in a deployment that is used for dashboards shared with your organization. You can enable organization-wide sharing[for an entire deployment](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-deployment/#std-label-org-sharing-deployment) or[for a specific data source.](#std-label-org-sharing-data-source) To enable organization-wide sharing for a specific data source: 1 #### Access the data source's settings page. To learn more, see [Access Data Source Settings.](#std-label-access-data-source-settings-page) 2 #### Turn on organization-wide sharing. In the Organization subsection of theData Access section, toggleAll users in the organization can view data in this data source to ON. ### Enable External Sharing for a Data Source External sharing grants others the ability to either: * [Embed charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedding-charts/#std-label-embedding-charts) to use the data source in external web pages.\n* View charts when given a link to that chart. To share a chart externally via embed or link, you must enable external sharing both on the data source and the individual chart. Charts disables external sharing by default for all data sources. To enable external sharing for a data source: 1 #### Access the data source's settings page. To learn more, see [Access Data Source Settings.](#std-label-access-data-source-settings-page) 2 #### Turn on external sharing. In the External Users subsection of the Data Access section, toggleExternal users can view data in this data source toON. 3 #### Select your authentication settings. Select either: 1. Allow authenticated external data access.  \nAny chart that uses this data source requires authentication through anSSO provider for external viewing. Authentication providers add an extra layer of security to your data.  \nTo learn how to configure an embedding authentication provider, see [Configure Embedding Authentication Providers.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/configure-auth-providers/)  \nUsers can view charts that use this data source on dashboards when they are logged into MongoDB Charts. They can't view the charts on dashboards shared via a public link.\n2. Allow unauthenticated external data access.  \nAny chart that uses this data source does **not** require authentication for external viewing. Though less difficult to implement, allowing unauthenticated external data access is less secure. Use this option only for charts that display non-sensitive data.  \n   * Embedded charts can render using both unauthenticated and authenticated requests.  \n   * Any charts using this data source can be viewed on[dashboards shared via a link.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-permissions/#std-label-dashboard-access-link) After you enable external sharing for a data source, you can enable external sharing for individual charts that use that data source. ## Note If you turn off external sharing for a data source, all charts which use that data source stop rendering immediately. ### Disable External Sharing for a Data Source To disable external sharing for a data source: 1 #### Access the data source's settings page. To learn more, see [Access Data Source Settings.](#std-label-access-data-source-settings-page) 2 #### Turn off external sharing.

## Note Charts automatically assigns project roles to users based on their Atlas [user role.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/) To modify permissions for a project role: 1 #### Access the data source's settings page. To learn more, see [Access Data Source Settings.](#std-label-access-data-source-settings-page) 2 #### Select or clear boxes in the project role's row. For each project role, you can select more than one option: * Can view charts with data in this data source.\n* Can create charts with data in this data source. Hover over a project role to learn which [Atlas user roles](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/) correspond to that project role. To prevent users with a project role from creating and viewing charts for the data source, clear both boxes in the project role's row. To allow all users to create and view charts for the data source, select all of the boxes in all of the rows. ### Modify Data Source Read Preference To modify a data source's read preference, you must modify the read preference for its deployment. To learn more, see[Manage Deployments.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-deployment/#std-label-manage-deployment) ## Modify Data Source Pipeline You can modify a chart view's pipeline by[accessing the data source's settings page](#std-label-access-data-source-settings-page) and clicking thePipeline tab. To learn more, see[Create and Manage Charts Views.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/create-manage-charts-view/#std-label-data-sources-pipeline) The Pipeline is dimmed for collections. To create a pipeline based on a collection, [create a charts view.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/create-manage-charts-view/#std-label-charts-views) ## Disconnect a Data Source To disconnect a data source, see [Connect or Disconnect Data Sources and Deployments](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/connect-disconnect-data-source/#std-label-connect-disconnect-data-source).

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Create a Multi-Series Chart On this page * [Map Multiple Fields to a Single Axis](#map-multiple-fields-to-a-single-axis)\n* [Series Field](#series-field)\n* [count by value Aggregation Option](#count-by-value-aggregation-option) MongoDB Charts supports building _multi-series_ charts, which split your chart data into groups, or _series_, to compare additional fields within your schema. There are two ways to create multi-series charts: * [Map Multiple Fields to a Single Axis](#std-label-multiple-field-mappings). Use this method to compare or aggregate upon multiple non-categorical fields in the schema.\n* [Using the Series field in the chart builder](#std-label-charts-series-encoding). Use this method when grouping data based on a discrete list of items. ## Map Multiple Fields to a Single Axis MongoDB Charts allows you to map multiple [Aggregation](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-building-charts-aggregation) or Value fields to a single chart property (such as the X Axis or Y Axis). This allows you to compare additional fields by creating new series based on the encoding channels added. After dragging a field to an aggregationor value [encoding channel](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels), an additional optional encoding channel of the same type appears below the one which was just added, allowing you to add additional series to your visualization. This process repeats with each channel you add, so you can map as many fields as desired to your chart. ## Example The following multi-series column chart shows average movie ratings by genre from two different sources: [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)and [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/): ![Movie Ratings Multiseries Chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/multi-series-agg.png) There are two aggregation encoding channels on the chart's Y Axis, one for each of the site's rating fields. By selecting the mean aggregation option, the chart aggregates these two fields using the[$avg](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/avg/) operator to provide a comparison of the average of two fields in the same column. ## Tip Use multiple field mappings to create a multi-series chart when the values being compared in the visualization come from two or more separate fields in the schema. In the example above, there is one series for Rotten Tomato ratings and one series for IMDB ratings. Since these are separate fields within the schema, adding multiple aggregation encoding channels to map the data is the best choice to compare the fields. ## Tip ### See also:  If you omit the Category field, you can create a single-series chart based on your selected aggregated fields. To learn more, see [Create a Single-Series Chart with Multiple Aggregations.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/single-series-categories/#std-label-single-series-multiple-fields) ### Use a Secondary Y Axis If you map multiple Aggregation or Value fields to the Y axis, you can plot one set of values on a [secondary Y axis.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/value-axis-options/#std-label-secondary-y-axis) ## Series Field You can also create multi-series charts by using the Seriesfield in the chart builder. The Series field differs fromaggregation [encoding channels](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels)because it instead utilizes a Category [encoding channel](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-charts-channel-type-table) instead of aValue or Aggregation channel. When creating a series using the Category encoding channel, each unique value from the data field becomes a series in the visualization. ## Example The following multi-series column chart shows order data from an office supply store, showing the most common items sold by store location: ![Supply Store Series Encoding Channel Example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/series-encoding-channel-example.png) By using the `item.name` in the Series encoding channel, a series within each location group is added for

## `count by value` Aggregation Option When you drag a field onto an [aggregation channel](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-building-charts-aggregation), you can select the count by value option to create a multi-series chart based on the values contained in the field. A series is automatically created for each unique value from the field, with the chart value representing the number of occurrences. Your chart can display multiple count by value fields with additional aggregations, as long as there is no field mapped to the category axis. ## Note If any field in the X or Y axis channel has thecount by value aggregation selected, the Serieschannel is disabled, and any field previously mapped to that channel is removed. ## Example The following multi-series bar chart uses the `sample_airbnb`database. It groups listings by the number of beds and the number of bedrooms they have, showing the total number of listings for each value. ![Count by value multi-series chart example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/count-by-value-sample-chart2.png) You can also create a multi-series chart with a count by value aggregation channel and a category axis channel. ## Example The following multi-series stacked column chart uses the `sample_airbnb`database. It shows all the different suburbs of Turkey with the number of each distinct type of property located there. ![Count by value multi-series chart example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/count-by-value-sample-chart.png) The `address.suburb` field populates the X axis, while the stacked columns represent all the different property

dashboard, you can interact with a chart that hasFilter or highlight enabled to filter data in other charts. With Filter or highlight enabled, clicking a chart element with an associated [dashboard filter](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-filtering/#std-label-dashboard-filtering)temporarily reconfigures the scope of that dashboard filter to a single chart series, category or field value. Interactive filtering is useful for getting quick insights into subcategories of your data on dashboards with multiple charts. Interactive filtering is temporary; you can revert to your original dashboard filter at any time. To enable Filter or highlight: 1. Hover over the chart on the dashboard to reveal four buttons in the upper right corner of the chart.\n2. Click the second button for Interactive Filters.\n3. Select Filter or highlight from the dropdown. ## Note By default, charts set Interactive Filters toFilter or highlight. Setting a chart's Interactive Filters toFilter reflects dashboard filters and temporary interactive filters. That chart cannot be highlighted to set interactive filters on other charts. Setting a chart's Interactive Filters toIgnore ignores any dashboard or interactive filters. ## Example On the MongoDB Charts [Sample Dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/#std-label-sample-dashboard), movie statistics are displayed across a range of chart types. If you create a dashboard filter for `rated`, the content rating of a movie (e.g. G, PG-13, R), you can click a specific movie rating on any one of your charts to temporarily reconfigure the scope of your dashboard filter to that specific movie rating. If you click on the PG-13 rating section of theMovie Ratings donut chart, the rest of the charts on your dashboard update to display only data for PG-13 movies. When you [clear the selection](#std-label-remove-interactive-filter) of the PG-13 rating, your dashboard reverts to displaying charts according to the `rated` dashboard filter. The chart upon which you set an interactive filter is highlighted,_not_ filtered. It [emphasizes](#std-label-emphasize-series) the element for which your other charts are filtered. You can[clear the selection](#std-label-remove-interactive-filter) from that highlighted chart. A highlighted chart displays a status icon in the bottom left corner. Filtered charts display the  icon.

### Filter a Dashboard by a Chart Element To interactively filter a dashboard based on a chart element, you must first create a dashboard filter for the field that you want to filter by. ## Example To filter the [Sample Dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/#std-label-sample-dashboard) to only English movies, you must have a dashboard filter on the `language`field. To filter a dashboard by a chart element, you can click on: * a legend entry\n* a chart category, such as an X or Y series label\n* a chart mark, such as a bar segment or line chart node When you hover over a chart element with an associated dashboard filter, your cursor displays the  icon. If a chart element isn't filterable, your cursor displays the icon. You might be able to add a dashboard filter for that value's field to make that element filterable. ## Note If the dashboard filter card associated with a clicked element is disabled, Charts enables it temporarily until you[clear the selection](#std-label-remove-interactive-filter) of that element. When you filter a dashboard by a chart element, Charts disables all other dashboard filters until you clear the selection. ### Remove an Interactive Filter You can remove an interactive dashboard filter by: * Clicking the whitespace on the highlighted chart upon which you set the interactive filter, or\n* Changing the associated dashboard filter. ## Click to Emphasize Series Chart viewers can interact with a chart to highlight one or more series in a multi-series chart. This behavior applies to any chart type that displays a discrete color legend, except for geospatial charts. The following chart types support emphasizing specific series: * [Grouped and Stacked Bar/Column charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref)\n* [Discrete and Continuous Line/Area charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-line-area-chart-ref)\n* [Scatter charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/scatter-chart/#std-label-scatter-chart-ref)\n* [Donut charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/donut-chart/#std-label-donut-chart-ref) ### Emphasize a Single Series When you click a label in the chart legend at the top right,Charts emphasizes the selected data series by reducing the opacity of all the other data series. ![Emphasize single data series](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/emphasize-single-series.png) ### Emphasize Multiple Data Series To emphasize multiple data series at once, **shift-click** as many labels in the legend as you would like. Charts adjusts the opacity of the selected data series from de-emphasized to emphasized. ![Emphasize multiple data series](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/multiple-series-emphasized.png) ### Emphasize All Data Series To restore the opacity of all data series to the default emphasized state, click the chart background. ![Emphasize all data series](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/all-series-emphasized.png) ## Zoom and Pan a Scatter Chart Chart viewers can zoom and pan a non-geospatial [scatter chart.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/scatter-chart/#std-label-scatter-chart-ref) ### Zoom To zoom in or out of the chart, scroll up or down. Chartsautomatically adjusts the axis bounds to change the viewport, while keeping the plotted points the same size. The resulting view after zooming and panning is only visible to you and does not persist page reloads. To revert back to the original axis bounds, reload the chart page. ### Pan To pan the chart, click and drag over the chart surface. ## View the Percentage of the Whole Chart viewers can hover on each data point to view the value as a percentage of the whole.

filters refine data across some or all of the charts in a dashboard. They allow you to view a common subset of data across the dashboard's charts. Dashboard `Authors` or `Owners` can: * Select the fields that all dashboard users can use to filter data.\n* Set initial default values for each filter.\n* Disable filtering for a specific chart. Disabling filtering exempts the chart from dashboard filters. All dashboard users can filter based on values they specify and save their own default filter values. ## Note Users who open a dashboard using a public link can't save their own default filter values. Charts reverts to the initial default filter values after refreshing the page or starting a new session. ![An image of a dashboard. The :guilabel:`Dashboard Filters`\npane is highlighted.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/dashboard-filter-cards.png) If one or more dashboard filters affect the data a chart displays, an icon displays in the bottom left corner of that chart. Hover over the  icon for a list of the filtered fields impacting that chart. ## Note Dashboard `Authors` or `Owners` define filters using specific data sources and can [disable filtering on specific charts](#std-label-disable-filtering-on-chart). A single filter might not refine all charts if: * The dashboard contains charts mapped to data sources that the filter doesn't use.\n* A dashboard `Author` or `Owner` [disables filtering](#std-label-disable-filtering-on-chart) on some charts. ### Example Scenario A dashboard `Author` creates a dashboard with charts that contain sales data for all of a company's customers. The author creates a filter allowing dashboard viewers to select which region(s) to display data from. Members of a sales team use this filter to display customer data only for the region(s) that they cover. ## Tip You can use a prebuilt[sample dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/#std-label-add-sample-dashboard)to experiment with dashboard filters. ### Filter Persistence Per Dashboard Viewer Charts persists the following states for each dashboard viewer across reloads and user sessions: * which filters are enabled or disabled\n* field values chosen to filter dashboards\n* whether the Dashboard Filters is expanded or collapsed. The changes that a dashboard viewer makes to filters don't affect otherCharts users. A viewer's saved filters are not affected when a dashboard `Author` or `Owner` modifies a filter's default values unless you [reset a filter.](#std-label-revert-dashboard-filters) ## Note Charts doesn't persist filter states or values for users who open a dashboard using a public link. Charts reverts to the initial default filter values after refreshing the page or starting a new session. ### The Dashboard Filters Pane The Dashboard Filters icon indicates the number of active filters.

The Dashboard Filters pane displays a filter card for each field you can use to filter chart data. You can configure filter cards to use related fields from multiple data sources. When you update a field value, Charts updates dashboard charts to display data that matches the field values you provide from all configured data sources. In the following example, a dashboard `Author` creates filters on the `genres` and `year` fields from two sample movie datasets. The`Author` sets default values for these fields to only display Science Fiction and History movies released in or after 1968\\. Dashboard`Viewers` can provide their own values for the filterable fields to refine chart data based on their interests. ![An image of a dashboard. The :guilabel:`Edit Dashboard Filters`\npane is highlighted.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/edit-dashboard-filters.png) To learn about filtering options for each field data type, see[Create Filters for Your Data.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-filter-tab) ### Expand or Collapse Dashboard Filters You can expand or collapse dashboard filter cards by clickingShow or Hide on that card. Disabled filters are automatically collapsed. Enabled, collapsed filters are still applied to your charts. ## Manage Dashboard Filters Dashboard `Authors` and `Owners` can: * Add, edit, and delete dashboard filters.\n* Disable dashboard filters on specific charts. ### Add Dashboard Filters You can specify fields that any dashboard users can filter data with. When you create a dashboard filter, you select related fields from the data sources that a dashboard chart uses. You can add dashboard filters based on any number of data sources that a dashboard chart uses. Filter cards that use multiple data sources query each chart using the name of the field from the applicable data set. ## Example Chart `A` uses data set `A`. Chart `B` uses data set `B`. Field `A` in data set `A` and field `B` in data set `B`contain related information. You add both fields to a single filter card.

[Aggregation](#aggregation)\n* [Geopoint Channel Type](#geopoint-channel-type)\n* [Add Missing Fields in the Chart Builder](#add-missing-fields-in-the-chart-builder) Encoding channels are the building blocks of your visualizations. These channels are the means by which Charts translates data from your [collection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/databases-and-collections/) to the visualization. The encoding process dictates how that data appears in the chart based on the [channel type](#std-label-charts-channel-type-table) selected. ## Encoding Channel Types Each encoding channel type provides different capabilities for processing and visualizing your data.

Charts shows required encoding channels in green, and optional encoding channels in blue. ## Aggregation Dragging a field onto an aggregation [encoding channel](#std-label-encoding-channels) allows you to use an[aggregation pipeline operator](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/)on that field. For a list of the available aggregation pipeline operators inCharts, see [Aggregation Options.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/aggregation-options/#std-label-aggregation-options) ## Example Donut charts provide two encoding channels: * A category channel called Label dictating which field to use when dividing the sections of the chart.\n* An aggregation channel called Arc dictating the aggregation operation to perform on the Labelcategory. The following donut chart examines NASA's Landslide data source to show the frequency of various landslide triggers by performing a[$count](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/count/) aggregation on the `trigger` field: ![Donut chart example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/donut-chart-example-2.png) We see from the chart that the most common landslide trigger is`Downpour` followed by `Rain`. ## Geopoint Channel Type Geopoint channel types are used in the Coordinates channel on Geospatial Scatter and Geospatial Heatmapchart types. Geospatial charts visualize data that references specific geographic locations. MongoDB Charts automatically determines which fields in your dataset, if any, are [GeoJSON Points](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/geojson/).Charts signifies these fields with a icon. You can map these fields directly to a geopoint channel type by dragging them onto an appropriate geopoint channel type in the chart builder. Charts automatically determines the latitude and longitude values from the field and adds a point to the map for each document. ## Note You can also assign numeric coordinates or arrays to a geopoint channel type to specify latitude and longitude not stored as [GeoJSON Points](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/geojson/#point). For details on this process, see the following section. ### Assign Non-GeoJSON Fields to a Geopoint Channel Type This section describes how to use fields not stored as[GeoJSON Points](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/geojson/#point) in a geopoint channel type. * You can drag numeric fields onto a geopoint channel type to specify latitude and longitude. When you drag a numeric field onto a geopoint channel type, the channel updates to use the selected field as either Latitude or Longitude.Charts prompts you for a second numeric field to fill in the other value.\n* Alternatively, you can drag a numeric array onto a geopoint channel type to specify location coordinates from a field. When you use this approach, you can specify which indexes of the array to use for latitude and longitude components. For additional information and examples on Geospatial Scatter and Heatmap charts which utilize geopoint channel types, refer to the relevant chart type pages. ## Add Missing Fields in the Chart Builder MongoDB Charts populates the Fields pane of the chart builder by randomly sampling documents from the selected data source. As a result, Charts might not display all fields from documents in the data source if the field is not present on all documents. To add a specific field in the chart builder: 1. In the corner of the Fields pane, clickAdd Field.\n2. Make sure that the default Missed field type is selected.\n3. Enter the Field Name of the field you want to add.  \n## Note  \nYou can specify a nested field by using dot notation. For example, you can specify `address.neighborhood`.\n4.

[Procedures](#procedures)\n* [Enable Unauthenticated Embedding for a Chart](#enable-unauthenticated-embedding-for-a-chart)\n* [Create a Web App to Display Your Chart](#create-a-web-app-to-display-your-chart)\n* [Customize the Node.js App](#customize-the-node.js-app) You can embed a chart in a web application and not require authentication to view chart data. To restrict access to your embedded chart, see the[authenticated embedded chart tutorials.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedding-tutorials/#std-label-authenticated-embedding-tutorials) ## Prerequisites * You must be a dashboard [Author](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-permissions/#std-label-dashboard-permissions) to enable unauthenticated embedding for a chart.\n* [Create a New Dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/#std-label-create-new-dashboard)\n* [Create a Chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/#std-label-create-new-chart) ## Procedures ### Enable Unauthenticated Embedding for a Chart Enable unauthenticated embedding to generate a chart ID and ChartsBase URL. You will need your chart ID and Charts Base URL to display your chart on a web page. 1 #### Select a dashboard. From your dashboard page, select the dashboard containing the chart you wish to make embeddable. 2 #### Select a chart. From the dashboard, click  at the top-right of the chart to access its embedding information. SelectEmbed chart from the dropdown menu. ## Note If a chart is on a dashboard that has embedding enabled, theEmbed Chart option is automatically enabled. Therefore, you can't select the Embed chart option for charts within dashboards that have embedding enabled. 3 #### Enable external sharing on the data source. If you have already enabled external sharing on the data source this chart uses, skip this step. If you haven't yet enabled embedding on the data source, you can do so now. Click theConfigure external sharing link. 4 #### Select the Unauthenticated tab in the dialog window. ![Embed unauthenticated chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/embed-chart-anon.png) 5 #### Toggle Enable unauthenticated access to On. 6 #### (_Optional_) Specify filterable fields for your chart. Specify the fields on which chart viewers can filter data. By default, no fields are specified, meaning the chart cannot be filtered until you explicitly allow at least one field. Alternatively, you can specify all the fields in your chart by selecting Allow all fields in the data source used in this chart. To learn more about filterable fields, see[Specify Filterable Fields.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-embedded-charts/#std-label-specify-filter-fields) 7 #### Select the Javascript SDK panel. 8 #### Copy the Charts Base URL and Chart ID. You'll need the Charts Base URl and Chart ID values in your web application code. ### Create a Web App to Display Your Chart If you already have an app in which to display your chart, you're ready to add an unauthenticated embedded chart. If not, proceed with the remaining steps to create a new app. MongoDB offers a pre-built example app in the[GitHub repository](https://github.com//mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/charts/unauthenticated) that shows how to use the Embedding SDK to display an unauthenticated embedded chart. Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com//mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/)to get all the example apps. Instructions for running the unauthenticated example are in the [Readme](https://github.com//mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/charts/unauthenticated) file in the `unauthenticated` directory.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Charts on Atlas Pricing On this page * [Overview](#overview)\n* [Sample Pricing Scenarios](#sample-pricing-scenarios) ## Overview Charts on Atlas is metered based on the volume of data transferred from the Charts web server to web browser clients. MongoDB provides each Charts instance with a free `1 GB` of data transfers per month. You can view your Charts instance's monthly data usage in the [Data Transfer](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/admin-settings/#std-label-admin-usage) page. The free usage tier provides approximately 500,000 chart renders over a month. However, this number may vary based on the types of charts being rendered. A number chart or a bar chart with few bars typically consumes less data, while a scatter chart with many data points or a large table could consume more. Once the `1 GB` of free data usage has been consumed, MongoDB bills Charts data transfers at a fixed rate of **$1.00 per GB**. In addition, any applicable Atlas data transfer fees apply, as per the Data Transfer Fees section of the[Atlas Pricing](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/pricing) page.Charts is hosted on AWS `us-east-1` region, and uses this region to calculate the fees. ## Sample Pricing Scenarios The following examples show the expected monthly charge for different usage scenarios. Consider: 1. A Charts instance with 5 users, each of whom refreshes a 10-chart [dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/#std-label-dashboards) once an hour during business hours. This results in about 8,000 renders over the month, and easily falls within the `1 GB` free tier.\n2. A dashboard on a large-screen display with 20 charts set to refresh every 5 minutes, all 24 hours of the day. This results in about 300,000 renders over the month. Assuming these charts are not abnormally large, this scenario also falls entirely within the`1 GB` free tier.\n3. A _large_ chart embedded on a web page that receives 10,000 views per day, resulting in 300,000 renders over the month. This chart takes roughly five times as much data to render compared to a typical chart, and consumes `3 GB` of data over the month.  \nThe first `1 GB` is free, and the remaining `2 GB` is billed at

Dashboards are the cornerstone of MongoDB Charts as they are where you create and view your data visualizations. For details on how to create, manage, and share dashboards, see [Dashboards.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/) ## Note Since a chart can only display data from a single collection, dashboards which combine multiple charts are not only useful, but necessary for visualizing data from multiple collections in a single view. This can lead to new insights into your data which may not be immediately apparent. ## Chart Types MongoDB Charts provides a wide variety of chart types to visualize your data including bar charts, scatter plots, geospatial charts, and more. For a complete list of available chart types, see[Chart Types.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-types/#std-label-chart-type-reference) ## Tutorials After you [launch MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/launch-charts/#std-label-launch-charts), the following tutorials will help you get started building visualizations with your data and explore key features offered by MongoDB Charts: [Movie Details Tutorial](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/tutorial/movie-details/movie-details-tutorial-overview/#std-label-movie-details-tutorial-overview) Visualize a data set containing details on movies, such as cast, critic reviews, and release. [Order Data Tutorial](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/tutorial/order-data/order-data-tutorial-overview/#std-label-order-data-tutorial-overview) Visualize a data set containing sales data from a mock office supply store.

Syntax](#click-event-syntax)\n* [Payload](#payload)\n* [event Element](#event-element)\n* [data Element](#data-element)\n* [selectionFilter Element](#selectionfilter-element)\n* [target Element](#target-element)\n* [Examples](#examples)\n* [Basic Handling of Click Events](#basic-handling-of-click-events)\n* [Interactive Filtering for Click Events](#interactive-filtering-for-click-events) ## Note Click Events in the [Charts Embedding SDK](https://github.com/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk)is available in version 2.1.0 and later. The Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK includes a click event handler that allows you to subscribe to click events. When you click on a particular element on your chart, the click event handler captures details of the element that you clicked. Use this feature to build interactive experiences similar to the following in your application: * Click on an element on a chart and open a pane with more details on the clicked element.\n* Create a filter for another chart. ## Prerequisites Before you begin, [install](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedding-charts-sdk/#std-label-embedding-charts-sdk) version 2.1.0 or later of the Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK. ## Click Event Syntax The event handler takes an event type, `click`, and a callback function that contains information about the click event and the clicked element as a single [payload](#std-label-click-event-payload)object. The click event handler syntax looks similar to the following: `| chart.addEventListener(\"click\", callback); |\n| ------------------------------------------ | ` The event handler also allows you to define the mark roles for which you want to receive event information, thus eliminating the need to check the payload. The click event handler syntax for defining the mark roles to filter by looks similar to the following: ```shell const options = { includes: [{ roles: ['mark', 'axis-label'] }] }; chart.addEventListener(\"click\", callback, options); \n``` The click event handler must be added after the chart has finished rendering, as shown in the following example: ## Example ```shell chart.render(document.getElementById(\"chart\")).then(      () => chart.addEventListener('click',        (payload) => alert(JSON.stringify(payload)),        options)    ); \n``` ## Note If you specify the `options` parameter, the click event handler captures events only if the clicked mark's role matches one of the values specified in the parameter. If you omit this parameter, the click event handler captures all click events on the chart. ## Payload You can use the click event payload to construct a custom filter that you can apply on other charts in your application. The syntax of the payload object for the callback function looks similar to the following: ```shell chart.addEventListener(\"click\", (payload) => {     // handle events } \n``` The following example payload object shows the elements inside the payload: ## Example ```shell {   \"chartId\": \"xxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\",   \"chartTitle\": \"This is my chart's title\",   \"chartDescription\": \"This is my chart's description\",   \"event\": { // information about the mouse event. For example:     \"type\": \"click\", // event type     \"altKey\": false, // modifier keys     \"ctrlKey\": false,     \"shiftKey\": false,     \"metaKey\": false,     \"offsetX\": 152, // element coordinates     \"offsetY\": 176,     \"clientX\": 172, // coordinates from application viewpoint     \"clientY\": 241,     \"pageX\": 172, // coordinates relative to the page     \"pageY\": 241,     \"screenX\": 172, // coordinates relative to screen     \"screenY\": 312   },   \"data\": { // information about the clicked chart element.

channel `label`\n* The `value` of the clicked element\n* The lower bound for numeric or date binning only For [data tables](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/data-table/#std-label-data-table-ref), the Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK click event handler captures click events for fields that represent the channel data for the clicked element: * `groups` field, which contains all Groups channels including label and value\n* `cell` field, which contains the column header label and value of the clicked cell For [geospatial charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/geo-spatial/#std-label-geo-spatial), the Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK click event handler captures click events for the following elements: * For [choropleth charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/choropleth/#std-label-choropleth-ref), the click event handler captures the fields that represent the channel data for the clicked element:  \n   * `lat` field, which contains latitude  \n   * `lng` field, which contains longitude  \n   * `location` field, which contains the field label and value of the clicked geospatial area\n* For [geospatial scatter charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/geospatial-scatter/#std-label-scatter-ref), the click event handler captures the fields that represent the channel data for the clicked element:  \n   * `geopoint` field, which contains the field name, value in GeoJSON format, and the coordinates of the

The filter object represents a single clicked item: * A string or unbinned number or date, which becomes an equality match query `({field: value})` or a query using `$eq`, `$ne`, `$in`, or `$nin` operators.\n* A binned number or date, which becomes a query using `gt`,`$gte`, `$lt`, or `lte` operators. Periodic dates are ignored. ## Example ```shell { field: 'value' } { field1: 'value1', field2: 'value2' } { field: { $in: [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] } } { field: { $nin: [ 'x', 'y', 'z' ] } } { field: { $gt: 10 } } { field: { $gt: 13, $lte: 30 } } { field: { $gt: Date(\"2020-01-01\"), $lt: Date(\"2020-03-31\") } } \n``` The `selectionFilter` document can have several key and value filters. For example, if a mark of a multi-series chart is clicked, the filter document contains both the category and series filter pairs. Each filter must reference the actual data source fields used and not their labels. You can enable highlighting for clicked events using the`setHighlight` method. ## Example ```shell const eventHandler = (payload) => {   chart.setHighlight(payload.selectionFilter); }; chart.render(container).then(() => {   chart.addEventListener('click', eventHandler); }); \n``` To learn more, see [Highlight Chart Elements.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/highlight-chart-elements/#std-label-highlight-chart-elements) On an embedded chart that includes event handlers with a filter for element roles, the chart shows: * The  when you hover over an element that triggers a filtered click event\n* The  when you hover over an element that doesn't trigger a click event If the event handler doesn't include filter for element roles, the appears when you hover over any chart element. ### `target` Element The `target` element of the [payload](#std-label-click-event-payload)contains information about the clicked target including: * The type of mark, such as `rect`, `line`, `arc`, `symbol`,`group`, or `area`\n* The role of mark, such as `mark`, `legend`, `axis-label`,`axis-title`, `tick-label`, `legend-entry`, `legend-title`, or `frame`\n* The fill color of the mark For [data tables](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/data-table/#std-label-data-table-ref), the Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK click event handler payload captures the following: * Mark type, which is `text`\n* Mark role, such as `group-cell`, `value-cell`,`dynamic-value-cell`, `row-total-cell`,`column-total-cell`, `header-column-total-cell`, and`grand-total-cell` For [geospatial charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/geo-spatial/#std-label-geo-spatial), the Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK click event handler payload captures the following: * The type of mark, such as `polygon`, `map`, or `symbol`\n* The role of mark, such as `mark` or `map`\n* The fill color of the mark The Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK click event handler does not capture click events on column headers. ## Examples The Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK includes examples that demonstrate common uses for click events in an application. The first example shows basic click events and payload handling. The second example shows interactive filtering of clicked chart elements. To learn more about installing the Embedding SDK and running the example app with your own data or sample data, see [MongoDB Charts Embedding Example for Click Events on GitHub](https://github.com/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/charts/click-events-basic).

Each time you click on an element in the chart, the click event listener refreshes the `payload` to reflect data from the `x` and`y` axis. When you click on an element that represents a specific genre and decade in the `Movie Genres` chart, the `Clicked Element`and `Full Event Payload` displays details on that movie genre and decade including: * Fields that represent data for the clicked element.\n* Mark type, role, and fill color. Refer to the example app to view the full event payload. ### Interactive Filtering for Click Events In the [example app](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/charts/click-events-filtering)for interactive filtering, when you click on an element on the `Movie Genres` chart, the embedding SDK generates a filter based on the element on which you clicked and then applies the filter to a second chart. In this example application, the chart shows: * The  when you hover over an interactive element\n* The  when you hover over an element which doesn't trigger a click event The click event listener triggers events only for the mark roles specified through the `options` parameter. The payload defines a filter based on the `y` axis, which represents the movie genres, and the lower and upper bound range, which represents the decade. Each time you click on an element that represents a specific genre and decade on the `Movie Genres` chart, the `Movie Details` data table is filtered by the clicked element and changes to display the movies available in that genre and decade.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Bin, Sort, and Limit Your Data On this page * [Bin Data](#bin-data)\n* [Sort Data](#sort-data)\n* [Limit Data](#limit-data) You can bin, sort, and limit data in your charts to highlight key aspects in your data. ## Bin Data MongoDB Charts supports binning date, numeric, and string fields in your data. Binning breaks continuous data into discrete groups called_bins_, with each bin containing a contiguous subset of the original values. For example, you might group users into bins by the decade they were born, or group timestamped calendar events by the month of their start date. ## Example ### Continuous vs Discrete Data Continuous data can occupy any value over a continuous range. Some examples of continuous data include height, temperature, or the time a person was born. Alternatively, discrete data is data which can only take certain values, categorized into a classification. Examples of discrete data include eye color and the number of students in a class. ## Sort Data Use the Sort By dropdown in the Chart Builder to sort chart data by either: * Category\n* Value\n* Series field (for [multi-series charts)](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/multi-series-charts/#std-label-multi-series-charts) If you sort a multi-series chart generically by Valuewithout sorting by a specific series, MongoDB Charts sorts your data based on the sum of all values in your series. To toggle between ascending or descending sort order, click the `a-z`button to the right of the Sort By dropdown. By default, Charts sorts data based on Valuein descending order. ### Sort Multi-Series Charts by Series Value If you create a [multi-series chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/multi-series-charts/#std-label-multi-series-charts) using a different field per series, you can sort the chart by a specific series field. ## Example The following charts use the[Sample Data: Movies](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/data-sources/#std-label-charts-sample-data)data source to compare the mean number of `fresh` and `rotten`Rotten Tomato ratings for movies in each genre. This chart is sorted by the mean `fresh` value in descending order: ![Chart sorted by fresh rating in descending order](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/sort-by-series-fresh-desc.png) This chart is sorted by the mean `rotten` value in ascending order: ![Chart sorted by rotten rating in ascending order](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/sort-by-series-rotten-asc.png) ## Limit Data You can apply a limit to the Category encoding channel to only include a specified number of categories in your visualization. The categories included are the _first_ matching categories based on the [sort order](#std-label-charts-sort-data) specified. Limiting data can be useful when visualizing data with so many categories it becomes difficult to create a meaningful chart. When you limit your data, you may additionally enableShow \"All Others\" to create a new category called \"All others\" that combines the values of categories omitted by your limit. ## Example The following chart shows the average[IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) rating of movies from a particular country: ![Movie ratings by country](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/charts-movie-ratings-by-country.png) The dataset contains movies from many different countries, but it would be most interesting to see which countries produce the highest-rated movies. We can accomplish this by applying a limit to only show countries with the 10 highest average ratings for movies. Switch the Limit Results toggle to `On` and leave theShow input at the default value of 10. Check Show \"All Others\" to create an 11th column representing the average rating of movies from countries that aren't in the top 10. The chart is now much easier to understand, and we have a clear view of the countries with the highest-rated movies: ![Movie ratings by country

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Backing Aggregation Pipeline To get the data needed to render a chart, Charts creates a MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline which is executed on the MongoDB database server. The pipeline consists of multiple stages, each of which is generated based on different settings specified by the chart's author. This document explains how the various Chart Builder settings are used to construct the Aggregation Pipeline. You can view the pipeline used to create a chart by choosing the View Aggregation Pipelineoption in the Chart Builder's ellipsis dropdown on the top right. The pipeline constructed by MongoDB Charts consists of the following segments in the following order: 1. [Charts views](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/create-manage-charts-view/#std-label-data-sources-pipeline)\n2. [Dashboard filters](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-filtering/#std-label-filter-dashboards)\n3. [Chart query](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-query-bar)\n4. [Embedding filters](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedded-chart-options/#std-label-embedded-chart-options)\n5. [Lookup fields](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/add-lookup-field/#std-label-add-lookup-field)\n6. [Calculated fields](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/calculated-fields/#std-label-calculated-fields)\n7. [Chart filters](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-charts-filter-documents)\n8. [Encoded fields](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels)\n9. [Sorting](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-sort-data)\n10. Maximum document limit ## Note You do not need to configure all of the above settings when creating a chart. Unspecified settings are skipped when generating the aggregation pipeline. ## Example The following chart shows the total sale amounts from an office supply company, categorized by purchase method. Each document in the data collection represents a single sale. Using this chart as an example, we will explore how the specifications for each of the above settings change the aggregation pipeline generated by MongoDB Charts. ![Aggregation pipline example without

Query: ```javascript {   $and: [   {     saleDate: { $gte: new Date(\"2017-01-01\") }   },   {     'items.4': { $exists: true }   } ] } \n``` Applying the above query in the Query bar generates the following chart and aggregation pipeline: ![Aggregation pipline example with query.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/agg-pipeline-query.png) Aggregation Pipeline: ```javascript 1 { 2   \"$match\": {              // Query 3     \"$and\": [ 4       { 5         \"saleDate\": { 6           \"$gte\": { 7             \"$date\": \"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z\" 8           } 9         } 10       }, 11       { 12         \"items.4\": { 13           \"$exists\": true 14         } 15       } 16     ] 17   } 18 }, 19 { 20   \"$addFields\": { 21     \"__alias_0\": { 22       \"$sum\": \"$items.price\" 23     } 24   } 25 }, 26 { 27   \"$group\": { 28     \"_id\": { 29       \"__alias_1\": \"$purchaseMethod\" 30     }, 31     \"__alias_0\": { 32       \"$sum\": \"$__alias_0\" 33     } 34   } 35 }, 36 { 37   \"$project\": { 38     \"_id\": 0, 39     \"__alias_1\": \"$_id.__alias_1\", 40     \"__alias_0\": 1 41   } 42 }, 43 { 44   \"$project\": { 45     \"x\": \"$__alias_1\", 46     \"y\": \"$__alias_0\", 47     \"_id\": 0 48   } 49 }, 50 { 51   \"$addFields\": { 52     \"__agg_sum\": { 53       \"$sum\": [ 54         \"$y\" 55       ] 56     } 57   } 58 }, 59 { 60   \"$sort\": { 61     \"__agg_sum\": -1 62   } 63 }, 64 { 65   \"$project\": { 66     \"__agg_sum\": 0 67   } 68 }, 69 { 70   \"$limit\": 5000 71 } \n``` The aggregation pipeline now starts with the query applied, and is followed by the groups selected in the Encode panel and the max document limit. ### Adding Calculated Fields We can also change the chart to show the total revenue generated categorized by purchase method. To accomplish this task, we will create a calculated field that calculates the total revenue by multiplying price by quantity. Adding this new calculated field, in addition to the query above, produces the following chart and pipeline: Calculated Field Expression: ![Aggregation pipline example with calculated

3 ### Check the connection status and disconnect the deployment. If the deployment connection status is Disconnected, the deployment is already disconnected from Charts. If the deployment connection status is Connected: 1. Click the disconnect icon  next to the deployment connection status. The Disconnect Deployment modal appears.\n2. Click Check for connected charts to learn whether any charts use the deployment's collections as a data source.\n3. Click Disconnect. The deployment disconnects from Charts. ## Disconnect a Data Source from MongoDB Charts Disconnect a data source from Charts to remove its data from your charts. If you disconnect a data source: * Any charts you built that use the data source no longer render and display an error.\n* Any charts that use [$lookup](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-lookup) to access data in the data source no longer render and display an error.\n* You can't use the data source to build new charts. You can also [disconnect a deployment.](#std-label-disconnect-deployment) If you disconnect a data source, you can [reconnect](#std-label-connect-data-source) it later to resume rendering charts that use its data. ## Note Charts automatically includes theSample Data: Movies data source in all Chartstenants. The [Sample Dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/#std-label-sample-dashboard) uses this data source to show the charts you can create. You can access the sample data source from all dashboards. You can't: * Add, edit, or delete the data in the Sample Data: Moviesdata source.\n* Remove the sample data source.\n* Externally share or [embed](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedding-charts/#std-label-embedding-charts) charts that use the sample data. To disconnect a data source from Charts: 1 ### In the left navigation menu, click Data Sources. The Data Sources page displays. 2 ### In the Deployment dropdown, select the deployment that contains your data source. Deployments in MongoDB Charts reference Atlas deployments that contain valid Charts data sources, including: * All [clusters and serverless instances](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlascreate-database-deployment/) in your Atlasproject for which you have the[Project Data Access Read Only](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Data-Access-Read-Only) role or higher.\n* All [federated database

[Filters for Embedded Documents](#filters-for-embedded-documents)\n* [Filter Data on Dashboards Embedded in an iframe](#filter-data-on-dashboards-embedded-in-an-iframe)\n* [Filter Syntax](#filter-syntax)\n* [Filter Data on Dashboards Embedded with the SDK](#filter-data-on-dashboards-embedded-with-the-sdk)\n* [Inject User-Specific Filters](#inject-user-specific-filters) You can customize your embedded dashboards by appending various query parameters to their iframe URLs or using the `filter` option with the Charts Embedding SDK. ## Specify Filterable Fields A dashboard [Author](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-permissions/#std-label-dashboard-roles) specifies the fields that can be included in filters set by the embedding application code or added by dashboard viewers. A dashboard author can limit access to data by allowing only certain fields to be filtered. By default, no fields are allowed, meaning the dashboard cannot be filtered until you explicitly allow at least one field. To define filterable fields: 1. For the desired [dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/#std-label-dashboards), click the button and select Embed from the dropdown.\n2. In the Allowed filter fields section, click the button.  \n## Note  \nThis option only appears if you already have **Unauthenticated**or **Authenticated** embedding access enabled.  \nYou can specify on which fields dashboard viewers can filter data by:  \n   * Using the dropdown to select the fields  \n   * Manually typing values to add fields not listed in the dropdown  \n   * Selecting Allow all fields in the data source used in this dashboard\n3. When you have selected all desired fields, click Savebelow the dropdown. Dashboard [viewers](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-permissions/#std-label-dashboard-roles) and applications which render the dashboard can now use filters based on the specified fields to display subsets of the original dashboard data. If a viewer attempts to use a filter for a field not included in the [Allowed filter fields](#std-label-specify-filter-fields-dashboards) list, MongoDB Charts returns an[error.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedded-chart-error-codes/#std-label-embedded-errors) ### Filters for Embedded Documents When you add a field to the Allowed filter fields list whose value is an embedded document, you must also specify each individual sub-field you want to allow. ## Example Consider the following document: `| {                   |\n| ------------------- |\n| \"name\": \"Alice\",    |\n| \"favorites\" :       |\n| {                   |\n| \"color\": \"green\",   |\n| \"animal\": \"turtle\", |\n| \"season\": \"autumn\"  |\n| }                   |\n| }                   | ` If you only add the `favorites` field to the list of allowed fields, it does _not_ grant viewers permission to filter upon any of the sub-fields of `favorites`. Instead, you may add one or more of the sub-fields to the list individually by specifying `favorites.color`,`favorites.animal`, or `favorites.season`. ## Filter Data on Dashboards Embedded in an

### Filter Syntax You can specify an MQL document as your `filter` query parameter provided that the fields used in your filter are in the [list of allowed filterable fields.](#std-label-specify-filter-fields-dashboards) Your filter must match the format used in a[$match](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/match/) query and be either a: * Top level query  \n## Example  \n```  \n{ \"quantity\": { $gte: 20 } }  \n```\n* Or within boolean expressions ([$and](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/and/),[$nor](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/nor/),[$or)](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/or/)  \n## Example  \n```  \n{ $or: [ { quantity: { $lt: 20 } }, { price: 10 } ] }  \n``` ## Note You must URL-encode special characters of the filter parameter. #### Example The following iframe `src` URL renders a dashboard which only displays documents with an `imdb.rating` greater than or equal to `8`: ``` https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-atlasproject1-piocy/embed/dashboards? id=93584ddb-1115-4a12-afd9-5129e47bbb0d& filter={\"imdb.rating\":%20{$gte:%208}} \n``` The URL uses an encoded `filter` parameter of`{\"imdb.rating\":%20{$gte:%208}}`. Decoded, this filter is: ``` {\"imdb.rating\": {$gte: 8}} \n``` ## Filter Data on Dashboards Embedded with the SDK You can add a [filter](#std-label-embed-options-filter-dashboards) to an embedded dashboard with the `filter` option. Filtering allows the dashboard author to only display data in the embedded dashboard which matches a specified MQL filter. In the Embed modal, you must specify any fields included in the filter. The Embed modal contains a dropdown menu of fields on which to allow filtering. The following uses the `filter` option to represent only documents in which the `total` field is greater than `100`: ```javascript createDashboard({   baseUrl: '<your-base-url>',   dashboardId: '<your-dashboard-id>',   width: 500,   height: 500,   filter: { \"total\": { \"$gt\": 100 } } }) \n``` ### Inject User-Specific Filters When you embed a dashboard that requires Authenticatedaccess, you can use the Injected function setting to inject a MongoDB filter document specific to each user who views the dashboard. The function has access to your Embedding Authentication Provider's token via `context.token`, and can filter the dashboard data based on the token. This filter ensures that viewers of an embedded dashboard only see their own data, which is useful when embedding dashboard with potentially sensitive information. ## Note If you use an Atlas App Services authentication provider, `context.token`contains the App Services[user object](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/authentication/user-objects/) to filter. For example, if you enable[Custom User Data](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/users/enable-custom-user-data/)for App Services users, the user object is available in`context.token.custom_data`. To inject a filter specific to each user, in theAuthenticated tab of the Embed dialog, set theInjected function\\`setting to :guilabel:\\`On. Specify a function and click Save. ## Example The following filter function only renders data where the`ownerId` field of a document matches the value of the Embedding Authentication Provider's

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Create a Single-Series Chart with Multiple Aggregations You can create a single-series chart that contains multiple aggregated values. These aggregated values can be from either the same field or different fields in your [data source](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/data-sources/#std-label-data-sources). Use this functionality to visualize multiple aggregated values without grouping your data into categories. ## Supported Chart Types You can include multiple aggregations in your single-series chart on the following chart types: * Grouped and Stacked [Bar Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref)\n* Grouped and Stacked [Column Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref)\n* Discrete [Line Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-line-area-chart-ref)\n* Discrete [Area Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-line-area-chart-ref) ## Procedure To create a single-series chart that contains multiple aggregated values: 1 ### In the Chart Builder, drag a field to the Aggregation encoding channel. 2 ### Select the desired aggregation for your field. 3 ### Drag an additional field to the empty Aggregation encoding channel that appears below the first. ## Note You can reuse the same field in multiple Aggregationencoding channels to perform different aggregations on the same field. 4 ### Select the desired aggregation for the next field. 5 ### Drag any additional fields you want to include in your chart into an empty Aggregation encoding channel and select their aggregation method. ## Behavior * When you encode multiple aggregation fields, the Seriesencoding channel is disabled.\n* When you create a single-series chart with only aggregated values, each aggregated value is treated as its own category. If you encode aCategory field in addition to your aggregation fields, the aggregated values become series (instead of categories). To learn more, see [Map Multiple Fields to a Single Axis.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/multi-series-charts/#std-label-multiple-field-mappings) ## Example The following chart uses the Sample Data: Moviesdata source to show the mean IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes ratings across all movies. ![Movie Ratings Multiseries Chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/single-series-multi-agg.png) The chart contains two aggregation encoding channels: * Mean `imdb.rating`\n* Mean `tomatoes.rating` Since no field is applied to the category encoding channel, the chart shows the mean ratings across all movies, irrespective of any categorical grouping. ← [Title and Description](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/title-description/ \"Previous Section\")[Create a Multi-Series

## Note If [Anyone with this link can view](#std-label-dashboard-access-link)sharing is enabled and you have `Author` or `Owner` permission, the icon doesn't change. ## Modify Dashboard Permissions ## Important To modify a dashboard's [permissions](#std-label-dashboard-roles), you must have the `Owner` role on that dashboard. To modify dashboard permissions, either click the click the[permission icon](#std-label-dashboard-permission-icons) at the top-right of the dashboard from the Dashboards page: ![Dashboard permission icon](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/dashboard-permission-icon.png) Or click the Share button at the top-right of the dashboard within the specific dashboard view: ![Dashboard access button](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/dashboard-share-button.png) With the Share Dashboard dialog open, read the following sections to learn how to grant permissions to a dashboard to: * [A specific user](#std-label-dashboard-specific-access)\n* [All users in your project](#std-label-dashboard-access-project)\n* [All users in your organization](#std-label-dashboard-access-org)\n* [Any user with your link](#std-label-dashboard-access-link) ### Specific User Permissions To give specific users permissions on the dashboard: 1. Select the Project tab.\n2. Search for the desired user using the search bar. You can search for users by their username or email address.\n3. Click the desired user to add them to the permissions list.\n4. Use the dropdown to the right of the user's name to assign the appropriate [permission.](#std-label-dashboard-roles)  \n## Important  \nMongoDB Charts displays a warning banner when the desired user can't access one or more data sources used on the dashboard. The user can't see any charts that use that data source.  \nA [Project Owner](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner) can assign the user a [project role](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#project-roles)with the access you want the user to have. To learn more about granting access, see [Modify Role Permissions for Data Sources.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-data-sources/#std-label-permission-model)\n5. Repeat these steps for each user you would like to provide dashboard permissions for.\n6. Click Close. MongoDB Charts saves your changes automatically. To remove permissions for a user, click the trash can icon to the right of the user's name. ### Access for All Users in a Project To allow access to the dashboard for all users in your Atlasproject: 1. Select the Project tab.\n2. Toggle the switch to the right of the Everyone user to `On`.\n3. Select the [permission](#std-label-dashboard-roles) to apply to allMongoDB Charts users.  \nA user's own permissions override others that could come from theEveryone setting.  \n## Example  \nIf Everyone has the Author permission and**Alice** has the Viewer permission, **Alice**'s effective permission is Viewer.  \n## Important  \nMongoDB Charts displays a warning banner whenEveryone in <Project Name> can't access one or more data sources used on the dashboard. A user might not see a chart that uses a data source to which the user wasn't granted access.  \nA [Project Owner](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner) can assign the user a [project role](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#project-roles)with the access you want the user to have. To learn more about granting access, see [Modify Role Permissions for Data Sources.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-data-sources/#std-label-permission-model)\n4. Click Close.

## Note If your organization uses a SSO provider, MongoDB Cloud prompts users in your organization sign to in through your provider to view the dashboard. Users who authenticate through your organization's SSO provider don't need an Atlas account. You can view all dashboards shared with your organization on theOrganization page. To open the Organizationpage, click Organization under the Dashboardsheading on the left navigation menu. ### Access for Users with a Link to the Dashboard If you want to view a dashboard using a public link, enable[Unauthenticated External Data Access](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-data-sources/#std-label-data-source-embedding)on each data source in the charts in the dashboard. To allow access to the dashboard for users on your MongoDB Chartsdeployment who have a direct link: 1. Select the Public tab.\n2. Toggle the switch on the right-side of thePublic user to `On`.  \nMongoDB Charts generates a public link with which anyone can view the dashboard. A user's permissions don't affect their ability to view a chart using a public link.  \n## Important  \nMongoDB Charts displays a warning banner when a[Project Owner](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner) hasn't enabled[Unauthenticated External Data Access](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-data-sources/#std-label-data-source-embedding). Users with the link won't be able to see the charts with the specified data source.  \nA [Project Owner](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Project-Owner) can change the settings to allow viewers of all [project roles](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#project-roles) to access the data. To learn more about granting access, see [Modify Role Permissions for Data Sources.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-data-sources/#std-label-permission-model)\n3. Click Close. MongoDB Charts saves your changes automatically. ## Warning ### Link Sharing with Sensitive Data Don't share links to dashboards that display sensitive data.

[Filter Data on Charts Embedded with the SDK](#filter-data-on-charts-embedded-with-the-sdk)\n* [Inject User-Specific Filters](#inject-user-specific-filters) You can customize your embedded charts by appending various query parameters to their iframe URLs or using the `filter` option with the Charts Embedding SDK. ## Note To embed charts from your dashboards, you must configure embedding options on your data sources. For instructions, see: * [Embed Charts in Your Web Application](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedding-charts/#std-label-embedding-charts) You can filter embedded charts and charts on[embedded dashboards.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedding-dashboards/#std-label-embedding-dashboards) ## Specify Filterable Fields A chart [Author](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-permissions/#std-label-dashboard-roles) specifies the fields that can be included in filters set by the embedding application code or added by chart viewers. A chart author can limit access to data by allowing only certain fields to be filtered. By default, no fields are allowed, meaning the chart cannot be filtered until you explicitly allow at least one field. To define filterable fields: 1. Navigate to the [dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/#std-label-dashboards) that contains the chart where you wish to define filterable fields.\n2. For the desired chart, click the  button and select Embed Chart from the dropdown.\n3. In the Allowed filter fields section, use the dropdown to select which fields chart viewers can use filter data in the chart. You can also manually type values to add fields not listed in the dropdown.  \n## Note  \nThis option only appears if you already have **Unauthenticated**or **Authenticated** embedding access enabled.  \nYou can specify on which fields chart viewers can filter data by:  \n   * Using the dropdown to select the fields  \n   * Manually typing values to add fields not listed in the dropdown  \n   * Selecting Allow all fields in the data source used in this chart\n4. When you have selected all desired fields, click Savebelow the dropdown. Chart [viewers](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-permissions/#std-label-dashboard-roles) and applications which render the chart can now use filters based on the specified fields to display subsets of the original chart data. If a viewer attempts to use a filter for a field not included in the [Allowed filter fields](#std-label-specify-filter-fields) list, MongoDB Charts returns an [error.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedded-chart-error-codes/#std-label-embedded-errors) ### Filters for Embedded Documents When you add a field to the Allowed filter fields list whose value is an embedded document, you must also specify each individual sub-field you want to allow. ## Example Consider the following document: `| {                   |\n| ------------------- |\n| \"name\": \"Alice\",    |\n| \"favorites\" :       |\n| {                   |\n| \"color\": \"green\",   |\n| \"animal\": \"turtle\", |\n| \"season\": \"autumn\"  |\n| }                   |\n| }

## Filter Data on Charts Embedded in an iframe Use the `filter` query parameter to only display data that matches a specified MQL filter in your chart embedded in an iframe. You can use the `filter` query parameter on bothUnauthenticatedand Verified Signature charts. The filtering behavior differs with each authentication setting: * With unauthenticated charts, the chart[Author](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-permissions/#std-label-dashboard-roles) specifies the fields that can be included in filters set by the embedding application code or added by chart viewers. To learn how to specify filterable fields, see[Specify Filterable Fields.](#std-label-specify-filter-fields)\n* With charts which require a Verified Signature, all document fields can be filtered upon, however you must generate the filter in the server-side code and include the filter as part of your signed payload. ### Filter Syntax Select the appropriate tab to see an example of how to filter data in an Unauthenticated chart and aVerified Signature chart: ## Filter Data on Charts Embedded with the SDK You can add a [filter](#std-label-embed-options-filter) to an embedded chart with the `filter` option. Filtering allows the chart author to only display data in the embedded chart which matches a specified MQL filter. In the Embed Chart modal, you must specify any fields included in the filter. The Embed Chart modal contains a dropdown menu of fields on which to allow filtering. The following uses the `filter` option to represent only documents in which the `total` field is greater than `100`: ```javascript createChart({   baseUrl: '<your-base-url>',   chartId: '<your-chart-id>',   width: 500,   height: 500,   filter: { \"total\": { \"$gt\": 100 } } }) \n``` ### Inject User-Specific Filters When you embed a chart that requires Authenticated access, you can use the Injected function setting to inject a MongoDB filter document specific to each user who views the chart. The function has access to your Embedding Authentication Provider's token via `context.token`, and can filter the chart data based on the token. This filter ensures that viewers of an embedded chart see only their own data, which is useful when embedding charts with potentially sensitive information. ## Note If you use an Atlas App Services authentication provider, `context.token`contains the App Services[user object](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/authentication/user-objects/) to filter. For example, if you enable[Custom User Data](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/users/enable-custom-user-data/)for App Services users, the user object is available in`context.token.custom_data`. To inject a filter specific to each user, in theAuthenticated tab of the Embed Chartdialog, set the Injected functionsetting to On. Specify a function and clickSave. ## Example The following filter function only renders data where the`ownerId` field of a document matches the value of the Embedding Authentication Provider's token's `sub` field: ```javascript function getFilter(context) {   return { ownerId: context.token.sub }; } \n``` ← [Embedded Chart Options](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedded-chart-options/ \"Previous

who want to view embedded charts or dashboards that require authentication. Charts doesn't render the chart or dashboard in any of the following scenarios: * The details in the token don't match criteria you specify.\n* The token is invalid.\n* A token isn't present. ## Considerations * You must be an Atlas [Project Owner](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#project-roles) to configure embedding authentication providers for your linkedCharts instance.\n* Charts supports these authentication providers:  \n   * [Atlas App Services](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/authentication/)  \n   * Google  \n   * Custom JWT ### Atlas App Services Providers Charts considers tokens from App Services providers valid if they: * Are syntactically valid JWTs.\n* Are issued by the relevant authority.\n* Match the App Services App ID you configure the provider to accept. ### Google Providers Charts considers tokens from Google providers valid if they: * Are syntactically valid JWTs.\n* Are issued by the relevant authority.\n* Match the Google Client ID you configure the provider to accept. ### JWT Providers Charts considers tokens from JWT providers valid if they: * Contain an expiration time claim with a time and date in the future.  \n## Note  \nYour application must handle refreshing tokens before they expire.\n* Contain an issued at time claim with a time and date in the past.\n* Have a token lifetime of less than or equal to one hour. The token lifetime is the difference between the issued at time claim and the expiration time claim.  \n## Example  \nCharts rejects a token containing the following claims because the token lifetime of one year is too long:  \n`| {                    |  \n| -------------------- |  \n| \"iat\": \"1587497399\", |  \n| \"exp\": \"1617305399\"  |  \n| }                    |  \n`  \nCharts can accept a token containing the following claims because the token lifetime of one hour is acceptable:  \n```  \n{  \n  \"iat\": \"1585769399\",  \n  \"exp\": \"1585772999\"  \n}  \n```\n* Are signed using either the `HS256` or `RS256` signing algorithm.\n* Are signed with a key that can be verified by the secret you provide when you configure the custom JWT authentication provider.\n* Contain an audience claim that matches the one you specified when you configure the provider, if applicable. ## Procedures ### View Authentication Providers To view the embedding authentication providers you have configured: 1 #### Go to the Authentication Settings view. 1.

Click the Authentication Settings tab. 2 #### From the Embedding providers section, click Edit next to the provider you want to modify. 3 #### Modify the values that Charts uses to verify tokens from the provider. See [Add an Authentication Provider](#std-label-add-auth-provider-steps) for the values you can modify for the provider type you configured. 4 #### Click Save. ### Delete an Authentication Provider To delete an embedding authentication provider: 1 #### Go to the Authentication Settings view. 1. If Charts is not already displayed, clickCharts in the navigation bar.\n2. Click Embedding in the sidebar.\n3. Click the Authentication Settings tab. 2 #### From the Embedding providers section, click Delete next to the provider you want to delete. 3 #### Click Delete to confirm. ## Important After you delete a provider, all embedded charts that the deleted provider authenticated no longer render. ### Generate an Embedding Key ## Note Only users with the [Project Owner](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#project-roles) role can see this section. ## Important Embedding keys are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use [Embedding Authentication Providers](#std-label-configure-auth-providers) and the [Embedding SDK](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/embedding-charts-sdk/) instead. Embedding keys are necessary for generating and verifying digital signatures of charts embedded using the Verified Signature\\`mode. To generate a new embedding key, click the Generate New Keybutton on the right side of the page. ## Warning If you generate a new key, any previous keys become invalid.

chart. You can either use: * The [Filter Tab's](#std-label-filter-tab) numeric, string, date, or boolean fields to handle most of your data filtering needs.\n* The [Query Bar](#std-label-query-bar) to filter your data using more complex queries, such as logical operator queries, or process raw data by using the aggregation pipeline. To learn how to filter results across multiple charts on your dashboard, see[Filter Dashboards by Field Values.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-filtering/#std-label-dashboard-filtering) ## Create Filters for Your Data The chart builder contains a filter tab where you can drag and drop fields to specify filters for your data. To filter data using the filter tab: 1. Click the center tab in the chart builder:  \n![Image showing how to access filter tab](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/filter-tab.png)\n2. Drag a field from the Fields on the left to theChart Filters section of the tab. The data type of the selected field determines the available filtering options. You can filter fields with the following data types: ## Note You cannot use the same field in multiple filters. ### Enable or Disable a Filter You can toggle whether a filter in the Filter tab is enabled or disabled. Disabled filters do not affect the documents which appear in the chart. Disabled filters are grayed out and cannot be edited until they are enabled. To toggle whether a filter is enabled, hover over a filter and set the toggle that appears at the top of the filter to the desired setting. ![Image showing filter toggle](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/filter-tab-disable-toggle.png) ### Expand or Collapse a Filter You can expand or collapse chart filter cards by clickingShow or Hide on that card. Disabled filters are automatically collapsed. Enabled, collapsed filters are still applied to your charts. ## Filter Your Data Using the Query Bar The Query bar above the chart display supports more complex queries than the filter panel. Additionally, you can use the query bar to create[aggregation pipelines](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/) to process your data before it is rendered. To filter data using the Query bar: 1. In the Query bar, input a filter document. Use the same syntax used in the query portion of the[db.collection.find()](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/) method. Your filter document must be in curly brackets.\n2. Click Apply. The following tabs show how to construct queries with the following operators: * `$or` logical operator to match documents where at least one clause is true\n* `$exists` query operator to match documents with an element that exists\n* `$regex` query operator to match documents with a regular expression\n* `Date` field to match documents with specific dates ### Address Query Errors If your query is invalid, Charts displays the icon in the Query bar. Click the Query bar if it is not already displayed to view error details. Charts displays error details for: * Client-side errors, such as malformed JSON, and\n* Server-side errors, such as invalid MQL. ![Example Filter

charts on your dashboard, you can arrange them for maximum legibility. These two charts are horizontally oriented, so you may wish to make them wider and stack them one above the other. You can change the shape of each chart by clicking and dragging on the lower right corner of the chart, and you can move them around the page by clicking and dragging on the upper left corner of the chart. ## Tip ### See also:  [Manage Existing Dashboards](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-dashboards/#std-label-manage-existing-dashboards) Your finished dashboard should look similar to this: ![Finished Tutorial Dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/movie-tutorial-dashboard-final.png) ## Wrapping Up You now have a dashboard which provides easily accessible insight into award winning directors and award nominated films.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Column Chart Showing Directors with the Most Awards _Estimated Time to Complete: 5 minutes_ To create each chart, you will populate the chart's[encoding channels](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels) with fields from your schema. [Encoding channels](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels) represent the information passed to MongoDB Charts which allows Charts to create the visualization. ## Construct the Chart To discover which directors of films represented in this dataset have won the most awards, use the `directors` and `awards.wins` database fields in your chart. The `genres` field provides additional insight into the specific genres of the films for which these directors have won awards. A [column chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref) makes it easy to sort and compare fields with numerical values, so it is a good choice for this use case. 1 ### Click Add Chart. 2 ### Select the `sample_mflix.movies` data source. In the Select Data Source modal that appears: 1. Click the Project tab.\n2. Click the name of the deployment that contains the sample data source.\n3. Click the `sample_mflix` database. The database's data sources appear.\n1. Click Select on the `movies` data source. 3 ### Select the Chart Type. 1. In the Chart Type dropdown menu, selectColumn.\n2. Select the panel labeled Stacked below the Chart Type dropdown menu. 4 ### Add the desired fields to the proper encoding channels. 1. Drag the `directors` field from the Fieldssection of the Chart Builder view to the X Axisencoding channel.\n2. In the `directors` Array Reductions dropdown, select Unwind Array.\n3. In the Fields section click the `awards` field to expand the `awards` object and view its properties.\n4. Drag the `awards.wins` field to the Y Axisencoding channel. The Y Axis encoding channel determines which field to use for the chart's[aggregation.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/)\n5. Leave the Aggregate dropdown menu for theY Axis encoding channel on its default value of sum. This value directs the aggregation operation to return the total number of award wins for each director. ## Example ### Aggregation [Aggregation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manualaggregation/) processes data records using a wide variety of methods and returns computed results which may not be available in the original dataset. Because we are interested in the total number of awards won by each director, we use the `awards.wins` field here and will use an aggregation operator which will allow us to add up the total wins for each director. 5 ### Apply a limit to the X axis. At this point there are too many columns in our X axis to show any meaningful results. To bring the number down to a manageable level, we'll apply a [limit](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-limit-data) to get the ten directors with the most award wins. The `directors` array is already sorted by the aggregated value of `wins` in descending order. To apply a limit to the number of columns in the X Axis: 1. Toggle Limit Results to On.\n2. Set Show to `10`. 6 ### Group awards by genre. 1. Drag the `genres` field to the Series encoding channel.\n2. In the Array Reductions dropdown menu, select`unwind array`. The X axis columns are now broken down by movie genre.  \n## Note  \nSome movies contain more than one genre, so the numbers shown in the columns may not be the exact number of awards for each

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Area Chart Showing Age Distribution of Customers _Time to Complete: 5 minutes_ In the final chart of the dashboard, highlight some of the customer analytic information available in the schema using an[area chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-line-area-chart-ref). By visualizing the age range and distribution of store customers, you can ensure that any advertising the store performs is directed where it will be seen by the most potential buyers. ## Construct the Chart 1 ### At the top-right corner of the dashboard, click Add Chart. 2 ### Select the `sample_supplies.sales` data source. In the Select Data Source modal that appears: 1. Click the Project tab.\n2. Click the name of the deployment that contains the sample data source.\n3. Click the `sample_supplies` database. The database's data sources appear.\n1. Click Select on the `sales` data source. 3 ### Select the Chart Type 1. In the Chart Type dropdown, selectArea.\n2. Click Discrete below the dropdown. ## Example ### Area Chart An area chart is a good choice to easily visualize the ages where customers are the most concentrated. Since you are not concerned with exact values in this scenario but rather general trends, an area chart makes more sense than a line chart because the filled-in visualization allows us to more easily identify the most common age ranges. We use a discrete area chart, rather than continuous, because we are ultimately looking for a count of the customers in each particular age bracket determined by the chart's[bin size](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data). Discrete charts allow us to perform aggregation operations on the data, whereas in a continuous chart each data point must come from a distinct document. 4 ### Add the desired fields to the proper encoding channels. 1. In the Fields section click the `customer` field to expand the `customer` object and view its properties.\n2. Drag the `customer.age` field to the X Axisencoding channel. The X Axis encoding channel dictates which field to display on the horizontal axis.\n3. Set the Bin Size to `5`.  \n## Example  \n### Data Binning  \nBinning data groups continuous data into bins of a specified size. In this case, rather than plotting points for each individual age in the dataset, the data is grouped into bins of `5` ages. This provides a clearer look into the overall trend of the age distribution.  \nFor more information on data binning, see the[Data Binning](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data) section.\n4. Drag the `_id` field to the Y Axisencoding channel. The Y Axis encoding channel determines which field to use for the chart's[aggregation.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/)  \n## Example  \n### Y Axis Encoding Channel  \nBecause we will be performing a [$count](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/count/) aggregation on the documents, it does not matter what field we use for this encoding channel because the chosen field does not affect the number of documents in each bin.\n5. In the Y Axis Aggregate dropdown, selectcount. This option counts the occurrence of each customer age from each sale and adds it to the visualization after placing it in the appropriate bin. Your chart should now look something like this: ![Area Chart Builder](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/tutorial-area-in-progress-2.png) Customers appear to be mostly between the ages `40-45`. This is where the largest area region in the chart occurs. Additionally, the rest of the ages appear to be[normally distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal%5Fdistribution), meaning the average customer age is at the center of the area chart and there are the same number of younger and older customers.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Scatter Chart of Award-Nominated Movies with Their TomatoMeter Rating _Estimated Time to Complete: 5 minutes_ ## Construct the Chart Next, add a chart to your dashboard showing the TomatoMeter rating and MPAA rating of movies with the most award nominations. A[scatter chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/scatter-chart/#std-label-scatter-chart-ref) is a good choice for visualizing how data points cluster together around certain values and allows the representation of several different data dimensions. 1 ### Click Add Chart. The Add Chart button is in the top right corner of the dashboard. 2 ### Select the `sample_mflix.movies` data source. In the Select Data Source modal that appears: 1. Click the Project tab.\n2. Click the name of the deployment that contains the sample data source.\n3. Click the `sample_mflix` database. The database's data sources appear.\n1. Click Select on the `movies` data source. 3 ### Select the Chart Type. 1. In the Chart Type dropdown, selectGrid.\n2. Select the Scatter panel below the dropdown menu. 4 ### Add the desired fields to the proper encoding channels. 1. In the Fields section, click the `tomatoes` field to expand the `tomatoes` object and view its properties.\n2. Click the `tomatoes.critic` field to also expand that object.\n3. Drag the `tomatoes.critic.rating` field to the X Axis [encoding channel.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels)\n4. In the Fields section click the `awards` field to expand the `awards` object and view its properties.\n5. Drag the `awards.nominations` field to the Y Axisencoding channel. 5 ### Add a query filter. You can see now that higher-rated movies have a higher density of awards, but the chart is rather noisy. Add a query filter to only include movies with at least 30 award nominations and marginal MPAA ratings. 1. In the Filters box, add the following query filter and click the Apply button:  \n`| {\"awards.nominations\": {$gte: 30}, rated: {$in: [\"G\", \"PG\", \"PG-13\", \"R\"]}} |  \n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  \n` 6 ### Differentiate the chart by MPAA rating. In the Fields section, drag the `rated` field to the Color [encoding channel.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels) ## Example ### Additional Data Options There are three options for adding more data to your chart. You can use any of your data fields to modify the size, color, and shape of the markers on the grid. The `rated` field works well here because it has low cardinality; there are only four possible values (`G`, `PG`, `PG-13`, and `R`). Fields with higher cardinality may make the chart too noisy to read. 7 ### Title your chart. 1. Hover over your chart title above the center of the chart and click the pencil icon.\n2. Copy the following into the chart title input:  \n```  \nMovies with Most Awards Nominations, by MPAA Rating  \n```\n3. Click the check mark to save your title.\n4. Your chart should now look like this:  \n![Movies with the most awards by rating](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/tutorial2-most-awards-by-rating.png)\n5. Click Save and Close to return to your dashboard. ## Next Steps Follow along to the next section of the tutorial to see how we can[rearrange the charts on the

Contents](#table-of-contents) _Total Estimated Time to Complete: 20-30 minutes_ ## Introduction This tutorial explores features and capabilities of MongoDB Charts with a [data source](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/data-sources/) containing the `Mflix` [sample data provided by Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/). This sample data contains information on movies such as release year, cast, and reviews. With this tutorial, you will learn how to use filters to refine a large result set down to an easily understandable chart, and use multi-series charts to gain further insight into the data. In this tutorial, you'll create two charts: a sorted column chart and a scatter chart. * The [sorted column chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/tutorial/movie-details/column-chart-director-awards/#std-label-movie-details-column)displays columns representing the number of awards won by directors with at least 50 total awards, sorted from highest to lowest and broken down by film genre.\n* The [scatter chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/tutorial/movie-details/scatter-chart-movies-ratings/#std-label-movie-details-scatter) shows a diagram of movies with at least one award win along with their TomatoMeter rating and their MPAA rating (G, PG, PG-13, or R). ![Finished Tutorial Dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/movie-tutorial-dashboard-final.png) ## Table of Contents *

the top row with plenty of empty space below. You can make the display easier to digest by rearranging and resizing some of the charts. Charts makes this a straight-forward process by providing simple drag and drop capabilities for reorganizing a dashboard. ## Instructions You can rearrange charts by dragging the top-left corner of the chart, and resize charts by dragging the bottom-right corner. For additional details on rearranging and resizing charts, see the[Manage Existing Dashboards](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-dashboards/#std-label-manage-existing-dashboards) section. Try reorganizing your dashboard to get something like this: ![Organized Dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/order-tutorial-dashboard-organized.png) ## Next Steps In the last chart of the dashboard, we will explore some of the customer data available in the schema to create an[area chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/tutorial/order-data/area-chart-age-distribution/#std-label-order-data-area-chart) showing the age distribution of customers. ← [Grouped Column Chart Showing Most

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Column Chart Showing Total Sales by Store Location _Time to Complete: 5 minutes_ Looking at the data fields available in the schema, some of the most valuable information you can relay revolves around revenue. You may want to know how various stores are performing, specifically if there are any stores significantly under or overperforming compared to others. A [column chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref) works well for this type of visualization because you can easily compare individual store revenue based on the size of each column. ## Construct the Chart 1 ### Click Add Chart. 2 ### Select the `sample_supplies.sales` data source. In the Select Data Source modal that appears: 1. Click the Project tab.\n2. Click the name of the deployment that contains the sample data source.\n3. Click the `sample_supplies` database. The database's data sources appear.\n1. Click Select on the `sales` data source. 3 ### Select the Chart Type 1. In the Chart Type dropdown, selectColumn.\n2. Click Stacked below the dropdown. ## Example ### Column Chart This chart renders a column for each store location's revenue. Because there are six different store locations, the chart will contain six columns. 4 ### Add the desired fields to the proper encoding channels. 1. Drag the `storeLocation` property from the Fieldssection of the Chart Builder view to the X Axisencoding channel. This tells MongoDB Charts to create a column for each `storeLocation` value in the dataset.\n2. In the Fields section click the `items` field to expand the `items` object and view its properties.  \n## Note  \nMongoDB Charts infers the data type of each field and provides symbols to easily determine these data types when building your chart. For example, the calendar icon next to the `saleDate` field signifies that this field is a timestamp. These symbols can help ensure your chart renders as expected by using proper data types for each[encoding channel.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels)\n3. Drag the `items.price` field to the Y Axisencoding channel. The Y Axis encoding channel determines which field to use for the chart's[aggregation.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/)  \n## Example  \n### Aggregation  \n[Aggregation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manualaggregation/) processes data records using a wide variety of methods and returns computed results which may not be available in the original dataset. Because we are interested in the total revenue from each store, we use the `items.price` field here and will use an aggregation operator which will allow us to add the `items.price` fields together.\n4. In the Array Reductions dropdown, selectUnwind array.  \n## Example  \n### Unwind array  \nArray reductions dictate how to process an array so its elements can be visualized. The unwind arrayoption creates a new document for each element in the array, so each item's price is added to the total for that store.  \nFor more information on unwinding arrays, refer to the[unwind aggregation documentation.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/)\n5. In the Aggregate dropdown, select sum.  \n## Example  \n### Sum  \nThis option adds the prices of all items per store together to display the chart. For more information on the `$sum`aggregation command, refer to the[sum aggregation documentation.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sum/) Your chart should now look something like this: ![Stacked Bar Chart Builder](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/tutorial-stacked-bar-in-progress-2.png) Notice that the stores generating the most revenue are the`Denver` and `Seattle` locations. 5 ### Title your chart. 1. Hover over your chart title above the center of the chart and click the pencil icon.\n2. Copy the following into the chart title input:  \n`| Total Sales ($) by Store Location |  \n| --------------------------------- |  \n`\n3.

Atlas Cluster](#load-the-sample-data-into-your-service-cluster)\n* [Next Steps](#next-steps) _Time to Complete: 8 minutes_ ## Prerequisites To complete this tutorial you will need a[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) cluster. Refer to the [Create a Cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/create-new-cluster/) documentation for instructions on creating an Atlas cluster. ## Load the Sample Data into Your Atlas Cluster Atlas provides sample data you can load into your Atlascluster. To load sample data into your cluster: 1 ### Log in to Atlas. Log in to your Atlas account at [https://cloud.mongodb.com.](https://cloud.mongodb.com) 2 ### Navigate to your Atlas Database Deployments view. Click Database in the sidebar. 3 ### Load the sample dataset. 1. Click the Ellipses (...) button for your cluster.\n2. Click Load Sample Dataset. Atlas begins loading your sample data. This operation takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. Charts automatically connects to the supply store collection as a [data source.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/data-sources/#std-label-data-sources) ## Next Steps Now that you have loaded the sample data, you can [Create a New Dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/tutorial/order-data/create-new-dashboard/#std-label-order-data-new-dash) which will use this data source to create

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Donut Chart Showing Most Common Tags for Items Sold _Time to Complete: 5 minutes_ Next we will add a chart where you can quickly see which types of items the company is selling the most of. This information will be helpful for the company marketing team to know how effectively direct advertising. In this scenario, your manager has expressed interest specifically in items sold from the `Denver` and `New York` store locations. Additionally, they have requested to only visualize sales which contain an item costing `$1200` or more, in an effort to more closely examine the new line of laptops being sold at these locations and what types of items are being bought with them. You can accomplish this using a [filter](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-charts-filter-documents) in your[donut chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/donut-chart/#std-label-donut-chart-ref), as shown in the following procedure. ## Construct the Chart 1 ### At the top-right corner of the dashboard, click Add Chart. 2 ### Select the `sample_supplies.sales` data source. In the Select Data Source modal that appears: 1. Click the Project tab.\n2. Click the name of the deployment that contains the sample data source.\n3. Click the `sample_supplies` database. The database's data sources appear.\n1. Click Select on the `sales` data source. 3 ### Select the Chart Type 1. In the Chart Type dropdown, selectCircular.\n2. Click Donut below the dropdown. ## Example ### Donut Chart A donut chart is a good choice for this chart because donut charts show the relationship of parts to a whole. Using this chart type you can easily get an idea of which tags make up the greatest portion of total sales. 4 ### Add the desired fields to the proper encoding channels. 1. In the Fields section click the `items` field to expand the `items` object and view its properties.\n2. Drag the `items.tags` field to the Labelencoding channel. The Label encoding channel dictates which field to use when dividing the sections of the chart.\n3. In the array reduction dropdown for the`items` array select Unwind array.\n4. In the array reduction dropdowns for the`tags` select Array element by index. Using this option you can specify which element of the `tags` array to visualize.\n5. Enter `0` for the Index input to only visualize the first element of the `tags` array. The first item tag is the most relevant tag to the item, so it should be the main concern in the visualiztion. This is the _primary_ item tag.  \n## Note  \nSelecting an array element by index also ensures the chart does not get overcrowded with less important tags as it would had you chosen to unwind the `tags` array rather than select a specific element.\n6. Drag the `id` field to the Arcencoding channel.\n7. In the Aggregate dropdown, select count. This option counts the occurrences of the first tag of each item and adds them to the chart. Your chart should now look something like this: ![Donut Chart Builder](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/tutorial-donut-in-progress-2.png) 5 ### Copy the following filter into the Query input above the main chart display. `| { storeLocation: { $in: [ \"Denver\", \"New York\" ] }, 'items.price': {$gte: 1200} } |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ` This [filter](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-charts-filter-documents) specifies thatCharts only visualizes item tags from items sold from either the `Denver` or `New York` store location where there was an item in the sale costing `$1200` or more. 6 ### Click Apply to the right of the filter. Your chart should now look something like this: ![Edit Chart Add Filter](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/order-tutorial-edit-add-filter-2.png) Notice how the `electronics` tag now takes a larger slice of the distribution compared to when not using the filter.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Grouped Column Chart Showing Most Common Items Sold by Store Location _Time to Complete: 5 minutes_ By visualizing which items are sold most commonly at each store, you can help ensure each store is properly stocked with the items they are most likely to sell out of. A grouped[column chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref) creates a group within the chart for each store location and display columns within each group reflecting the relative sales of each item. ## Construct the Chart 1 ### At the top-right corner of the dashboard, click Add Chart. 2 ### Select the `sample_supplies.sales` data source. In the Select Data Source modal that appears: 1. Click the Project tab.\n2. Click the name of the deployment that contains the sample data source.\n3. Click the `sample_supplies` database. The database's data sources appear.\n1. Click Select on the `sales` data source. 3 ### Select the Chart Type 1. In the Chart Type dropdown, selectColumn.\n2. Click Grouped below the dropdown. 4 ### Add the desired fields to the proper encoding channels. 1. Drag the `storeLocation` field to the X Axisencoding channel. The X Axis encoding channel dictates which field to use when creating the column groups.  \n## Example  \n### X Axis Encoding Channel  \nUsing `storeLocation` for this encoding channel allows us to visualize a group of items per store location.\n2. In the Fields section click the `items` field to expand the `items` object and view its properties.\n3. Drag the `items.name` field to the Y Axisencoding channel. The Y Axis encoding channel determines which field to use for the chart's[aggregation.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/)  \n## Example  \n### Y Axis Encoding Channel  \nUsing `items.name` for this encoding channel allows us to aggregate and count the items sold in each location.\n4. In the Array Reductions dropdown, selectUnwind array.\n5. In the Aggregate dropdown, select count.  \n## Example  \n### Count  \nThe count option counts the occurrences of each item name after unwinding the `items` array and displays them in the chart grouped by store location.  \nFor more information on the `$count` aggregation command, refer to the[count aggregation documentation.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/count/)\n6. Drag the `items.name` field to the Series encoding channel.  \n## Example  \n### Series Encoding Channel  \nThe Series encoding channel dictates how to split each group of the chart. Each member of the series becomes a column within the group, so each item name becomes a column within the store location group.\n7. In the Series Array Reductions dropdown, selectUnwind array. Your chart should now look something like this: ![Grouped Column Chart Builder](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/tutorial-grouped-column-in-progress-2.png) The item sales look to be fairly evenly distributed by store location. Notice based on this chart that `notepads` are the most common item sold at all store locations, which is useful information when stocking each store with its inventory. 5 ### Title your chart. 1. Hover over your chart title and click the pencil icon.\n2. Copy the following into the title input:  \n`| Most Common Items Sold by Store Location |  \n| ---------------------------------------- |  \n`\n3. Click the check mark to save your title. 6 ### Click Save and Close at the top-left of the chart builder view. Your dashboard should now look something like this: ![Order Tutorial Dashboard Stage 3](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/order-tutorial-dashboard-stage3.png) ## Next Steps Now that we have a few charts the dashboard is starting to get a bit crowded. Follow along to the next section of the tutorial to see how we can [rearrange and resize](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/tutorial/order-data/rearrange-resize/#std-label-order-data-rearrange-resize)

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Create a New Dashboard _Time to Complete: 3 minutes_ ## Instructions Now that you have created your data source, create a dashboard to hold all of your visualizations: 1. Click Dashboards in the sidebar.\n2. Click the New Dashboard button.\n3. Copy the following into the Title input:  \n`| Super Supply Store Orders |  \n| ------------------------- |  \n`\n1. Copy the following into the Description input:  \n```  \nSales, Customer Analytics, and More.  \n```\n2. Click Create. After clicking create, Charts navigates you to your newly created dashboard and prompts you to add your first chart. ## Next Steps The following sections of the tutorial walk through[building each chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/) for your dashboard. You will be populating the dashboard with the following visualizations: * A [column chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/tutorial/order-data/column-chart-sales-by-store/#std-label-order-data-column-chart) for total sales by store location\n* A [donut chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/tutorial/order-data/donut-chart-item-tags/#std-label-order-data-donut-chart) showing the frequencies of tags occurring in each item sold\n* A [grouped column chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/tutorial/order-data/grouped-column-items-sold/#std-label-order-data-grouped-column) showing the most common items sold in each store location\n* An [area chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/tutorial/order-data/area-chart-age-distribution/#std-label-order-data-area-chart) showing a distribution of customer ages To create each chart, you will populate the chart's[encoding channels](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels) with fields from your schema. Encoding channels represent the information passed toMongoDB Charts which allows Charts to create the visualization. For more information on encoding channels and the different types of channels available, refer to the[encoding channels section](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels) of the documentation. Follow along to the next section of the tutorial to build a[column chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/tutorial/order-data/column-chart-sales-by-store/#std-label-order-data-column-chart) showing

Bug fixes in this release: * Fixes an issue where injected embedding filters were not properly considered when retrieving chart data from the cache.\n* Fixes an issue where errors that occurred while sampling fields did not display in the chart builder.\n* Fixes an issue where the chart builder query bar did not appear dimmed when a dialog was open.\n* Changes the IFrame embedding parameter to `autoRefresh` to improve consistency with SDK property (the previous `autorefresh` syntax still works).\n* Fixes an issue where embedded charts sometimes rendered with the incorrect font. ## MongoDB

## MongoDB Charts v1.8.0 _Released November 11, 2019_ Improvements in this release: * Add [Missed Fields](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-missing-fields) and[Calculated fields](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/calculated-fields/#std-label-calculated-fields) while building a chart.\n* Share dashboards via a [public link.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-permissions/#std-label-dashboard-access-link)\n* New design for [Data Source Permissions](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/manage-data-sources/#std-label-permission-model) and[Dashboard Permissions](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-permissions/#std-label-dashboard-permissions) dialogs.

## MongoDB Charts v1.1.1 _Released Feb 14, 2019_ Improvements in this release: * New Chart Types:  \n   * [100% Stacked Bar](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref)  \n   * [100% Stacked Column](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref)  \n   * [100% Stacked Area](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-line-area-chart-ref)\n* New default [sort behavior](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-sort-data) in charts.\n* New [filter bar](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-charts-filter-documents) in the chart builder, with increased performance and usability. Bug fixes in this release: * Changes to [filter parsing](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-filter-tab) to better align with MongoDB Shell syntax and Javascript in general. Specifically, filters using `Date()` to represent the current date or`Date(\"2019-01-01\")` to represent a specific date will need to be changed to `new Date()` or `ISODate()` and`new Date(\"2019-01-01\")` or `ISODate(\"2019-01-01\")`, since the Date() function now correctly returns the date as a string representation.\n* Fixed rendering issues in certain browser versions relating to the[continuous color picker.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/general-customization/#std-label-color-palette-customization)\n* Miscellaneous performance, reliability and security

Labels](#resize-labels)\n* [Customize Legend](#customize-legend) MongoDB Charts provides general customization options which modify the visualization at a high level, rather than individual pieces of the visualization. ## Note This page illustrates the general customization options which are available for most [chart types](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-types/#std-label-chart-type-reference). Some chart types have other customization options which are noted on their individual documentation pages. To access the general customization options, expand the Generalsection of the Customize tab. ![Field level customizations](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/general-custom.png) ## Color Palette Customization Palette customization allows you to select custom colors for your chart. To enable color customization, select theCustomize tab of the Chart Type column. A toggle switch labeled Custom Color Palette appears in the General section. You can also customize individual colors in your palette. Most chart types use a custom color picker with color swatches that correspond to your data series. ![Custom color palette selection](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/custom-color-palette.png) Depending on the chart type, each color swatch has a corresponding number or a corresponding name: * Single-series charts have a single numbered swatch.\n* Multi-series charts built by[mapping multiple fields](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/multi-series-charts/#std-label-multiple-field-mappings)have color swatches with the names of your selected fields.\n* Multi-series charts built with a numeric or date field in the[Series channel](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/multi-series-charts/#std-label-charts-series-encoding) have numbered color swatches.\n* Multi-series charts built with a string field in the[Series channel](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/multi-series-charts/#std-label-charts-series-encoding) allow you to choose how you want to assign color. For numbered color swatches, select the By Order option. For swatches with field names, select the By Series option. To change the color of the corresponding data series, click the color swatch. You can select a new color with a color slider, by entering a hex value, by entering RGB values, or by choosing a predefined color. You can also drag and drop color swatches to rearrange the colors in your palette. ## Note For multi-series charts with numbered color swatches, the custom color palette shows swatches for 10 data series by default, and it can expand to show up to 20 data series. However, you can only modify as many swatches as you have data series. For example, if you have two data series in your chart, only the swatches numbered `1` and`2` have an effect on your chart. If additional series appear while the chart is rendering, Charts assigns them a new color. Other chart types use a gradient color scale with a set of pre-defined gradients. The[heatmap](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/heatmap/#std-label-heatmap-chart-ref) and [colored bar and column](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref) types use this method. ![Custom color palette selection](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/custom-gradient.png) To close the color customization tool, click somewhere outside it. To revert the entire chart to its default colors, set theCustom Color Palette toggle switch back to Off. ### Applicable Chart Types This customization option is available for all chart types except[Text.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/text-charts/#std-label-chart-type-text-charts) ## Resize Labels You can resize the text labels on a chart.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Axes On this page * [Max and Min](#max-and-min)\n* [Logarithmic Scale](#logarithmic-scale)\n* [Label Override](#label-override)\n* [Secondary Y Axis](#secondary-y-axis) MongoDB Charts offers several customization options which modify the representation of a chart's X and Y value axes without affecting the formatting of the data points in the visualization. ## Note This page illustrates the value axis customization options which are available for most [chart types](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-types/#std-label-chart-type-reference). Some chart types have other customization options which are noted on their individual documentation pages. To access value axis customization options, expand the Axessection of the Customize tab. ![Value axis customizations](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/value-axis-custom.png) ## Note A value axis shows a continuous scale of values. Charts such as[Bar/Column](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref) and[Discrete Line/Area](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-discrete-charts) have just one value axis. [Continuous line and area](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-continuous-charts)and [scatter](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/scatter-chart/#std-label-scatter-chart-ref) charts have two value axes. ## Max and Min The Max and Min value axis options allow you to specify maximum and minimum values to display on a chart. Any data points with values outside the specified limits appear at the boundaries of the chart. Setting a maximum display value is useful for removing outlying data from the chart and allowing the viewer to focus on more relevant information. ## Note Changing the minimum for bar and column charts from the default of zero is not recommended. Doing so means the length of the bars is no longer proportional to the data point values. The following chart types can use max and min: * all [Bar/Column](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref) except 100% stacked\n* [Discrete and Continuous Line](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-line-area-chart-ref)\n* [Discrete and Continuous Area](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-discrete-charts)\n* [Scatter](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/scatter-chart/#std-label-scatter-chart-ref) ## Logarithmic Scale Toggling the Logarithmic Scale switch to theOn position causes your chart to use a logarithmic scale instead of a linear scale for data values. Using a logarithmic scale is helpful for showing the percentage change from one value to the next and for charts with a large value differential from smallest to largest. Data sets such as stock market movements, earthquake strength measurements, and global population sizes are good use cases for a logarithmic scale chart. ### Logarithmic Scale Considerations * Use the Logarithmic Scale option only with chart data that consists of either all positive values or all negative values. If the chart includes a mix of positive and negative values, or if it includes the value `0`, the chart will not render.\n* Bar and column charts normally have a baseline of `0`, but logarithmic scale charts have a baseline of `1` because`log(0)` is undefined. As a result, charts with data points between`0` and `1` do not render well. You can mitigate this effect by setting the [axis minimum](#std-label-max-min-options) of the chart to a value greater than zero but smaller than the lowest value in the data set.

## Label Override The Label Override field allows you to create a custom axis label. Custom labels can be more descriptive than the default labels and help chart viewers quickly grasp the significance of chart data. The Label Override customization option is available on the `X`or `Y` value axis for charts in which the author has encoded multiple data series by mapping more than one field on a given axis. To customize the axis label for charts that have a single field mapped, use the Label Override option within that field's customization options. The following chart types can use label override: * [Bar/Column](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref)\n* [Line](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-line-area-chart-ref)\n* [Area](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-line-area-chart-ref)\n* [Scatter](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/scatter-chart/#std-label-scatter-chart-ref) ## Secondary Y Axis If you map multiple Aggregation or Value fields to the Y axis, you can plot one set of values on a secondary Y axis. This customization option is useful for comparing two data series with significantly different scales using the same chart. ![Secondary Y axis customization](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/secondary-y-customization.png) ### Usage You can plot a secondary Y axis on the following chart types: * [Grouped column](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref)\n* [Discrete line](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-line-area-chart-ref)\n* [Continuous line](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-continuous-charts)\n* [Continuous area](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-continuous-charts) To plot a field on a secondary Y axis: 1. Click the Customize tab above the [encoding channels](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels) in the [Chart Builder.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/)\n2. Expand the Fields section of the Customize tab.\n3. Select the field you want to plot on a secondary Y axis from the dropdown menu.\n4. Set the Plot on Secondary Axis toggle switch toOn. After the secondary Y axis is enabled, you can customize its [value axis options.](#std-label-value-axis-options) When the secondary Y axis is used for at least one series, two separate legends appear for the left Y axis and the right Y axis, each showing the series mapped to that legend. ### Example The following chart uses the `movies` collection in the `sample_mflix`database. The `metacritic` field rates movies on a scale of 0-100, while the `tomatoes.critic` field uses a scale of 0-10\\. This chart shows the total scores for all movies for ten directors, with the `metacritic`totals on the left Y axis and the `tomatoes.critic` totals on the right. The chart shows that Woody Allen gets better ratings from the Rotten Tomatoes reviewers, while Steven Soderbergh does better with the Metacritic reviewers. ![Secondary Y axis example

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Conditional Formatting On this page * [Applying Multiple Rules](#applying-multiple-rules)\n* [Use Case](#use-case)\n* [Add a Rule](#add-a-rule)\n* [Reorder, Edit, or Delete a Rule](#reorder--edit--or-delete-a-rule) MongoDB Charts provides conditional formatting options which modify the styling of individual chart values based on conditions you define. Conditional formatting is available for [Data Table](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/data-table/#std-label-data-table-ref)and [Number](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/number-chart/#std-label-number-chart-ref) charts. To view your existing rules or to add, edit, or delete a rule, expand the Conditional Formatting section of theCustomize tab. ![Image displaying the conditional formatting pane, under the Customize tab on a Table Text chart.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/conditional-formatting-custom.png) ## Applying Multiple Rules Multiple conditional formatting rules can affect the styling of the same value. Conditional formatting rules take precedence in the order you put them in. Rule `1` overwrites rule `2` in cases where both rules affect the same styling of a value. ## Example The following conditional formatting rules both apply to a value: 1. White text\n2. Black text, green background The value's text is white because rule `1` takes precedence. The background is green because both rules apply. ## Use Case Conditional formatting can help clarify the insights that your chart provides. The following example uses conditional formatting to highlight slight shifts in critical reception and runtime in movies of the 2000s. ![Example of a data table with conditional formatting applied.\nMovie statistics are displayed by year and colored with a gradient that highlights shifting trends.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/conditional-formatting-example-table.png) ## Add a Rule To add a conditional formatting rule: 1 ### Navigate to the Customize tab in the [Chart Builder](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/). 2 ### Expand the Conditional Formatting section. 3 ### Click Add. 4 ### Select Single Color or Color Scale. Single Color sets styling options for values in a field that match specific conditions. Color Scale applies a color gradient to the entire range of values in a field, with the minimum value colored by one end of the gradient and the maximum value colored by the opposite end of the gradient. 5 ### Configure conditions. To configure a condition for Single Color format rules: 1. From the Applies to dropdown menu, select a field or an aspect of your chart to which you want to apply a condition.\n2. From the Operator dropdown menu, select a condition. Depending on the type of field you selected, you can choose from numeric, string or date operators.\n3. From the Input dropdown menu, specify a value to which to compare field values using the operator you selected. ## Note For more information on condition configuration options, see[Conditions Reference.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/conditional-formatting-reference/#std-label-conditional-formatting-reference) You can add any number of conditions to a rule.

## Use Cases Scatter charts are useful for representing numerical data and showing clearly how data points cluster together in certain areas. The Size, Color, and Shapeencoding channels allow you to reveal additional trends for data dimensions with low cardinality. ## Tip A chart with many different colors or shapes may result in a cluttered visualization which is difficult to read. You can limit the number of categories in your chart by [binning](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data) or [limiting](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-limit-data) your data. Scatter charts show an individual marker for each data point, so they work better with smaller result sets. Outliers and extreme data points are easy to identify. Consider using a scatter chart to display: * Temperature data for selected cities\n* Volume of sales data for selected retail outlets\n* Population density figures across several countries ## Customization Options The following customization options are specific to scatter charts. To see all available customization options, see [Customize Charts.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) ### Opacity The Opacity customization option, measured as a percentage, modifies the transparency of the data point fill. This setting defaults to `0%`, which renders the data point fill as completely transparent. ### Stroke Thickness The Stroke Thickness customization option, measured in pixels, modifies the thickness of data point outlines. This setting defaults to `2`. ### Mark Size Adjust the size of the scatter marks. This option behaves differently based on whether you have a field mapped to the Sizeencoding channel. * If you do not have a field mapped to Size, theMark Size setting changes the size of the marks linearly based on the chosen value.\n* If you have a field mapped to Size, theMark Size setting changes the size of the largest mark, and also controls the difference between the smallest and largest marks. ### Smart Date Labels Smart labels for dates are axis markers grouped by units of time to reduce repetition of information. They are generated automatically based on the range of the chart when a `date` type field is encoded on an `X` or `Y` value axis.

The chart shows that lower-priced properties have a wider range of review scores, while higher-priced properties have a smaller score range with generally higher scores. ![Scatter chart example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/scatter-chart-airbnb.png) ### Movies with the Most Award Nominations The following more complex scatter chart uses a database with movie data compiled from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. The chart shows the TomatoMeter rating (ranging from 0 to 100) of movies with at least one award nomination. Each data point marker represents one movie. The X axis shows the movie's TomatoMeter rating and the Y axis shows the number of award nominations the movie received. The [query filter](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-charts-filter-documents) restricts the result set to exclude marginal data points. The chart uses the Color and Shape encoding channels to shed further light on the types of movies which receive the most award nominations. The color of each data point shows the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) rating the movie received. The chart uses the Shape encoding channel to indicate the year in which the movie was released, and [bins](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data) the data to place each movie into a time range, with each bin covering 25 years. Without the bins, there would be a different shape for every year, which would make the chart too noisy to read. ![Scatter chart

## Use Cases Column and bar charts display information in similar manners and, as such, have similar use cases. There are, however, situations where it may be beneficial to use one over the other: * A bar chart may be a better choice than a column chart when the category labels are long, as it may be difficult to quickly pinpoint which label applies to which column.\n* A column chart may be a better choice when comparing sequential values (such as time or geographic data) because the viewer will intuitively read these charts from left to right and attain the full picture of the visualization. ## Tip Column and bar charts are best suited for data with limited categories. When plotting data with many categories, such as years across a long period of time, consider using a[Line Chart.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/) You can also limit the number of categories displayed in your chart to focus on a subset of your data. MongoDB Charts provides the following methods to reduce the number of bars or columns plotted in the visualization: * [Filter documents](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-charts-filter-documents)\n* [Limit Data](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-limit-data)\n* [Bin data](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data) ## Customization Options The following customization options are specific to column and bar charts. To see all available customization options, see[Customize Charts.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) ### Adjust X-Axis Label Angle You can adjust the X-axis label angle. You can choose one of the following options: | Option    | Description                                 |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| Vertical  | Labels right-aligned at a 270 degree angle. |\n| Horizonal | Labels center-aligned at a 0 degree angle.  |\n| Diagonal  | Labels right-aligned at a 315 degree angle. | To set this option: 1. Open the [Customize](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) pane for your chart.\n2. In the Axes section, select a Label Anglefor the X Axis. ### Show or Hide Data Value Labels You can dictate whether Charts displays text labels for your data **values**.

### 100% Stacked Bar Chart The following 100% stacked bar chart visualizes the monthly cost of renting a home in three different suburbs of Austin, Texas, USA. Using a 100% stacked chart allows us to easily visualize the percentage of rental homes in each `monthly_price` [bin](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data) within each neighborhood. This provides a clear picture of how these neighborhoods generally compare on rental prices. This is the complete [filter](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-charts-filter-documents) used for this chart: `| {                                                       |\n| ------------------------------------------------------- |\n| $and: [                                                 |\n| { monthly_price:                                        |\n| { $exists: true, $lte: 2000 }                           |\n| },                                                      |\n| { 'address.suburb':                                     |\n| { $in: [\"Georgian Acres\", \"South Congress\", \"Wooten\"] } |\n| }                                                       |\n| ]                                                       |\n| }                                                       | ` The Y Axis category channel creates a bar for each of the three suburbs in the filter. The X Axis channel aggregates to obtain a count of documents matching each respective suburb. TheSeries encoding channel of `monthly_price` splits each bar into categories colored according to the legend on the right side of the chart: ![Colored Bar Chart Reference](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/100-bar-chart.png) ### Colored Bar Chart The following colored bar chart shows the average [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) rating for countries with the 10 highest ratings, and colors each bar to show the average runtime for movies from each country. The Y Axis category creates a bar for each country in the data set, which we limit to only the top 10 as sorted by the aggregated mean of the `tomato.rating` field from the X Axis. TheColor encoding channel field of `runtime` colors each bar to show the average runtime for movies from each country. A darker shade of green indicates a longer average runtime: ![Colored Bar Chart Reference](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/colored-bar-chart-reference.png) ## Limitations The maximum query response size for column and bar charts is 5000 documents. ← [Chart Types](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-types/ \"Previous Section\")[Line and Area

Configure the [Date and Time Formatting](#std-label-date-time-format) and[Convert Time Zone](#std-label-convert-time-zone) settings as desired. ### Date and Time Formatting Use this option to specify how Charts formats dates and times. Click the dropdowns in this customization section to select a preset format provided by Charts. Chartsprovides one dropdown for selecting a date format and one dropdown for selecting a time format. ## Note Depending on the [binning](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data) type selected for the field, Charts may not show both date formatting dropdowns. Also, the options in the dropdowns change depending on the binning type selected. For more information, see the[Considerations](#std-label-time-zone-considerations) section. You can also use the input box below the dropdowns to specify a custom datetime format.

## Example Consider a timestamp of November 8th, 2018 1:30:58 PM. The following table shows how various custom date filters would output the date: | Custom Format      | Output             |\n| ------------------ | ------------------ |\n| YYYY/MM/DD         | 2018/11/18         |\n| MMM YY             | Nov 18             |\n| DDD, YYYY HH:mm:ss | 322, 2018 13:30:58 |\n| DD-MMM H:mm:ss A   | 08-Nov 1:30:58 PM  | Once you modify a preset's attribute, Chartschanges the preset selection in the dropdown to Custom. #### Considerations If you [bin](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data) your timeseries data, you cannot specify a unit of time in your custom format with smaller granularity than your bin size. For example, if you bin data by Month, you cannot specify days, hours, minutes, or seconds in your custom format because Charts does not show these values in the visualization. If you enter an invalid custom datetime format, Charts highlights the format input box in red. Specifying the Periodic option further limits valid formatting options. For example, if you bin data by Month, you can only specify `year` in your date format if you disable thePeriodic option. If you enable the Periodicoption, you cannot specify `year` because Charts only displays the `month` in the field. ### Convert Time Zone By default, MongoDB Charts displays timeseries data exactly how it appears in the original dataset, which is assumed to be inUTC. You can use this customization option to convert the time zone in which Chartsdisplays the data to best fit the location of the data or the viewers of the chart. To enable this option: 1. Set the Convert Time Zone toggle switch toOn.\n2. Use the dropdown below the toggle to select the desired time zone for your data. ## Note When you convert time zones, Charts automatically accounts for Daylight Savings Time when required. You can search the dropdown to easily filter for the desired time zone.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Number Chart On this page * [Number Chart Encoding Channels](#number-chart-encoding-channels)\n* [Use Cases](#use-cases)\n* [Customization Options](#customization-options)\n* [Examples](#examples)\n* [Limitations](#limitations) Number charts display a single aggregated value from a data field. ## Number Chart Encoding Channels Number charts only require a single encoding channel, calledNumber. This is an aggregation encoding channel which aggregates based on the field and aggregation method chosen, and displays the result in the chart. ## Use Cases Number charts are useful for highlighting grand totals or values which represent the overall state of your data. For example, a store may use a number chart to represent the total dollar value of all sales. Additionally, a hotel chain may use a number chart to represent the average number of vacant rooms across all hotels, or apply a[filter](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-charts-filter-documents) to see the total number of vacant rooms in a select region. ## Customization Options ### Conditional Formatting You can style the number that your chart displays with conditional formatting rules. These rules are applied dynamically: if your number changes to match or stop matching a condition you define, its styling updates. To learn how to use conditional formatting rules, see the[Conditional Formatting](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/conditional-formatting/#std-label-conditional-formatting)customization option. ## Examples ### Total Value of Store Sales The following chart visualizes sales data from a mock office supply store. Each document in the collection represents an individual sale, which contains information on the item(s) sold and the purchaser. This number chart shows the total sum of all sales stored in the collection: ![Sales number chart example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/number-chart-example.png) The Number field of `items.price` tells MongoDB Charts to aggregate the field based on the selected method of[$sum](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sum/). Since`items` is an array, we have to select an array reduction option before we can aggregate. In this example, we chooseUnwind Array, which creates a new document for each element in the `items` array. MongoDB Charts sums the `price` of each newly created document and displays the value in the visualization. ### Maximum Calories Burned During Workouts The following chart visualizes workout data. Each document in the collection represents an individual workout activity, which contains information on the type of activity performed and the amount of calories burned during the workout. This number chart shows the maximum calories burned across all `swimming` and `surfing`workouts: ![Workout number chart example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/number-chart-example-2.png) The Number field of `Calories Burned (kCal)` tellsMongoDB Charts to aggregate the field based on the selected method of[$max.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/max/) We have applied a [filter](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-charts-filter-documents) to this chart to restrict the documents MongoDB Charts examines to only those with an`Activity Type` of `Surf`, `Swim`, or `Indoor Swim`. MongoDB Chartsdetermines the maximum value of the `Calories Burned (kCal)` field across all documents which match this criteria and displays the value in the visualization. ## Limitations The maximum query response size for a number chart is 5000 documents. ← [Limit the Rows a Data Table Displays](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/data-table/limit-rows/ \"Previous

[Heatmap](#heatmap) Geospatial data defines specific geographical locations, either in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates or text fields with names of geographical areas, such as countries or states. Geospatial charts combine geospatial data with other forms of data to create map-based charts. MongoDB collections can store geospatial data as[GeoJSON objects](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/geospatial-queries/#geospatial-geojson)or as [legacy coordinate pairs.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/geospatial-queries/#geospatial-legacy) Geospatial charts can visualize geospatial data in a variety of chart formats, including [choropleth](#std-label-choropleth-description), [scatter](#std-label-scatter-description), and [heatmap.](#std-label-heatmap-description) ## Tip ### See also:  [Geopoint encoding channel type](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-geopoint-channel) ## Choropleth [Choropleth charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/choropleth/#std-label-choropleth-ref) use predefined [shapes](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/choropleth-regions/#std-label-choropleth-shape-scheme) for geographical areas, e.g. the countries of the world, or the states of the United States. They are useful for comparing aggregated values across defined geographical areas. ![Choropleth chart example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/geo-type-choropleth.png) ## Scatter [Scatter charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/geospatial-scatter/#std-label-scatter-ref) use customizable data markers to indicate data points on a map. ![Scatter chart

Cases](#use-cases)\n* [Customization Options](#customization-options)\n* [Examples](#examples)\n* [Limitations](#limitations) Line charts and area charts display information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. In area charts, the space beneath the line segments is filled in with color, whereas in line charts only the line segments are rendered with no additional coloring or shading. These charts facilitate visualizing data over a period of time (using time series data) and identifying trends and patterns across the entire data range. Line and area charts support visualizing both [discrete](#std-label-discrete-charts) and [continuous](#std-label-continuous-charts) data. ## Discrete Line and Area Charts Discrete line and area charts visualize categorical or [binned](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data) data with some form of logical ordering, such as time. MongoDB Charts always [aggregates](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-building-charts-aggregation)values in discrete charts such that any number of documents can supply values to a given plotted point.

### 100% Stacked Area Charts 100% stacked area charts are a subtype of discrete area charts. In 100% stacked area charts, the total area shown is normalized to 100% and split into segments based on the category in the Series [encoding channel](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels). Each series is shown as a percentage of the whole. When using a traditional stacked area chart, it can be difficult to compare the proportions of each series to the whole if the total value of the chart segments greatly differ. 100% stacked charts make it easier to compare proportions of each series to the whole by showing relative percentages. For a detailed example, see the [100% Stacked Area Chart Example.](#std-label-one-hundred-stacked-area-example) ## Continuous Line and Area Charts In continuous line and area charts, every data point comes from a distinct document in the [data source](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/data-sources/). Continuous charts do not support aggregation or binning. A continuous chart would be useful to visualize stock closing prices over time, assuming each closing price comes from a distinct document in the dataset. ### Continuous Chart Encoding Channels

### Smart Date Labels for Continuous Line and Area Charts Smart labels for dates are axis markers grouped by units of time to reduce repetition of information. They are generated automatically based on the range of the chart when a `date` type field is encoded on an `X` or `Y` value axis. Smart labels are enabled by default when dates fields are encoded on value axes on supported chart types. To toggle smart labels on and off: 1. Click the Customize tab above the [encoding channels](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels) in the [Chart Builder.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/)\n2. Expand the Fields section.\n3. Select the desired field from the dropdown menu.\n4. If the Use Smart Labels on Axis toggle swich is set to Off, toggle it to On. ![Smart label toggle switch](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/smart-label-switch.png) ## Note When smart labels are enabled, date and time formatting options remain available. Any formatting options you apply are visible in the chart's tooltips. ## Discrete Area Versus Continuous Area Charts Display Discrete area charts are _stacked_, meaning MongoDB Charts plots each series above or below the others in the visualization. The chart shows the total aggregated value of all of the series, so you can easily see the proportion of each series in relation to the total. Continuous area charts are _overlaid_, meaning MongoDB Charts plots each series directly on top of one another in the visualization. ## Use Cases Line charts and area charts are closely related and are both useful for depicting time series data and data with logical ordering. However, there are scenarios when it may be beneficial to use one chart type over the other. * Consider using a line chart when creating [multi-series charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/multi-series-charts/#std-label-multi-series-charts) where each series represents an isolated field. MongoDB Charts stacks multi-series area charts, as shown in this [example](#std-label-area-chart-multi-series-example), which results in a chart where the stacked totals appear to share a relationship contributing to a larger summed value. This may not be desireable depending on the specific relationships within the data fields.  \n   * The line chart displays the data from each series in-line with one another without stacking, which may provide a more accurate representation of the data as shown in the[discrete line chart.](#std-label-discrete-line-chart-example)\n* Area charts are useful for showing an overall trend while also highlighting relative performances of individual components of that sum.  \n   * Consider using a discrete area chart when illustrating a part-to-whole relationship, such as tracking data metrics over time. An example of this might be showing `revenue` compared with`expenses` over the course of a year.  \n   * A continuous area chart would work in this scenario if you were less concerned with the summation of the two fields and instead wanted a more direct comparison of the fields against one another. ## Tip When your data does not have a logical order, consider instead using a [bar or column chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref) to visualize your data. When the order of the data is not important, a bar or column chart can quickly highlight the highest and lowest values in the visualization, which may be more beneficial than suggesting the viewer read the chart from left to right as in a line or area chart. ## Customization Options The following customization options are specific to line and area charts. To see all available customization options, see[Customize Charts.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) ### Adjust X-Axis Label Angle You can adjust the X-axis label angles in[Discrete Area Chart with Multiple Series](#std-label-area-chart-multi-series-example) and[Discrete Line Chart with Multiple Aggregated Fields](#std-label-discrete-line-chart-example) charts.

## Examples ### Discrete Area Chart with Multiple Series The following chart visualizes sales data from a mock office supply store. Each document in the collection represents an individual sale with information on the item(s) sold and the customer conducting the purchase. This discrete area chart shows the distribution of customer ages throughout sales in the collection: ![Discrete area example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/discrete-area-example.png) The X Axis field of `customer.age` plots the ages of the customers along the X axis. We direct to Charts to [bin](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data) the ages into groups of 5. The Y Axis field of `customer.age` andaggregate option of count counts the occurrences of each age in the corresponding bin. Lastly, we apply the `item.name` field to theSeries encoding channel to split the age area into segments displaying the count of each age group purchasing each store item. ## Note For more information on multi-series charts, see[Multi-Series Charts.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/multi-series-charts/#std-label-multi-series-charts) ### 100% Stacked Area Chart The following chart visualizes data from a mock office supply store. Each document in the collection represents an individual sale with information on the item(s) sold and the customer conducting the purchase. This 100% stacked area chart shows the relative percentages of items sold on each date of the month: ![Discrete area example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/100-area-example.png) The X Axis field of `saleDate` plots each sale according to its date. The [Binning](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data) and[Periodic](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-periodic-setting) settings are enabled, soCharts groups the dates into bins based on each date of the month. ## Note For more information on binning dates and the periodic setting, refer to the [Bin Data](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data) page. The Y Axis field of `_id` runs a [count](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/count/) aggregation to calculate the total number of sales that happened each day of the month. Since this is a 100% stacked chart, these values are all normalized to 100%, and are segmented by the Series [encoding channel](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels). The Series field of `item.name` segments the total chart area based on the name of the item sold. Since there may be multiple items in a single document, we Unwind this array to add each item to the visualization. This provides a clear picture of the relative percentages of items sold based on the date of the month. ### Discrete Line Chart with Multiple Aggregated Fields The following chart visualizes data pertaining to movies. Each document in the collection represents a movie and contains general information about the film and ratings from various rating aggregators. This discrete line chart compares average[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) `tomato.meter` ratings and average [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/) ratings of films over time. Both ratings are on a scale from `0` \\- `100`: ![Discrete line example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/discrete-line-example.png) The X Axis field of `year` plots each film according to its release year. We direct to Charts to [bin](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data) the years into groups of 5. The Y Axis fields of `tomato.meter` and `metacritic`along with the aggregate option of meancalculate and plot the average ratings of films from each group of 5 years. ## Note For more information on creating charts with multiple aggregated fields, see [Multiple Field Mappings.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/multi-series-charts/#std-label-multiple-field-mappings) ### Continuous Line Chart Using Time Series Data The following chart visualizes data pertaining to the usage of a solar-powered house battery.

The X Axis field of `timestamp` plots each timestamp in the data source. The Y Axis fields of `energy_left` and`total_pack_energy` each plot a series in the chart; the amount of energy the battery has left and the total amount of energy the battery holds. This comparison shows how close the battery is to a full charge. ## Note A continuous chart works better than a discrete chart in this case because our X Axis field, `timestamp` is not a discrete, categorical variable, and is instead a continuous value along a range. We want to plot each `timestamp` as an individual point, rather than show an aggregated value from many data values. ## Limitations * The maximum document limit for discrete line and area charts is

## Use Cases Data tables have a wide variety of applications, but are most useful when comparing multiple categories of calculated values. Visual charts struggle to display multiple categories of data without losing their audience. Data tables present data with multiple categories such that you can see which value applies to which slice of data. Data tables are also useful for showing precise data values, rather than comparing approximate values. Comparing approximate values is best done with a visual representation, instead of text. You can use data tables to show: * The total cost to rent an apartment, including rent, cleaning fees, and security deposits organized by location and total area of the unit.\n* Time spent working out and total calories burned during various exercises categorized by the type of exercise and time of day the exercised was performed. ## Customization Options The following customization options are specific to data table charts. To see all available customization options, see[Customize Charts.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) ### Wrap Text You can wrap text that does fit in a single data cell across multiple lines. This setting is off by default. To turn it on: 1. Select the Customize tab of the Chart Builder.\n2. Expand the Fields section.\n3. Select your desired field from the dropdown menu.\n4. Toggle the Wrap Text switch to enable this feature. ### Pin Columns You can pin Group and Row Total columns to the side of the data table. A pinned column remains fixed in place while the rest of the table scrolls. To pin a column, hover over the column you want to pin and click the button in the column header. The button toggles on and the column pins to the side of the data table: * A Group column pins to the left of any unpinned columns.\n* The Row Total column pins to the right of any unpinned columns. To unpin a column, click the  button in the header of the column you want to unpin. The  button toggles off and if the column is a Group column, it moves to the right of any pinned Group columns. ### Conditional Formatting You can create styling rules for table cell values that match conditions you define. Conditional formatting rules affect the look of your chart dynamically: if the value of a table cell changes to match or stop matching your conditions, its styling updates to reflect that. To learn how to use conditional formatting rules, see the[Conditional Formatting](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/conditional-formatting/#std-label-conditional-formatting)customization option. ## Examples The following data table examples visualize data from a hospitality and property service. Each document in the collection represents a unit available for rent and includes information such as the monthly unit price, neighborhood, and property type. ### Basic Data Table The following data table categorizes the rental listings by property type and location, and shows the average review rating and average weekly rent for each group: ![Basic Data Table Example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/data-table-basic-example.png) The Group encoding channels of `property_type` and`suburb` create a row in the data table for each unique combination of those two fields in the data. The Values of `review_scores_rating` and`weekly_price` each add a column to the table. For both values, we average the rating and price for each `property type` and `suburb`using [aggregation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/) and display the results in the data table. The results are formatted using the Customization tab to display the mean weekly price as currency and round the mean review score to an appropriate number of decimal places. ## Note We have applied a [filter](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-charts-filter-documents) to this chart to only display listings which have a `weekly_price`associated with them. ### Data Table with Dynamic Columns The following data table displays nearly the same data as the previous basic data table example. In this example, instead of making`property_type` and `suburb` Groups, `property_type`field is now a Dynamic Column: ![Basic Data Table Example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/data-table-dynamic-example.png) Now, rather than having two category columns in the table, the`property_types` become column titles. We are still aggregating the mean of the `weekly_price` based on each combination of`property_type` and `suburb`.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Choropleth Chart Shape Schemes MongoDB Charts provides shape schemes to help define regions in your[Choropleth Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/choropleth/#std-label-choropleth-ref). Each shape scheme has a distinct set of expected values where each value corresponds to a region. ## Shape Schemes and Location In choropleth charts, you specify regions with the[Location](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/choropleth/#mongodb-data-Location) channel.

charts bring together the useful aspects of both [column](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref) and [line](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/line-area-chart/#std-label-line-area-chart-ref) charts into a single chart. ## Customization Options The following customization options are specific to combo charts. To see all available customization options, see[Customize Charts.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) ## Note If the columns and lines in your combo use different scales, consider a [Secondary Y Axis](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/value-axis-options/#std-label-secondary-y-axis). This option appears on theCustomize pane in the Fields section for any fields mapped to the Lines channel. Fields mapped to theColumns channel appear only on the primary axis. ### Adjust X-Axis Label Angle You can adjust the X-axis label angle. You can choose one of the following options: | Option    | Description                                 |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| Vertical  | Labels right-aligned at a 270 degree angle. |\n| Horizonal | Labels center-aligned at a 0 degree angle.  |\n| Diagonal  | Labels right-aligned at a 315 degree angle. | To set this option: 1. Open the [Customize](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) pane for your chart.\n2. In the Axes section, select a Label Anglefor the X Axis. ### Set Distinct Dash Style per Series On combo charts, you can opt to display each series in the chart with a distinct dash style. This option can help make your chart more accessible by distinguishing between series beyond color. To set this option: 1.

Enabling this option makes it easier to see exactly where your data points lie along a line. Hovering over these markers shows the exact data values in a tooltip, making it easier to view precise measurements. To set this option: 1. Open the [Customize](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) pane for your chart.\n2. In the General Customization section, set theData Markers toggle switch to the desired setting. To customize the formatting of the number in the data marker tooltip, modify the [Number Formatting](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/field-level-options/#std-label-customize-number-formats)settings for the relevant field. ### Show or Hide Data Value Labels You can dictate whether Charts displays text labels for your data **values**. Data value labels show the exact values of your data points.

MongoDB Charts creates a segment in the donut for each unique value from this field.NoteThe Label encoding channel supports[binning](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data) for numeric and date fields. The channel supports [sorting](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-sort-data) and[limiting](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-limit-data) for string fields. |\n| Arc              | The aggregation encoding channel. MongoDB Charts [aggregates](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-building-charts-aggregation) this field based on the aggregation method selected. This field dictates the size of each circle segment.If you don't add a field to the Label channel, you can add multiple fields to the Arc channel. MongoDB Chartscreates one segment for each encoded field.                    | ## Use Cases Donut charts are ideal for giving readers a quick overview of the proportional distribution of a dataset. Use donut charts when the general trend of data is more important than precise data values. Donut charts are especially useful when there is a low number of categories to visualize, because it is easier to compare fewer segments of the circle to see which values make up the greatest parts of the whole.

## Note Although you can [limit](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-limit-data) your data to reduce the number of categories in the visualization, this may not be the best choice for donut charts. The purpose of donut charts is to show each value as a proportion of a total, so excluding categories may result in a misleading visualization that reflects inaccurate proportions. If you do [limit](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-limit-data) your data, donut charts enable the Show \"All Others\" option by default. This option creates an \"All others\" category that represents the sum of the omitted values and ensures that chart values are displayed as a proportion of the total. When looking to compare individual data values, rather than show values as a proportion to a whole, consider using a[column or bar chart.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-column-bar-chart-ref) ## Customization Options The following customization options are specific to donut charts. To see all available customization options, see[Customize Charts.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) ### Show or Hide Category Labels You can dictate whether Charts displays text labels for**categories** in your donut charts. To set this option: 1. Open the [Customize](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) pane for your chart.\n2. In the General Customization section, set theData Category Labels toggle switch to the desired setting. ## Note When you enable one or both of theData Value Labels or Data Category Labelssettings on a [Donut Chart](#std-label-donut-chart-ref) with many categories, MongoDB Charts only renders labels for the highest value categories. ### Show or Hide Data Value Labels You can dictate whether Charts displays text labels for your data **values**. Data value labels show the exact values of your data points. To set this option: 1. Open the [Customize](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) pane for your chart.\n2. In the General Customization section, set theData Value Labels toggle switch to the desired setting. To customize the formatting of the number in the data label, modify the [Number Formatting](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/field-level-options/#std-label-customize-number-formats) settings for the relevant field. ## Note When used with [stacked](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/column-bar-chart/#std-label-stacked-ref-example) column and bar charts, data labels show the sum of all series in each column or bar. ### Show Value or Percentage Labels You can dictate whether a [Donut Chart](#std-label-donut-chart-ref) displays data values as raw values or percentages. By default, data value labels show the raw values of your data points. For percentage values in[Donut Charts](#std-label-donut-chart-ref), the whole value is the total value of the entire chart. Percentage labels are always rounded to one decimal place, and do not adhere to [Number Formatting](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/field-level-options/#std-label-customize-number-formats) settings. To set this option: 1. Open the [Customize](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) pane for your chart.\n2. In the General Customization section, set theData Value Labels toggle switch to on if off.\n3. Select Show Value or Show Percentage from the drop-down. ## Examples ### Donut Chart Using Count The following chart visualizes sales data from a mock office supply store.

We see based on the visualization that the most common purchase method is `In store`, followed by `Online`. ## Note In this example we are counting entire documents, so it does not matter what field we select for the Arc field. No matter what field we apply, the visualization will still be the same. ### Donut Chart Using Sum The following chart visualizes personal workout data. Each document in the collection represents a single workout activity, which includes information on the type of activity performed and the amount of time spent exercising. This donut chart shows the proportional time spent performing each exercise activity: ![Donut Chart Using Sum Example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/donut-chart-workout-example.png) The Label field of `Activity Type` tells MongoDB Charts to create a circle segment for each unique value in the `Activity Type`field. MongoDB Charts proportions each segment according to the aggregated value signified in the Arc encoding channel. In this case, we aggregate to find the total sum of workout times for documents with the same `Activity Type` value. We see based on the visualization that the activity with the greatest total workout time is `Surf`, followed by `Bike Ride`. ### Donut Chart Using Multiple Arc Fields The following chart vizualizes rental property data. Each document in the collection represents a single rental property, which includes information on prices. This donut chart shows the average price of all properties in the collection for a daily, weekly, and monthly rental: ![Donut Chart Multiple Arc Fields Example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/donut-chart-airbnb-example.png) Because there is no Label field, MongoDB Charts creates a circle segment for each Arc field. MongoDB Charts proportions each segment according to the aggregated value signified in theArc encoding channel.

## Target and Maximum Interaction The value encoded in the Target channel and theMaximum customization affect each others' behavior. The followling table explains the effect on the chart of having one, both, or neither of the values set. | Target  | Maximum | Behavior                                                                                    |\n| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| None    | Default | No target line. Gauge maximum is the next power of 10 above the value of the Value channel. |\n| None    | Custom  | No target line. Gauge maximum is the specified value.                                       |\n| Encoded | Default | Target line is rendered. Gauge maximum matches the target value.                            |\n| Encoded | Custom  | Target line is rendered. Gauge maximum is the specified value.                              | ## Use Cases Gauge charts are useful for displaying a data value represented as a fraction of a larger value. Gauge charts are a familiar way to represent a situation in which a container may be either full or empty or somewhere in between.

## Examples The following chart shows progress towards a goal. A clothing retailer has a goal of selling 100 green shirts per month. ![Gauge chart example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/gauge-chart-example.png) This chart uses a filter to find sales order documents in which the `item`field is `shirt` and the `color` field is `green`. The `qty` field is encoded in the Value channel to a get an aggregated total. The 100-shirt goal is a constant value, so the chart uses a [calculated field](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/calculated-fields/#std-label-calculated-fields) named `target` with a value of `100`

are maps that use shading to depict differences across regions. The shading of a region (e.g. states, countries) is based on an aggregated value and is proportional to the corresponding value of other regions. Unlike other geospatial charts, choropleths do not require coordinate data in your collections. Instead you can have names of regions as strings, so long as the region strings correspond to the names used in a supported [Shape Scheme.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/choropleth-regions/#std-label-choropleth-shape-scheme) ## Regions To help define regions, MongoDB Charts provides[Shape Schemes](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/choropleth-regions/#std-label-choropleth-shape-scheme).

## Use Cases Choropleth charts can be used to depict differences in your selected aggregated field between geographic subregions, such as states or countries. They are useful when you have a dataset with clearly defined subregions compatible with one of the[Shape Schemes](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/choropleth-regions/#std-label-choropleth-shape-scheme) MongoDB Charts provides. A choropleth chart is a good choice to compare: * Population density across US states.\n* Annual rainfall across European countries.\n* Number of cellphone towers across Australian states. ## Tip ### See also:  If you are looking for a chart to depict exact values rather than a high-level comparison, consider using a[Data Table.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/data-table/#std-label-data-table-ref) ## Customization Options The following customization options are specific to choropleth charts. For general customization options, see [Customize Charts.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) ### Automatically Set Viewport By default, geospatial charts show a map which includes all the data point markers in your specified collection. You can pan and zoom to change the map view, but if you close the chart and re-open it the map reverts to its default state. This behavior is controlled by theAutomatically Set Viewport option. When you toggle the Automatically Set Viewport switch to`Off`, the area and zoom level at which the map is saved becomes the new default view. ## Note You can pan and zoom the map area in a chart on a dashboard, but these changes do not affect the default map view. ### Opacity The Opacity level of a map modifies the degree to which the chart's map data shows through the data point markers. Choropleth charts default to `100%`. ### Custom Color Palette The color palette specifies the range of colors that corresponds to relative aggregated values in your map. Choropleth charts use a gradient color picker. To enable palette customization, toggle theCustom Color Palette switch in the Generalsection. For more information, see [Color Palette Customization.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/general-customization/#std-label-color-palette-customization) ## Examples The following choropleth chart visualizes the total count of movie releases across various countries. Each document in the collection contains an array of countries where a particular movie was released. ![Choropleth example chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/geo-type-choropleth.png) In this chart, we specify a[Shape Scheme](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/choropleth-regions/#std-label-choropleth-shape-scheme) ofWorld Countries to divide the map into countries. The `countries` array in the Location field contains an array of elements representing each country where a movie was released. These elements match the values expected by theWorld Countries shape scheme. We unwind the array so each movie contributes to the count for each country where it was released. The Color field of `id` is aggregated byCount. As a result, each country is shaded based on its number of movies released. The custom color palatte for this chart ranges from yellow for lower ratings to dark red for higher ratings. Based on the visualization, we see that France, India, and Japan have relatively high movie release counts compared with other countries. ## Tip ### See also:  For a complete list of choropleth Shape Schemes and their expected values, refer to the[Choropleth Regions](#std-label-choropleth-regions) page. ## Limitations The maximum query response size for a choropleth chart is 5000 documents. ←

[Donut Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/donut-chart/#std-label-donut-chart-ref) display data in a series of segments of a circle, with larger segments representing larger data values. The entire circle represents the sum of all data values, and each segment indicates the proportion of each category in the data to the total. ![Example of a donut chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/donut-simple-example.png) [Gauge Chart](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/gauge-chart/) [Gauge Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/gauge-chart/#std-label-gauge-chart-ref) display data as a percentage of a semicircle, with customizable minimum and maximum values.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Top Item Chart On this page * [Top Item Chart Encoding Channels](#top-item-chart-encoding-channels)\n* [Use Cases](#use-cases)\n* [Examples](#examples) Top Item charts show information from the document with the greatest or smallest value for a specified field. When you create a Top Item chart, you specify: * The field by which to sort your collection.\n* Whether you want to sort in ascending or descending order.\n* The fields you want to display from the first document returned by your specified sort. ## Top Item Chart Encoding Channels Top Item charts utilize the following [encoding channels:](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels) | Encoding Channel | Description                                                                                 |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Sort             | The field by which to sort the collection. You can specify an ascending or descending sort. |\n| Display          | The fields to display from the top item in the collection after sorting.                    | ## Note You cannot perform aggregations on Displayfields. ## Use Cases Use Top Item charts to show information about the most extreme or most recent instance of a particular field value. For example, you can use Top Item charts to show information on: * The most recent reading from a collection of sensor data, such as temperature readings.\n* The highest rated movie in a collection.\n* The cheapest available room in a collection of available hotel listings.\n* The largest sale recorded in the past month (when combining a Top Item chart with [date filters](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/filter-chart-results/#std-label-charts-filter-documents)). ## Examples The following chart uses a data source containing [Sample AirBnB Listing](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-airbnb/) data and shows information on the document with the highest `monthly_price` in the collection: ![Top Item Chart with AirBnB Data](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/top-item-example.png) The chart sorts the documents based on `monthly_price` in descending order, and returns the first document appearing in the sort. The chart displays the following fields: * `monthly_price`\n* `property_type`\n* `country`\n* `suburb` ← [Word Cloud](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/word-cloud/ \"Previous

Channels](#geospatial-heatmap-encoding-channels)\n* [Customization Options](#customization-options)\n* [Examples](#examples)\n* [Tutorials](#tutorials)\n* [Limitations](#limitations) You can use geospatial heatmap charts to visualize how geographic areas of a map compare to one another based on a given criterion. ## Geospatial Heatmap Encoding Channels ### Coordinates A geopoint encoding channel which defines the map area of the chart. See the [Geopoint](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-geopoint-channel) reference page for more information about what types of data you can use in this channel. ### Intensity An aggregation encoding channel that changes the shading of the colors in different chart regions to reflect the aggregated values of this field. More intense colors in the visualization reflect greater aggregated values. The [radius customization option](#std-label-customize-radius) dictates the size of the data markers in [Geospatial Heatmaps](#std-label-geospatial-heatmap-type). The color of each data marker reflects the aggregated value of all data points within that marker's radius. ## Example If ten data points exist within the specified radius, the color displayed is based on the aggregated value of those ten data points. ## Note Intensity shading is local to the map's current view. The most intense color is displayed for the most extreme aggregated values currently visible on the map, even if there are points outside the current view that are more extreme. ### Legend Unlike other types of charts, the legend and the chart colors on geospatial heatmaps change when the view changes. The color range is based on the data in the current view, and may change when you pan or zoom the map. ## Customization Options The following customization options are specific to geospatial heatmap charts. For general customization options, see [Customize Charts.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) ### Automatically Set Viewport By default, geospatial charts show a map which includes all the data point markers in your specified collection. You can pan and zoom to change the map view, but if you close the chart and re-open it the map reverts to its default state. This behavior is controlled by theAutomatically Set Viewport option. When you toggle the Automatically Set Viewport switch to`Off`, the area and zoom level at which the map is saved becomes the new default view. ## Note You can pan and zoom the map area in a chart on a dashboard, but these changes do not affect the default map view. ### Radius You can adjust the radius of your data points. The radius is measured in pixels and defaults to `30`. ### Opacity The Opacity level of a map modifies the degree to which the chart's map data shows through the data point markers. Geospatial heatmap charts default to `100%`. ### Custom Color Palette The color palette specifies the range of colors that corresponds to relative aggregated values in your map. Geospatial heatmap charts use a gradient color picker. To enable palette customization, toggle theCustom Color Palette switch in the Generalsection. For more information, see [Color Palette Customization.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/general-customization/#std-label-color-palette-customization) ## Examples The following chart is based on AirBnB data for the New York City area. It shows rental rate hot spots in a geospatial heatmap. ![Geospatial heatmap example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/geo-type-heatmap.png) The Coordinates channel uses the `location` database field, which contains arrays of latitude-longitude pairs. TheIntensity field uses the `monthly_price` database field, which contains monthly rental rates for each property in the database. ## Tutorials See the following tutorials to build geospatial heatmap

### Create a Geospatial Heatmap Chart Using GeoJSON Points This tutorial demonstrates how to create a geospatial heatmap chart with fields that are [GeoJSON Points](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/geojson/). The final chart displays a heatmap of average AirBnB prices in New York. ## Note Charts automatically determines if field types in your collection are [GeoJSON Points](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/geojson/) by displaying the  icon. You can map these fields directly to a geopoint channel type in the Chart Builder. For more information, see [Geopoint Channel Type.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-geopoint-channel) 1 #### Add a geospatial heatmap chart to your dashboard. 1. From the Dashboards page, select the dashboard where you want to add a new chart. For instructions on setting up a dashboard, see [Dashboards.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/)\n2. Click Add Chart.\n3. In the Select Data Source modal, click theProject tab.\n4. In the cluster where you loaded the sample data, select the `listingsAndReviews` collection in the `sample_airbnb` database.\n5. In the Chart Type dropdown, click Geo Heatmap. For more details, see [Create a Chart.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/#std-label-create-new-chart) 2 #### Add fields to your chart. 1. Select the Encode tab.\n2. Navigate to the Fields pane on the left side of the Chart Builder. This section lists all available fields in the`listingsAndReviews` collection.\n3. Drag the `location` geopoint field nested in the `address`field to the Coordinates encoding channel.\n4. Drag the `price` field to the Intensity encoding channel. Then, in the Aggregate dropdown that appears, set the aggregation method to mean.  \nCharts displays the aggregated mean prices of AirBnB listings across the world. The color gradient to the right represents the range of prices in the heatmap. A more intense gradation reflects higher prices in the area.  \n## Note  \nTo customize colors, click the Customize tab. Under General, enable theCustom Color Palette and set your preferred colors. For more information, see[Color Palette Customization.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/general-customization/#std-label-color-palette-customization) 3 #### Filter your results. 1.

A darker, or more intense, color represents a larger aggregated value for a particular data point. ## Heatmap Encoding Channels Heatmaps provide the following [encoding channels:](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels) | Encoding Channel | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| X Axis           | A category encoding channel that creates a category along the X axis for each unique value in this field.                                                                                                                     |\n| Y Axis           | A category encoding channel that creates a category along the Y axis for each unique value in this field.                                                                                                                     |\n| Intensity        | An aggregation encoding channel that changes the shading of the colors in different chart regions to reflect the aggregated values of this field. More intense colors in the visualization reflect greater aggregated values. | ## Note Heatmaps support [sorting](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-sort-data) and[limiting](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-limit-data) for theX Axis encoding channel, but not theY Axis channel. ## Use Cases Heatmaps reveal patterns or trends within your data. Use heatmaps when the exact data values are not as important as depicting higher-level trends and relationships between your data points. They can also highlight any significant outliers, or points which strongly go against the general direction of your data. A heatmap is a good choice to display: * A comparison of average room rental prices based on location and property type.\n* Geographic data, such as election results across different districts or population density.\n* The number of customer orders across various store locations by month of the year. ## Tip Heatmaps work especially well with [binned](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data)data.

### Adjust X-Axis Label Angle You can adjust the X-axis label angle. You can choose one of the following options: | Option    | Description                                 |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| Vertical  | Labels right-aligned at a 270 degree angle. |\n| Horizonal | Labels center-aligned at a 0 degree angle.  |\n| Diagonal  | Labels right-aligned at a 315 degree angle. | To set this option: 1. Open the [Customize](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) pane for your chart.\n2. In the Axes section, select a Label Anglefor the X Axis. ## Examples The following chart visualizes data pertaining to movies. Each document in the collection represents a movie and contains general information about the film as well as ratings from critics. This heatmap shows the mean (average) [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/) rating for different movie genres (Y Axis) over time (X Axis): ![Heatmap example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/heatmap-example.png) We [bin](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-bin-data) the years along the X Axis into decades and aggregate to find the mean `metacritic` score of films from each genre released in each decade. The intensity field of `metacritic` shades each grid element based on the mean `metacritic` field of all of the intersecting documents based on the X andY axes fields. Based on the chart, we see that from `1930-1940` there are a few genres with very high average Metacritic scores, and over time a more even distribution of film ratings begins to occur. ## Note If the

## Use Cases Use word clouds to show the frequency of specific words or phrases in text fields. Word clouds provide a high-level view of common words and themes across a series of text data. They can also highlight the most common phrases from a known set of strings, such as product categories or tags. Consider using a word cloud to: * Show common words and phrases used in reviews of a product.\n* Identify common terms in existing content to improveSEO.\n* Highlight specific customer pain points from aggregated user surveys. ## Examples Word clouds are commonly used to show the frequency of words appearing within long text fields. By default, word clouds do not split text fields into words, and instead attempt to visualize the entire text field as a single value. You can use an[aggregation pipeline](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/aggregation-pipeline/#std-label-charts-agg-pipeline) to split a text field into individual words. ## Note The dataset used in this tutorial is included in the`sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews` [dataset provided by Atlas.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/load-sample-data/) The following example creates a word cloud from a dataset containing information on AirBnB rental properties. Each property listing contains a `description` field; a text field describing the property. First, we run an aggregation pipeline to pre-process the `description`field. The following aggregation pipeline: 1. [Splits](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/split/#mongodb-expression-exp.-split) the `description` field into an array where each individual word is an array element.\n2. [Unwinds](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-unwind) this array, creating a new document for each individual word from each `description` field.\n3. [Adds a new field](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/addFields/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-addFields) called `words` to the collection, where each unwound word from the `description` becomes a value of `words`.\n4.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Limit the Rows a Data Table Displays On this page * [Behavior](#behavior)\n* [Procedure](#procedure)\n* [Considerations](#considerations) Users with the `Author` [dashboard role](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-permissions/#std-label-dashboard-roles) can limit the number of rows that a data table displays, thereby limiting the data accessible to viewers. ## Behavior Limiting is off by default. When a row limit is applied to a data table in the[Chart Builder](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/), it is applied to the chart definition. The visible subset of data becomes the entire data set available to viewers. Dashboard viewers can temporarily change the[sort order](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-sort-data), but only the data that initially appears on the chart is re-sorted. ## Example A movie data source provides a ranked list of 100 movies. A chart`Author` chooses to limit the results to 10 and sort in descending rank order to show the top 10 movies. A `Viewer` then sorts the chart into ascending order. The same 10 movies are displayed in ascending order. The user does not have access to the 90 movies that the chart `Author` excluded. ## Procedure To limit the number of rows that a chart displays: 1. Navigate to the Encode tab of the[Chart Builder](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/) and toggleLimit Results to enable it.\n2. Specify the number of rows to show between `1` and `9999`. The default is `10`. ## Considerations The data displayed on a table with a row limit is specific to the[sort order](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/bin-data/#std-label-charts-sort-data) you define in the[Chart Builder](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/). If you change your sorting, you change the data presented in your table. ← [Toggle Data Table Row and Column

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Sort and Resize Data Table Columns On this page * [Behavior](#behavior)\n* [Procedure](#procedure) Users with the viewer and author [roles](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-permissions/#std-label-dashboard-roles)on data tables can sort and resize data table columns. You can sort and resize columns either in the[dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/) or the [Chart Builder.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/) ## Behavior When a viewer or author sorts or resizes columns from the[dashboard](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/) view, the changes do not persist as part of the chart definition. In this case, the chart returns to its original state once the chart or corresponding dashboard is refreshed. To save the changes as part of the chart definition, an author must make the changes in the Chart Builder. All Charts users will see the new column sorting and sizing. ## Procedure ### Sort Columns To sort a data table column, click on its header. With each click, MongoDB Charts cycles between sorting the column in ascending order, descending order, and the default chart sorting order. To sort by multiple columns, Shift + Click on the additional columns by which you wish to sort. Charts applies the sort order in the same order you select additional columns. Charts displays numbers in the column headers indicating the order in which the sorting is applied. ### Resize Columns To resize a column, click the column divider and drag until the column reaches the desired width.

[Docs Home](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) → [MongoDB Charts](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/) # Reorder Data Table Columns On this page * [Behavior](#behavior)\n* [Procedure](#procedure)\n* [Considerations](#considerations) Users with the author and owner [roles](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-permissions/#std-label-dashboard-roles)on data tables can reorder data table columns in the [Chart Builder.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/) ## Behavior When you reorder data table columns and save the chart, MongoDB Charts saves the specified order as part of the chart definition. All Charts users will see the new column order. ### Pinned Columns If you reorder a Group column in a data table that has[pinned columns](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/chart-type-reference/data-table/#std-label-pin-columns), the following behaviors apply: * If the column to the right of the destination is pinned, the reordered column is pinned.\n* If the column to the left of the destination is unpinned, the reordered column is unpinned. ## Procedure To reorder data table columns, click and drag column headers to the desired order. ## Note Data table [authors and owners](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboard-permissions/#std-label-dashboard-roles) can also reorder columns by modifying the order of the respective column[encoding channels](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-encoding-channels). MongoDB Charts renders data table columns in the same order you specify the column encoding channels. To modify the order of the encoding channels, drag and drop one field on top of another to swap their order. ## Considerations * You can only reorder columns within their respective table sections,

Channels](#geospatial-scatter-chart-encoding-channels)\n* [Customization Options](#customization-options)\n* [Tutorials](#tutorials)\n* [Limitations](#limitations) Geospatial scatter charts distribute data from a data source across geographic locations, and, optionally, color the data points based on the database field of your choice and scale the size of data points. The sample images in the next section demonstrate how to construct a geospatial scatter chart to locate the neighborhoods in NYC with the most rooms available at a specified price. ## Geospatial Scatter Chart Encoding Channels Geospatial scatter charts use the Coordinates,Color and Size encoding channels. ### Coordinates The Coordinates encoding channel defines the map area of geospatial charts. The image below distributes all of the instances of the `location` geopoint in the [Sample AirBnB Listings Dataset](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/sample-data/sample-airbnb). However, all of the circles are green and the same size since we have not yet specified fields for the Size and Colorencoding channels. ## Note Atlas provides [several sample data sets](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/sample-data/available-sample-datasets/)for download. See the [Geopoint](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-geopoint-channel) reference page for more information about what types of data you can use in this channel. ![Geospatial scatter coordinates example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/geospatial-scatter-coordinates-example.png) ### Color (_Optional_) The Color encoding channel changes the color of the data points to categorize the displayed geopoints by the value of the selected collection field. MongoDB Charts lists the colors used in a key to the right of the chart. In the image below, the `property_type`distributes the property types in NYC by color. The key to the right of the chart indicates green for guest suites and dark blue for apartments, for example. However, all of the circles are still the same size since we have not yet specified a field for the Size encoding channel. ![Geospatial scatter color example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/geospatial-scatter-color-example.png) ### Size (_Optional_) The Size aggregation encoding channel changes the size of the data point markers, with larger sizes indicating larger aggregated values. The image below uses the mean of the `weekly_price`collection field to aggregate all instances of the geopoint that you chose for the Coordinates encoding channel. The key to right of the chart indicates the aggregation value for the different circle sizes. ![Geospatial scatter size example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/geospatial-scatter-size-example.png) ## Note If no fields are encoded in the Size encoding channel,Charts displays all points with the same size. ### Tooltip Detail _(Optional)_ The Tooltip Detail encoding channel adds the value of the selected field to each data point's tooltip. To view a data point tooltip, hover over that point in the chart. In addition to the Tooltip Detail field, the tooltip also shows other fields used to construct the chart. For example, the following chart encodes the Summaryfield as a Tooltip Detail: ![Geospatial scatter tooltip example](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/images/charts/geospatial-scatter-tooltip-example.png) ## Customization Options The following customization options are specific to geospatial scatter charts. For general customization options, see [Customize Charts.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/#std-label-customize-charts) ### Automatically Set Viewport By default, geospatial charts show a map which includes all the data point markers in your specified collection. You can pan and zoom to change the map view, but if you close the chart and re-open it the map reverts to its default state. This behavior is controlled by theAutomatically Set Viewport option.

### Opacity The Opacity level of a map modifies the degree to which the chart's map data shows through the data point markers. Geospatial scatter charts default to `20%`. ### Stroke Thickness You can set the Stroke Thickness, measured in pixels, of the map's data point markers. The default is `2`. ### Custom Color Palette The color palette specifies the range of colors that corresponds to relative aggregated values in your map. Geospatial scatter charts use a discrete color picker. To enable palette customization, toggle theCustom Color Palette switch in the Generalsection. For more information, see [Color Palette Customization.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/general-customization/#std-label-color-palette-customization) ## Tutorials See the following tutorials to build geospatial scatter charts: * [Create a Geospatial Scatter Chart Using GeoJSON Points](#std-label-create-scatter-chart-geojson)\n* [Create a Geospatial Scatter Chart Using Numeric or Numeric Array Fields](#std-label-create-scatter-chart-numeric) ### Prerequisites The tutorials on this page use the `sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews`and `sample_geospatial.shipwrecks` collections. Before starting, you must load the sample data on your cluster. To learn how to load the sample data provided by Atlas into your cluster, see [Load Sample Data.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/) ### Create a Geospatial Scatter Chart Using GeoJSON Points This tutorial demonstrates how to create a geospatial scatter chart with fields that are [GeoJSON Points](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/geojson/). The final chart displays a scatter chart of AirBnB listings in New York. ## Note Charts automatically determines if field types in your collection are [GeoJSON Points](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/geojson/) by displaying the  icon. You can map these fields directly to a geopoint channel type in the Chart Builder. For more information, see [Geopoint Channel Type.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/encoding-channels/#std-label-geopoint-channel) 1 #### Add a geospatial scatter chart to your dashboard. 1. From the Dashboards page, select the dashboard where you want to add a new chart. For instructions on setting up a dashboard, see [Dashboards.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/)\n2.

### Create a Geospatial Scatter Chart Using Numeric or Numeric Array Fields This tutorial demonstrates how to create a geospatial scatter chart with numeric or numeric array fields. The final chart displays a scatter chart of shipwrecks across the world. 1 #### Add a geospatial scatter chart to your dashboard. 1. From the Dashboards page, select the dashboard where you want to add a new chart. For instructions on setting up a dashboard, see [Dashboards.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/dashboards/)\n2. Click Add Chart.\n3. In the Select Data Source modal, click theProject tab.\n4. In the cluster where you loaded the sample data, select the `shipwrecks` collection in the `sample_geospatial` database.\n5. In the Chart Type dropdown, click Geo Scatter. For more details, see [Create a Chart.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/build-charts/#std-label-create-new-chart) 2 #### Add fields to your chart. 1. Select the Encode tab.\n2. Navigate to the Fields pane on the left side of the Chart Builder. This section lists all available fields in the `shipwrecks` collection.\n3. Drag the `coordinates` numeric array field to theCoordinates encoding channel.  \n## Note  \nAlternatively, you can specify the latitude and longitude coordinates separately. First, drag the `latdec` numeric field to the Coordinates encoding channel. Once theLongitude channel appears, drag the `londec`numeric field to the corresponding channel.\n4. Drag the `feature_type` field to the Color encoding channel.\n5. Drag the `depth` field to the Size encoding channel. Then, in the Aggregate dropdown that appears, set the aggregation method to mean.  \nCharts displays a scatter chart of shipwrecks across the world. The color of each data point corresponds to the shipwreck type, and the size of each point corresponds to the mean shipwreck depth.  \n## Note  \nTo customize colors, click the Customize tab. Under General, enable theCustom Color Palette and set your preferred colors. For more information, see[Color Palette Customization.](https://mongodb.com/docs/charts/customize-charts/general-customization/#std-label-color-palette-customization) 3 #### Save the chart to your dashboard. 1.
