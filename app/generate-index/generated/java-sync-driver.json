If you prefer to connect to MongoDB using a different driver or programming language, see our list of official MongoDB drivers. The Java driver lets you connect to and communicate with MongoDB clusters from a Java application. MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service that hosts your data on MongoDB clusters. In this guide, we show you how to get started with your own free (no credit card required) cluster. Consult the following steps to connect your Java application with a MongoDB Atlas cluster. \nSET UP YOUR PROJECT  INSTALL THE JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT (JDK) \nMake sure that your system has JDK 8 or later installed. For more information on how to check your version of Java and install the JDK, see the Oracle Overview of JDK Installation documentation. \nCREATE THE PROJECT \nThis guide shows you how to add the MongoDB Java driver dependencies using Maven or Gradle. We recommend that you use an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Intellij IDEA or Eclipse IDE make it more convenient to configure Maven or Gradle to build and run your project. If you are not using an IDE, see Building Maven or Creating New Gradle Builds for more information on how to set up your project. \nADD MONGODB AS A DEPENDENCY \nIf you are using Maven, add the following to your pom.xml dependencies list: <dependencies>    <dependency>        <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>        <artifactId>mongodb-driver-sync</artifactId>        <version>4.9.0</version>    </dependency></dependencies>  If you are using Gradle, add the following to your build.gradle dependencies list: dependencies {  implementation 'org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-sync:4.9.0'}  Once you configure your dependencies, ensure they are available to your project which may require running your dependency manager and refreshing the project in your IDE. \nCREATE A MONGODB CLUSTER  SET UP A FREE TIER CLUSTER IN ATLAS \nAfter setting up your Java project dependencies, create a MongoDB cluster where you can store and manage your data. Complete the Get Started with Atlas guide to set up a new Atlas account, create and launch a free tier MongoDB cluster, load datasets, and interact with the data. After completing the steps in the Atlas guide, you should have a new MongoDB cluster deployed in Atlas, a new database user, and sample datasets loaded into your cluster. CONNECT TO YOUR CLUSTER \nIn this step, we create and run an application that uses the MongoDB Java driver to connect to your MongoDB cluster and run a query on the sample data. We pass instructions to the driver on how to connect to your MongoDB cluster in a string called the connection string. This string includes information on the hostname or IP address and port of your cluster, authentication mechanism, user credentials when applicable, and other connection options. If you are connecting to an instance or cluster that is not hosted by Atlas, see Other Ways to Connect to MongoDB for instructions on how to format your connection string. To retrieve your connection string for the cluster and user you created in the previous step, log into your Atlas account and navigate to the Database section and click the Connect button for the cluster that you want to connect to as shown below.  Proceed to the Connect Your Application step and select the Java driver. Select \"4.1 or Later\" for the version. Click the Copy icon to copy the connection string to your clipboard as shown below.  Save your Atlas connection string in a safe location that you can access for the next step. \nQUERY YOUR MONGODB CLUSTER FROM YOUR APPLICATION \nNext, create a file to contain your application called QuickStart.java in the base package directory of your project.

 When you run the QuickStart class, it should output the details of the movie from the sample dataset which will look something like this: {  _id: ...,  plot: 'A young man is accidentally sent 30 years into the past...',  genres: [ 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi' ],  ...  title: 'Back to the Future',  ...} If you receive no output or an error, check whether you included the proper connection string in your Java class, and whether you loaded the sample dataset into your MongoDB Atlas cluster. \nIMPORTANT \nKNOWN CONNECTION ISSUE WHEN USING TLS V1.3 If you encounter an error connecting to your MongoDB instance or cluster that resembles the following while running your application, you may need to update your JDK to the latest patch release: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: extension (5) should not be presented in certificate_request This exception is a known issue when using the TLS 1.3 protocol with specific versions of JDK, but was fixed for the following releases:      * JDK 11.0.7  * JDK 13.0.3  * JDK 14.0.2 To resolve this error, update your JDK to one of the preceding patch versions or a newer one. After completing this step, you should have a working application that uses the Java driver to connect to your MongoDB cluster, run a query on the sample data, and print out the result. \nWORKING WITH POJOS (OPTIONAL) \nIn the previous section, you ran a query on a sample collection to retrieve data in the map-like class Document. In this section, you can learn to use your own Plain Old Java Object (POJO) to store and retrieve data from MongoDB. Create a file called Movie.java in the base package directory of your project and add the following code for a class that includes the following fields, setters, and getters: public class Movie {    String plot;    List<String> genres;    String title;\n    public String getPlot() {        return plot;    }    public void setPlot(String plot) {        this.plot = plot;    }    public List<String> getGenres() {        return genres;    }    public void setGenres(List<String> genres) {        this.genres = genres;    }    public String getTitle() {        return title;    }    public void setTitle(String title) {        this.title = title;    }    @Override    public String toString() {        return \"Movie [\\n  plot=\" + plot + \",\\n  genres=\" + genres + \",\\n  title=\" + title + \"\\n]\";    }}  Create a new file QuickStartPojoExample.java in the same package directory as your Movie file in your project. Use the following sample code to run a query on your sample dataset in MongoDB Atlas, replacing the value of the uri variable with your MongoDB Atlas connection string.

We wanted to ensure that the new CRUD API was available in a Java package structure that would work well with Java module support introduced in Java 9. \nWHICH TYPE OF MONGOCLIENT SHOULD I USE? \nNew applications should generally use the com.mongodb.client.MongoClient interface, which supports:      * Configuration with MongoClientSettings and ConnectionString. You can create instances of this interface via factory methods defined in the com.mongodb.client.MongoClients class.  * CRUD API using MongoDatabase, and from there, MongoCollection You should use the com.mongodb.MongoClient class if you require support for the legacy API, which supports:  * Configuration with MongoClientOptions and MongoClientURI  * CRUD API using DB, and from there, DBCollection. You can access this API via the getDB() method. For applications that require a mix of the new and legacy APIs, com.mongodb.MongoClient also supports:  * Configuration with MongoClientSettings and ConnectionString, the only difference being that you create instances via constructors instead of a factory class.  * CRUD API using MongoDatabase, and from there, MongoCollection. You can access this API via the getDatabase() method. \nHOW DO I USE THE MONGOCLIENTSETTINGS CLASS? \nYou can use the MongoClientSettings class to specify configurations for MongoClient instances. To construct MongoClientSettings instances, use the MongoClientSettings.Builder class. Here are the sections of our documentation that show how to perform different tasks with the MongoClientSettings class:  * Specify Multiple Hosts  * Enable TLS/SSL  * Authenticate with Credentials  * Enable Compression  * Add Listeners For Driver and Database Events  * Get the Default Codec Registry For more information on the MongoClientSettings class, see the API Documentation for MongoClientSettings. \nHOW DO I FIX: \"JAVAX.NET.SSL.SSLHANDSHAKEEXCEPTION: EXTENSION (5) SHOULD NOT BE PRESENTED IN CERTIFICATE_REQUEST\"? \nThis is a known error that can occur when using the TLS 1.3 protocol with specific versions of the JDK. If you encounter this error when connecting to your MongoDB instance or cluster, update your JDK to one of the following patch versions or newer:  * JDK 11.0.7  * JDK 13.0.3  * JDK 14.0.2 \nPOJOS  DO I HAVE TO SPECIFY AN ID FIELD VALUE MYSELF? \nNo, the PojoCodecProvider automatically generates an ObjectId. \nCAN THE ID FIELD BE A COMPOUND KEY? \nYes.

For example, if you have an Event class that you extend in Java (e.g. MachineEvent or NetworkEvent), using a discriminator identifies which class the PojoCodecProvider should use to serialize/deserialize the document. For more information, see our POJO Customization guide. \nCAN I CONTROL SERIALIZATION OF LOCALDATE? \nYes, the 3.7 Java driver adds native support for JSR-310 Instant, LocalDate & LocalDateTime. \nCAN I SERIALIZE A JAVA.UTIL.DATE AS A STRING IN FORMAT YYYY-MM-DD? \nYes, you can build your own codec for this class and add it to the registry. Add the codec to the first in the list of providers, before the default codec registry and before the PojoCodecProvider: CodecRegistry registry = CodecRegistries.fromRegistries(        CodecRegistries.fromCodecs(                new MyDateAsStringCodec()),        MongoClientSettings.getDefaultCodecRegistry(),        fromProviders(pojoCodecProvider));  \nCAN I MAKE POJOS READ/WRITE DIRECTLY TO THE FIELD AND NOT USE THE GETTERS/SETTERS AT ALL? \nYou can configure the PojoCodecProvider to use the SET_PRIVATE_FIELDS_CONVENTION, which sets a private field through reflection if no public setter is available. \nCAN I MIX PRIVATE, PROTECTED, AND PUBLIC SETTERS AND GETTERS? \nNo. The native POJO codec assumes that getters/setters have the same modifiers for each field. For example, the following methods throws an exception during encoding: private String getField();public String setField(String x);  \nHOW DO I FIX: \"ORG.BSON.CODECS.CONFIGURATION.CODECCONFIGURATIONEXCEPTION: CAN'T FIND A CODEC FOR CLASS X.\"? \nThis exception means you need to register a codec for the class since there is none at the moment. \nHOW DO I SPECIFY THE COLLECTION NAME FOR A PARTICULAR POJO CLASS? IS THERE AN ANNOTATION? \nThere is no annotation. We recommend adding a static string in your class as shown: public class Person {   public static final String COLLECTION_NAME = \"people\";}  The following snippet specifies the collection name for a particular POJO class: database.getCollection(Person.COLLECTION_NAME, Person.class);  \nLEGACY API  HOW DO I CONNECT TO MY MONGODB INSTANCE WITH THE LEGACY API? \nThe following example shows how to connect to a MongoDB instance with the legacy API and the current API.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nWHAT'S NEW \nOn this page    \n * What's New in 4.9\n   \n * What's New in 4.8\n * What's New in 4.7.1\n * What's New in 4.7\n * What's New in 4.6\n * What's New in 4.5\n * What's New in 4.4\n * What's New in 4.3\n * What's New in 4.2\n * What's New in 4.1\n * What's New in 4.0 Learn what's new in:      * Version 4.9  * Version 4.8  * Version 4.7.1  * Version 4.7.0  * Version 4.6  * Version 4.5  * Version 4.4  * Version 4.3  * Version 4.2  * Version 4.1  * Version 4.0 \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.9 \n * Added a new exception to identify when a constructor annotated by BsonCreator contains parameters with annotations other than BsonProperty or BsonId.  * Changed the log message format for command monitoring messages reported by the org.mongodb.driver.protocol.command package.  * Added support for the $documents aggregation pipeline stage to the Aggregates helper class.  * Added MongoClientSettings.Builder.applyToLoggerSettings() and LoggerSettings.Builder.maxDocumentLength() methods that let you specify a maximum length for the extended JSON representation of a BSON document in a log message. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.8 \n * The 4.8 driver ends support for MongoDB v3.4 and earlier. To learn more about breaking changes in this driver version and how to address them, see Version 4.8 Server Release Support Changes.  * The RecordCodec now deserializes POJOs and record classes that are specified as type parameters of List and Map fields of a record as their respective classes. To learn more about this change and how this may affect the behavior of your application, see Version 4.8 Breaking Changes. \nIMPORTANT \nDEPRECATION NOTICE The IterableCodec and MapCodec classes are deprecated. Instead, use CollectionCodec and MapCodecV2. These support any class that implements Collection or Map. Behavioral changes with the 4.8 driver release include:  * Requirement that you add an explicit dependency on the org.bson.codecs.record module if your application deploys the driver in an OSGi container and relies on the driver for encoding and decoding Java records.  * Logging of new connection messages at the DEBUG level instead of at INFO. New features of the 4.8 driver release include:  * Support for authentication with AWS. The driver takes an optional dependency on both AWS SDK version 1 and version 2.  * Support for obtaining credentials from the environment for both GCP and Azure for in-use encryption.  * Support for deserialization of records containing components with generic parameters.  * Support for deserialization of records containing components with more specific container types, such as SortedSet, NavigableMap, LinkedList, or TreeSet.  * Support for recursive record types, records whose type definitions contain cycles.  * Inclusion of the disambiguatedPaths field in change stream update events when the showExpandedEvents server feature is enabled on MongoDB v6.1 and later. Learn more about this field from the getDisambiguatedPaths() API documentation. Learn more about the showExpandedEvents setting from the Expanded Events server documentation. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.7.1 \nThe 4.7.1 driver patches a bug that affects Client-Side Field Level Encryption and Queryable Encryption. The bug can cause data corruption when rotating Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) encrypted with a Customer Master Key hosted on Google Cloud Key Management Service or Azure Key Vault. The bug was present in version 4.7.0 of the driver in the RewrapManyDataKey method and causes the loss of your DEKs. \nIMPORTANT \nBACK UP YOUR KEY VAULT COLLECTION Always back up your Key Vault Collection before you rotate your DEKs.

 * Added clustered index creation support.  * Support for new features related to Queryable Encryption, including support for automatic encryption (MongoDB v6.0 Enterprise or later is required) and manual encryption.\n   \n   * Support for the new Queryable Encryption shared library, which removes the need for the mongocryptd process. The queryable encryption shared library requires org.mongodb:mongodb-crypt version 1.5.1.1 or later.  * Added a new API for encryption key management.  * Added builder API methods for additional aggregation stages including $search/$searchMeta (Atlas only), $densify, and $fill. Learn more about these methods on the Aggregates Builder page.  * Added the BsonExtraElements annotation that can be used with POJO encoding and decoding. BsonExtraElements enables decoding objects that may receive new fields in the future without requiring developers to explicitly map those new fields.  * Performance optimizations including:\n   \n   * Lock-free implementations of the server session pool and the buffer pool.\n   \n   * A new cleanup implementation of DBCursor that uses Java's Cleaner API instead of finalization, available in Java 9 or later.  * The setWindowFields builder API is no longer a beta feature. Changes in the API break both binary and source compatibility. See Version 4.7 Breaking Changes for more information. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.6 \nNew features of the 4.6 Java driver release include:  * The buffer pool is now shared across all MongoClient instances. The buffer pool prunes buffers that have been idle for one minute.  * Added an API to specify suppliers for AWS KMS credentials for Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE). See the AutoEncryptionSettings.Builder.kmsProviderPropertySuppliers() and the ClientEncryptionSettings.Builder.kmsProviderPropertySuppliers() API documentation for more information.  * Added compatibility to org.mongodb:mongodb-crypt, a dependency for CSFLE, for Apple M1 ARM-based hardware.  * Added a service provider interface (SPI) to allow the driver to specify a custom DNS client. See the DnsClient and the DnsClientProvider interface API documentation for more information.  * Added driver support for encoding and decoding between Java records and BSON documents, which is enabled by default. See Document Data Format: Records for more information. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.5 \nNew features of the 4.5 Java driver release include:  * Added support for specifying custom service names of SRV resource records. See the srvServiceName setting in the Connection Options guide for more information.  * Added support to customize UUID representation in a codec registry using the CodecRegistries.withUuidRepresentation() method.  * Added support for overriding listener settings in ClusterSettings, ServerSettings and ConnectionPoolSettings builders.  * All events received by ClusterListener, ServerListener, and ServerMonitorListener are now totally ordered using a happens-before relationship when the listeners are not shared by different MongoClient instances. To learn more about the happens-before ordering, see Happens-before Order in the Java Language Specification.  * Added EnumCodec and EnumCodecProvider classes to separate codec support for enum types from the PojoCodec class. The default codec registries, accessible from the MongoClientSettings and the Bson interfaces, now include the enum codec classes. If your application uses a custom enumeration codec and one of the default registries, ensure you order them as described in the section on overriding codecs.  * Resolved performance issues that impacted versions 4.4 and 4.3 of the driver. Performance in this version should be similar to performance in 4.2.  * Resolved an issue in which errors originating from retrieving the cluster description weren't passed to the onError Subscriber callback  * Resolved an issue with releasing ByteBuf instances when you connect with compression enabled.  * Removed an unnecessary dependency on the javax.annotation.* packages from the org.mongodb.driver-core OSGi bundle. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.4 \nNew features of the 4.4 Java driver release include:  * Compatibility with MongoDB 5.1 and support for Java 17  * Added support for index hints in an AggregateIterable  * Added support for the $merge and $out aggregation stages on secondaries  * Use of the mergeObjects() method in the Updates builder  * DocumentCodec does not ignore a

Docs Home → Java Sync \nUPGRADE DRIVER VERSIONS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Breaking Changes\n * Server Release Compatibility Changes \nOVERVIEW \nIn this section, you can identify the changes you need to make to your application to upgrade your driver to a new version. Before you upgrade, perform the following actions:      * Ensure the new version is compatible with the MongoDB server versions your application connects to and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) your application runs on. See the Java Compatibility page for this information.  * Address any breaking changes between the current version of the driver your application is using and your planned upgrade version in the Breaking Changes section. To learn more about the MongoDB server release compatibility changes, see the Server Release Compatibility Changes section. \nTIP To minimize the amount of changes your application may require when upgrading driver versions in the future, use the Stable API. \nBREAKING CHANGES \nA breaking change is a modification in a convention or behavior in a specific version of the driver that may prevent your application from working properly if not addressed before upgrading. The breaking changes in this section are categorized by the driver version that introduced them. When upgrading driver versions, address all the breaking changes between the current and upgrade versions. For example, if you are upgrading the driver from v4.0 to v4.5, address all breaking changes from the version after v4.0 including any listed under v4.5. \nVERSION 4.8 BREAKING CHANGES \n * The driver ends support for connecting to MongoDB server versions v3.4 and earlier. To learn more about this change, see the Version 4.8 Server Release Support Changes section.  * You must add an explicit dependency on the org.bson.codecs.record module if your application deploys the driver in an OSGi container and relies on the driver for encoding and decoding Java records.  * The RecordCodec, implemented in v4.6, deserialized POJOs and record classes that are specified as type parameters of List or Map fields of a record as Document values instead of their respective classes. This version now deserializes them to the proper record and POJO types.\n   \n   For example, the following record class definitions show a Book record that contains a List that receives a Chapter type parameter:\n   \n   public record Book(String title, List<Chapter> chapters) {}public record Chapter(Integer number, String text) {}\n   \n   \n   \n   Starting in this version, the codec deserializes data in the List into Chapter record classes instead of Document values. \nVERSION 4.7 BREAKING CHANGES \n * The setWindowFields builder API is no longer beta. The new builder breaks binary and source compatibility. See the Aggregates API documentation for information the new setWindowFields() method signatures.\n   \n   If your application uses this builder in a version prior to v4.7, update your source code to use the new method signature and rebuild your binary. \nVERSION 4.2 BREAKING CHANGES \n * The ObjectId class and its serialVersionUID field were updated to use a new format that minimizes serialization compatibility issues across different versions of the driver.\n   \n   If an application using this version or later of the driver attempts to perform Java Object Serialization on any objects that contain an ObjectId and were serialized by a prior version of the driver, Java throws an InvalidClassException.\n   \n   To learn more about Java Object Serialization, see the Java Documentation on Serializable Objects. \nVERSION 4.0 BREAKING CHANGES \n * Several classes and methods marked as deprecated in the 3.12 release were removed in this version.  * The insert helper methods return an insert result object instead of void.  * The toJson() methods on BsonDocument, Document, and DbObject return a relaxed JSON format instead of a strict JSON format. This makes the JSON documents more readable, but can make it more difficult to identify the BSON type information, such as the difference between a 32-bit and 64-bit integer. If your application relies on the strict JSON format, use the strict mode when reading or writing data. Learn how to specify the JSON format in the current API in the Document Data Format: Extended JSON guide.  * The default BSON representation of java.util.UUID value was changed from JAVA_LEGACY to UNSPECIFIED. Applications that store or retrieve UUID values must explicitly specify which representation to use.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nCOUNT DOCUMENTS \nThere are two instance methods in the MongoCollection class that you can call to count the number of documents in a collection:      * countDocuments() returns the number of documents in the collection that match a specified query. If you specify an empty query filter, the method returns the total number of documents in the collection.  * estimatedDocumentCount() returns an estimation of the number of documents in the collection based on the collection metadata. You cannot specify a query when using this method. The estimatedDocumentCount() method returns more quickly than the countDocuments() method because it uses the collection's metadata rather than scanning the entire collection. The countDocuments() method returns an accurate count of the number of documents and supports specifying a filter. When you call the countDocuments() method, you can optionally pass a query filter parameter. You cannot pass any parameters when you call estimatedDocumentCount(). \nIMPORTANT \nSTABLE API V1 AND MONGODB SERVER ISSUE If you are using the Stable API V1 with the \"strict\" option and a MongoDB server version between 5.0.0 and 5.0.8 inclusive, method calls to estimatedDocumentCount() may error due to a server bug. Upgrade to MongoDB server 5.0.9 or set the Stable API \"strict\" option to false to avoid this issue. You can also pass an optional parameter to either of these methods to specify the behavior of the call: Method\nOptional Parameter Class\nDescription\ncountDocuments()\nCountOptions\nYou can specify a maximum number of documents to count by using the limit() method or the maximum amount of execution time using the maxTime() method.\nestimatedDocumentCount()\nEstimatedDocumentCountOptions\nYou can specify the maximum execution time using the maxTime() method. Both methods return the number of matching documents as a long primitive. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example estimates the number of documents in the movies collection in the sample_mflix database, and then returns an accurate count of the number of documents in the movies collection with Canada in the countries field. \nNOTE This example connects to an instance of MongoDB using a connection URI.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nFIND A DOCUMENT \nYou can retrieve a single document in a collection by chaining together the find() and first() methods on a MongoCollection object. You can pass a query filter to the find() method to query for and return documents that match the filter in the collection. If you do not include a filter, MongoDB returns all the documents in the collection. The first() method returns the first matching document. For more information on querying MongoDB with the Java driver, see our guide on Querying Documents. You can also chain other methods to the find() method such as sort() which organizes the matched documents in a specified order, and projection() which configures the fields included in the returned documents. For more information on the sort() method, see our guide on Sorting. For more information on the projection() method, see our guide on Projections The find() method returns an instance of FindIterable, a class that offers several methods to access, organize, and traverse the results. FindIterable also inherits methods from its parent class, MongoIterable such as first(). The first() method returns the first document from the retrieved results or null if there are no results. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following snippet finds a single document from the movies collection. It uses the following objects and methods:      * A query filter that is passed to the find() method. The eq filter matches only movies with the title exactly matching the text 'The Room'.  * A sort that organizes matched documents in descending order by rating, so if our query matches multiple documents the returned document is the one with the highest rating.  * A projection that includes the objects in the title and imdb fields and excludes the _id field using the helper method excludeId(). \nNOTE This example connects to an instance of MongoDB using a connection URI.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nPERFORM BULK OPERATIONS \nThe bulkWrite() method performs batch write operations against a single collection. This method reduces the number of network round trips from your application to your MongoDB instance which increases the performance of your application. Since you only receive the success status after all the operations return, we recommend you use this if that meets the requirements of your use case. You can specify one or more of the following write operations in bulkWrite():      * insertOne  * updateOne  * updateMany  * deleteOne  * deleteMany  * replaceOne The bulkWrite() method accepts the following parameters:  * A List of objects that implement WriteModel: the classes that implement WriteModel correspond to the aforementioned write operations. E.g. the InsertOneModel class wraps the insertOne write operation. See the links to the API documentation at the bottom of this page for more information on each class.  * BulkWriteOptions: optional object that specifies settings such as whether to ensure your MongoDB instance orders your write operations. \nNOTE Retryable writes run on MongoDB server versions 3.6 or later in bulk write operations unless they include one or more instances of UpdateManyModel or DeleteManyModel. \nTIP By default, MongoDB executes bulk write operations one-by-one in the specified order (i.e. serially). During an ordered bulk write, if an error occurs during the processing of an operation, MongoDB returns without processing the remaining operations in the list. In contrast, when you set ordered to false, MongoDB continues to process remaining write operations in the list in the event of an error. Unordered operations are theoretically faster since MongoDB can execute them in parallel, but you should only use them if your writes do not depend on order. The bulkWrite() method returns a BulkWriteResult object that contains information about the write operation results including the number of documents inserted, modified, and deleted. If one or more of your operations attempts to set a value that violates a unique index on your collection, an exception is raised that should look something like this: The bulk write operation failed due to an error: Bulk write operation error on server <hostname>. Write errors: [BulkWriteError{index=0, code=11000, message='E11000 duplicate key error collection: ... }]. Similarly, if you attempt to perform a bulk write against a collection that uses schema validation and one or more of your write operations provide an unexpected format, you may encounter exceptions. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following code sample performs an ordered bulk write operation on the movies collection in the sample_mflix database.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nUPDATE A DOCUMENT \nYou can update a single document using the updateOne() method on a MongoCollection object. The method accepts a filter that matches the document you want to update and an update statement that instructs the driver how to change the matching document. The updateOne() method only updates the first document that matches the filter. To perform an update with the updateOne() method, you must pass a query filter and an update document. The query filter specifies the criteria for which document to perform the update on and the update document provides instructions on what changes to make to it. You can optionally pass an instance of UpdateOptions to the updateOne() method in order to specify the method's behavior. For example, if you set the upsert field of the UpdateOptions object to true, the operation inserts a new document from the fields in both the query and update document if no documents match the query filter. See the link to the UpdateOptions API documentation at the bottom of this page for more information. Upon successful execution, the updateOne() method returns an instance of UpdateResult. You can retrieve information such as the number of documents modified by calling the getModifiedCount() method, or the value of the _id field by calling the getUpsertedId() method if you specified upsert(true) in an UpdateOptions instance. If your update operation fails, the driver raises an exception. For example, if you try to set a value for the immutable field _id in your update document, the method throws a MongoWriteException with the message: Performing an update on the path '_id' would modify the immutable field '_id' If your update document contains a change that violates unique index rules, the method throws a MongoWriteException with an error message that should look something like this: E11000 duplicate key error collection: ... For more information on the types of exceptions raised under specific conditions, see the API documentation for updateOne(), linked at the bottom of this page. \nEXAMPLE \nIn this example, we update the first match for our query in the movies collection of the sample_mflix database. We perform the following updates to the matching document:      * Set the value of runtime to 99  * Add Sports to the array of genres only if it does not already exist  * Set the value of lastUpdated to the current time. We use the Updates builder, a factory class that contains static helper methods, to construct the update document. While you can pass an update document instead of using the builder, the builder provides type checking and simplified syntax. For more information on the Updates builder, see our guide on the Updates builder. \nNOTE This example connects to an instance of MongoDB using a connection URI.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nREPLACE A DOCUMENT \nYou can replace a single document using the replaceOne() method on a MongoCollection object. This method removes all the existing fields and values from a document (except the _id field) and substitutes it with your replacement document. The replaceOne() method accepts a query filter that matches the document you want to replace and a replacement document that contains the data you want to save in place of the matched document. The replaceOne() method only replaces the first document that matches the filter. You can optionally pass an instance of ReplaceOptions to the replaceOne() method in order to specify the method's behavior. For example, if you set the upsert field of the ReplaceOptions object to true, the operation inserts a new document from the fields in the replacement document if no documents match the query filter. See the link to the ReplaceOptions API documentation at the bottom of this page for more information. Upon successful execution, the replaceOne() method returns an instance of UpdateResult. You can retrieve information such as the number of documents modified by calling the getModifiedCount() method. You can also retrieve the value of the document's _id field by calling the getUpsertedId() method if you set upsert(true) in the ReplaceOptions instance and the operation resulted in the insertion of a new document. If your replacement operation fails, the driver raises an exception. For example, if you try to specify a value for the immutable field _id in your replacement document that differs from the original document, the method throws a MongoWriteException with the message: After applying the update, the (immutable) field '_id' was found to have been altered to _id: ObjectId('...) If your replacement document contains a change that violates unique index rules, the method throws a MongoWriteException with an error message that should look something like this: E11000 duplicate key error collection: ... For more information on the types of exceptions raised under specific conditions, see the API documentation for replaceOne(), linked at the bottom of this page. \nEXAMPLE \nIn this example, we replace the first match of our query filter in the movies collection of the sample_mflix database with a replacement document. All the fields except for the _id field are deleted from the original document and are substituted by the replacement document. Before the replaceOne() operation runs, the original document contains several fields describing the movie. After the operation runs, the resulting document contains only the fields specified by the replacement document (title and fullplot) and the _id field. The following snippet uses the following objects and methods:      * A query filter that is passed to the replaceOne() method. The eq filter matches only movies with the title exactly matching the text 'Music of the Heart'.  * A replacement document that contains the document that replaces the matching document if it exists.  * A ReplaceOptions object with the upsert option set to true. This option specifies that the method should insert the data contained in the replacement document if the query filter does not match any documents. \nNOTE This example connects to an instance of MongoDB using a connection URI.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nUPDATE MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS \nYou can update multiple documents using the updateMany() method on a MongoCollection object. The method accepts a filter that matches the document you want to update and an update statement that instructs the driver how to change the matching document. The updateMany() method updates all the documents in the collection that match the filter. To perform an update with the updateMany() method, you must pass a query filter and an update document. The query filter specifies which documents in the collection to match and the update document provides instructions on what changes to make to them. You can optionally pass an instance of UpdateOptions to the updateMany() method in order to modify the behavior of the call. For example, if you set the upsert field of the UpdateOptions object to true and no documents match the specified query filter, the operation inserts a new document composed of the fields from both the query and update document. Upon successful execution, the updateMany() method returns an instance of UpdateResult. You can retrieve information such as the number of documents modified by calling the getModifiedCount() method. If you specified upsert(true) in an UpdateOptions object and the operation results in an insert, you can retrieve the _id field of the new document by calling the getUpsertedId() method on the UpdateResult instance. If your update operation fails, the driver raises an exception and does not update any of the documents matching the filter. For example, if you try to set a value for the immutable field _id in your update document, the updateMany() method does not update any documents and throws a MongoWriteException with the message: Performing an update on the path '_id' would modify the immutable field '_id' If your update document contains a change that violates unique index rules, the method throws a MongoWriteException with an error message that should look something like this: E11000 duplicate key error collection: ... For more information on the types of exceptions raised under specific conditions, see the API documentation for updateMany(), linked at the bottom of this page. \nEXAMPLE \nIn this example, we update documents that match our query in the movies collection of the sample_mflix database. We perform the following updates to the matching documents:      * Add Frequently Discussed to the array of genres only if it does not already exist  * Set the value of lastUpdated to the current time. We use the Updates builder, a factory class that contains static helper methods to construct the update document. While you can pass an update document instead of using the builder, the builder provides type checking and simplified syntax.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nFIND MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS \nYou can query for multiple documents in a collection by calling the find() method on a MongoCollection object. Pass a query filter to the find() method to query for and return documents that match the filter in the collection. If you do not include a filter, MongoDB returns all the documents in the collection. For more information on querying MongoDB with the Java driver, see our guide on Querying Documents. You can also chain methods to the find() method such as sort() which organizes the matched documents in a specified order and projection() which configures the included fields in the returned documents. For more information on the sort() method, see our guide on Sorting. For more information on the projection() method, see our guide on Projections The find() method returns an instance of FindIterable, a class that offers several methods to access, organize, and traverse the results. FindIterable also inherits methods from its parent class, MongoIterable which implements the core Java interface Iterable. You can call the iterator() method on the MongoIterable which returns a MongoCursor instance that you can use to traverse the results. You can call methods on the MongoCursor such as hasNext() to check whether additional results exist, or next() to return the next document in the collection. If no documents match the query, calling hasNext() returns false and therefore calling next() throws an exception. If you call next() on the iterator either after it has returned the final result or when no results exist, it throws an exception of type java.util.NoSuchElementException. Always use hasNext() to check that additional results exist before you call next(). \nEXAMPLE \nThe following snippet finds and prints all documents that match a query on the movies collection. It uses the following objects and methods:      * A query filter that is passed to the find() method. The lt() filter matches only movies with a runtime of less than 15 minutes.  * A sort that organizes returned documents in descending order by title (\"Z\" before \"A\").  * A projection that includes the objects in the title and imdb fields and excludes the _id field using the helper method excludeId(). \nNOTE This example connects to an instance of MongoDB using a connection URI.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nWATCH FOR CHANGES \nYou can keep track of changes to data in MongoDB, such as changes to a collection, database, or deployment, by opening a change stream. A change stream allows applications to watch for changes to data and react to them. The change stream returns change event documents when changes occur. A change event contains information about the updated data. Open a change stream by calling the watch() method on a MongoCollection, MongoDatabase, or MongoClient object as shown in the following code example: ChangeStreamIterable<Document> changeStream = database.watch();  The watch() method optionally takes an aggregation pipeline which consists of an array of stages as the first parameter to filter and transform the change event output as follows: List<Bson> pipeline = Arrays.asList(                        Aggregates.match(                           Filters.lt(\"fullDocument.runtime\", 15)));ChangeStreamIterable<Document> changeStream = database.watch(pipeline);  The watch() method returns an instance of ChangeStreamIterable, a class that offers several methods to access, organize, and traverse the results. ChangeStreamIterable also inherits methods from its parent class, MongoIterable which implements the core Java interface Iterable. You can call forEach() on the ChangeStreamIterable to handle events as they occur, or you can use the iterator() method which returns a MongoCursor instance that you can use to traverse the results. You can call methods on the MongoCursor such as hasNext() to check whether additional results exist, next() to return the next document in the collection, or tryNext(), to immediately return either the next available element in the change stream or null. Unlike the MongoCursor returned by other queries, a MongoCursor associated with a change stream waits until a change event arrives before returning a result from next(). As a result, calls to next() using a change stream's MongoCursor never throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException. To configure options for processing the documents returned from the change stream, use member methods of the ChangeStreamIterable object returned by watch(). See the link to the ChangeStreamIterable API documentation at the bottom of this example for more details on the available methods. \nHOW TO PROCESS CHANGE STREAM EVENTS WITH A CALLBACK \nTo capture events from a change stream, call the forEach() method with a callback function as shown below: changeStream.forEach(event -> System.out.println(\"Change observed: \" + event));  The callback function triggers when a change event is emitted. You can specify logic in the callback to process the event document when it is received. \nIMPORTANT \nFOREACH() BLOCKS THE CURRENT THREAD Calls to forEach() block the current thread as long as the corresponding change stream listens for events. If your program needs to continue executing other logic, such as processing requests or responding to user input, consider creating and listening to your change stream in a separate thread. \nNOTE For update operation change events, change streams only return the modified fields by default rather than the entire updated document. You can configure your change stream to also return the most current version of the document by calling the fullDocument() member method of the ChangeStreamIterable object with the value FullDocument.UPDATE_LOOKUP as follows: ChangeStreamIterable<Document> changeStream = database.watch()          .fullDocument(FullDocument.UPDATE_LOOKUP);  \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example uses two separate applications to demonstrate how to listen for changes using a change stream:      * The first application, named Watch, opens a change stream on the movies collection in the sample_mflix database. Watch uses an aggregation pipeline to filter changes based on operationType so that it only receives insert and update events (deletes are excluded by omission). Watch uses a callback to receive and print the filtered change events that occur on the collection.  * The second application, named WatchCompanion, inserts a single document into the movies collection in the sample_mflix database. Next, WatchCompanion updates the document with a new field value. Finally, WatchCompanion deletes the document. First, run Watch to open the change stream on the collection and define a callback on the change stream using the forEach() method.

Example - Names \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to set up and configure a logger in the MongoDB Java driver. You will learn how to:      * Set up a logger using the Simple Logging Facade For Java (SLF4J)  * Configure the log level of your logger This guide shows how to record events in the driver. If you would like to learn how to use information about the activity of the driver in code, consider reading our guide on monitoring. \nSET UP A LOGGER \nThis section gives background on the dependencies necessary to set up a logger and provides an example logger setup. \nBACKGROUND \nThe MongoDB Java driver uses the Simple Logging Facade For Java (SLF4J). SLF4J allows you to specify your logging framework of choice at deployment time. For more information on SLF4J, see the SLF4J documentation. Setting up a logger is optional. When you start your application the MongoDB Java driver looks for the slf4j-api artifact in your classpath. If the driver can't find the slf4j-api artifact, the driver logs the following warning with java.util.logging and disables all further logging: WARNING: SLF4J not found on the classpath.  Logging is disabled for the 'org.mongodb.driver' component To set up a logger, you must include the following in your project.  * The slf4j-api artifact  * A logging framework  * A binding \nNOTE For the most popular logging frameworks, there is often a single binding artifact that lists the slf4j-api and the logging framework as dependencies. This means that you can set up a logger by adding one artifact to your project's dependency list. You will see this in the example below. A binding is a piece of code that connects the slf4j-api artifact with a logging framework. The following example shows how to bind the slf4j-api artifact to the two most popular logging frameworks, Log4j2 and Logback. \nEXAMPLE - SET UP \nThis example shows how to set up your logger. Click the tab corresponding to the logging framework you would like to use in your project. \nTIP \nDEPENDENCY VERSIONS The following versions listed are illustrative rather than a source of truth. You should check the official documentation for SLF4J and your logging framework of choice for guaranteed up-to-date version information.  * SLF4J documentation  * Logback documentation  * Log4j2 documentation   CONFIGURE YOUR LOGGER \nTo configure your logger, you must use the configuration system of the logging framework bound to SLF4J. In the following example we show how you can use your logging framework's configuration system to set your logger's log level. A logger's log level specifies a lower bound for how urgent a message must be for the logger to output that message. \nEXAMPLE - CONFIGURE \nThis example shows how to configure your logger's log level to INFO. Select the tab corresponding to the logging framework you are using in your project.   LOGGER NAMES \nYour logger uses logger names to help organize different logging events. Logger names are strings that form a hierarchy. A logger is an ancestor of another logger if its name followed by a \".\" is a prefix of the other logger's name. For example, \"grandparent\" is an ancestor of \"grandparent.parent\" which is an ancestor of \"grandparent.parent.child\". For a concrete example, this is what a logger hierarchy looks like in code. import org.slf4j.Logger;import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\n...\nLogger logger_parent = LoggerFactory.getLogger(\"parent\");Logger logger_child = LoggerFactory.getLogger(\"parent.child\");  A logger inherits the properties of its ancestor logger and can define its own. You can think of this as similar to class inheritance in Java. The MongoDB Java driver defines the following logger names to organize different logging events in the driver. Here are the logger names defined in the driver and the logging events they correspond to.  * org.mongodb.driver.authenticator : authentication  * org.mongodb.driver.client : events related to

Document\n * Remove an Index Using a Name Field\n * Remove an Index Using a Wildcard Character \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use indexes with the MongoDB Java driver. Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Without indexes, MongoDB must scan every document in a collection (a collection scan) to find the documents that match each query. These collection scans are slow and can negatively affect the performance of your application. If an appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB can use the index to limit the number of documents it must inspect. Indexes also:      * Allow efficient sorting  * Enable special capabilities like geospatial search  * Allow adding constraints to ensure a field value is unique  * And more \nTIP Indexes are also used by update operations when finding the documents to update, delete operations when finding the documents to delete, and by certain stages in the aggregation pipeline. \nQUERY COVERAGE AND PERFORMANCE \nWhen you execute a query against MongoDB, your command can include various elements:  * Query criteria that specify fields and values you are looking for  * Options that affect the query's execution (e.g. read concern)  * Projection criteria to specify the fields MongoDB should return (optional)  * Sort criteria to specify the order documents will be returned from MongoDB (optional) When all the fields specified in the query, projection, and sort are in the same index, MongoDB returns results directly from the index, also called a covered query. \nIMPORTANT \nSORT ORDER Sort criteria must match or invert the order of the index. Consider an index on the field name in ascending order (A-Z) and age in descending order (9-0): name_1_age_-1 MongoDB would use this index when you sort your data by either:  * name ascending, age descending  * name descending, age ascending Specifying a sort order of name and age ascending or name and age descending would require an in-memory sort. For additional information on how to ensure your index covers your query criteria and projection, see the MongoDB manual articles on query coverage. \nOPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS \nTo improve query performance, build indexes on fields that appear often in your application's queries and operations that return sorted results. Each index that you add consumes disk space and memory when active so you should track index memory and disk usage for capacity planning. In addition, when a write operation updates an indexed field, MongoDB also has to update the related index. Since MongoDB supports dynamic schemas, applications can query against fields whose names cannot be known in advance or are arbitrary. MongoDB 4.2 introduced wildcard indexes to help support these queries. Wildcard indexes are not designed to replace workload-based index planning. For more information on designing your data model and choosing indexes appropriate for your application, see the MongoDB server documentation on Indexing Strategies and Data Modeling and Indexes. \nINDEX TYPES \nMongoDB supports a number of different index types to support querying your data. The following sections describe the most common index types and provide sample code for creating each index type. For a full list of index types, see Indexes. \nTIP The MongoDB Java Driver provides the Indexes class that includes static factory methods to create index specification documents for different MongoDB Index key types. The following examples use the createIndex() method to create various indexes, and the following setup: import com.mongodb.DuplicateKeyException;import com.mongodb.MongoCommandException;import com.mongodb.client.*;import com.mongodb.client.model.IndexOptions;import com.mongodb.client.model.Indexes;import com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts;import com.mongodb.client.model.geojson.Point;import

 \nSINGLE FIELD AND COMPOUND INDEXES \nSINGLE FIELD INDEXES \nSingle field indexes are indexes with a reference to a single field within a collection's documents. They improve single field query and sort performance, and support TTL Indexes that automatically remove documents from a collection after a certain amount of time or at a specific clock time. \nNOTE The _id_ index is an example of a single field index. This index is automatically created on the _id field when a new collection is created. The following example creates an index in ascending order on the title field: String resultCreateIndex = collection.createIndex(Indexes.ascending(\"title\"));System.out.println(String.format(\"Index created: %s\", resultCreateIndex));  The following is an example of a query that would be covered by the index created in the preceding code snippet: Bson filter = eq(\"title\", \"Batman\");Bson sort = Sorts.ascending(\"title\");Bson projection = fields(include(\"title\"), excludeId());FindIterable<Document> cursor = collection.find(filter).sort(sort).projection(projection);  See the MongoDB server manual section on single field indexes for more information. COMPOUND INDEXES \nCompound indexes hold references to multiple fields within a collection's documents, improving query and sort performance. \nTIP Read more about compound indexes, index prefixes, and sort order here. The following example creates a compound index on the type and rated fields: String resultCreateIndex = collection.createIndex(Indexes.ascending(\"type\", \"rated\"));System.out.println(String.format(\"Index created: %s\", resultCreateIndex));  The following is an example of a query that would be covered by the index created in the preceding code snippet: Bson filter = and(eq(\"type\", \"movie\"), eq(\"rated\", \"G\"));Bson sort = Sorts.ascending(\"type\", \"rated\");Bson projection = fields(include(\"type\", \"rated\"), excludeId());FindIterable<Document> cursor = collection.find(filter).sort(sort).projection(projection);  See the MongoDB server manual section on Compound indexes for more information. \nMULTIKEY INDEXES (INDEXES ON ARRAY FIELDS) \nMultikey indexes are indexes that improve performance for queries that specify a field with an index that contains an array value. You can define a multikey index using the same syntax as a single field or compound index. The following example creates a compound, multikey index on the rated, genres (an array of Strings), and title fields: String resultCreateIndex = collection.createIndex(Indexes.ascending(\"rated\", \"genres\", \"title\"));System.out.println(String.format(\"Index created: %s\", resultCreateIndex));  The following is an example of a query that would be covered by the index created in the preceding code snippet: Bson filter = and(eq(\"genres\", \"Animation\"), eq(\"rated\", \"G\"));Bson sort = Sorts.ascending(\"title\");Bson projection = fields(include(\"title\", \"rated\"), excludeId());FindIterable<Document> cursor = collection.find(filter).sort(sort).projection(projection);  Multikey indexes behave differently from non-multikey indexes in terms of query coverage, index bound computation, and sort behavior. For a full explanation of multikey indexes, including a discussion of their behavior and limitations, refer to the Multikey Indexes page in the MongoDB manual. \nTEXT INDEXES \nText indexes support text search queries on string content. These indexes can include any field whose value is a string or an array of string elements. MongoDB supports text search for various languages. You can specify the default language as an option when creating the index. \nTIP Text indexes differ from the more powerful Atlas full text search indexes. Atlas users should use Atlas search. SINGLE FIELD \nThe following example creates a text index on the plot field: // create a text index of the \"plot\" field in the \"movies\" collection// if a text index already exists with a different configuration, this will// errortry {    String resultCreateIndex = collection.createIndex(Indexes.text(\"plot\"));    System.out.println(String.format(\"Index created: %s\", resultCreateIndex));}

\nA collection can only contain one text index. If you want to create a text index for multiple text fields, you need to create a compound index. A text search runs on all the text fields within the compound index. The following snippet creates a compound text index for the title and genre fields: collection.createIndex(Indexes.compoundIndex(Indexes.text(\"title\"), Indexes.text(\"genre\")));  For more information, see the following Server Manual Entries:  * Compound Text Index Restrictions  * Text Indexes \nGEOSPATIAL INDEXES \nMongoDB supports queries of geospatial coordinate data using 2dsphere indexes. With a 2dsphere index, you can query the geospatial data for inclusion, intersection, and proximity. For more information on querying geospatial data, see Geospatial Queries. To create a 2dsphere index, you must specify a field that contains only GeoJSON objects. For more details on this type, see the MongoDB server manual page on GeoJSON objects. The location.geo field in the following sample document from the theaters collection in the sample_mflix database is a GeoJSON Point object that describes the coordinates of the theater: {   \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"59a47286cfa9a3a73e51e75c\"),   \"theaterId\" : 104,   \"location\" : {      \"address\" : {         \"street1\" : \"5000 W 147th St\",         \"city\" : \"Hawthorne\",         \"state\" : \"CA\",         \"zipcode\" : \"90250\"      },      \"geo\" : {         \"type\" : \"Point\",         \"coordinates\" : [            -118.36559,            33.897167         ]      }   }}  The following example creates a 2dsphere index on the location.geo field: \nIMPORTANT Attempting to create a geospatial index on a field that is covered by a geospatial index will result in an error. // if an existing geo index exists, this will errortry {    String resultCreateIndex = collection.createIndex(Indexes.geo2dsphere(\"location.geo\"));    System.out.println(String.format(\"Index created: %s\", resultCreateIndex));} catch (MongoCommandException e) {    if (e.getErrorCodeName().equals(\"IndexOptionsConflict\"))        System.out.println(\"there's an existing text index with different options\");}  The following is an example of a geospatial query using the \"location.geo\" index. // MongoDB Headquarters in NY, NY.Point refPoint = new Point(new Position(-73.98456, 40.7612));Bson filter = near(\"location.geo\", refPoint, 1000.0, 0.0);FindIterable<Document> cursor = collection.find(filter);  MongoDB also supports 2d indexes for calculating distances on a Euclidean plane and for working with the \"legacy coordinate pairs\" syntax used in MongoDB 2.2 and earlier. See the Geospatial Queries page in the MongoDB server manual for more information. \nUNIQUE INDEXES \nUnique indexes ensure that the indexed fields do not store duplicate values. By default, MongoDB creates a unique index on the _id field during the creation of a collection. To create a unique index, specify the field or combination of fields that you want to prevent duplication on and set the unique option to true.

\nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to authenticate with MongoDB using each authentication mechanism available exclusively in the MongoDB Enterprise Edition. You can use the following mechanisms with the latest version of MongoDB Enterprise Edition:      * Kerberos (GSSAPI)  * LDAP (PLAIN) To authenticate using another mechanism, see the Authentication Mechanisms guide. For more information on establishing a connection to your MongoDB cluster, read our Connection Guide. \nSPECIFY AN AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM \nYou can specify your authentication mechanism and credentials when connecting to MongoDB using either of the following:  * A connection string  * A MongoCredential factory method A connection string (also known as a connection uri) specifies how to connect and authenticate to your MongoDB cluster. To authenticate using a connection string, include your settings in your connection string and pass it to the MongoClients.create() method to instantiate your MongoClient. Select the Connection String tab to see the syntax for authenticating using a connection string. Alternatively, you can use the MongoCredential class to specify your authentication details. The MongoCredential class contains static factory methods that construct instances containing your authentication mechanism and credentials. When you use the MongoCredential helper class, you need to use the MongoClientSettings.Builder class to configure your connection settings when constructing your MongoClient. Select the MongoCredential tab to see the syntax for authenticating using a MongoCredential. For more information on these classes and methods, refer to the following API documentation:  * MongoClients.create()  * MongoClient  * MongoClientSettings.Builder  * MongoCredential \nMECHANISMS  KERBEROS (GSSAPI) \nThe Generic Security Services API (GSSAPI) authentication mechanism allows the user to authenticate to a Kerberos service using the user's principal name. \nNOTE The method refers to the GSSAPI authentication mechanism instead of Kerberos because the driver authenticates using the GSSAPI RFC-4652 SASL mechanism. The following code snippets show how to specify the authentication mechanism, using the following placeholders:  * username - your URL-encoded principal name, e.g. \"username%40REALM.ME\"  * hostname - network address of your MongoDB server, accessible by your client  * port - port number of your MongoDB server Select the Connection String or the MongoCredential tab below for instructions and sample code for specifying this authentication mechanism:  \nIn order to acquire a Kerberos ticket, the GSSAPI Java libraries require you to specify the realm and Key Distribution Center (KDC) system properties. See the sample settings in the following example: java.security.krb5.realm=MYREALM.MEjava.security.krb5.kdc=mykdc.myrealm.me  You may need to specify one or more of the following additional MongoCredential mechanism properties depending on your Kerberos setup:  * SERVICE_NAME  * CANONICALIZE_HOST_NAME  * JAVA_SUBJECT  * JAVA_SASL_CLIENT_PROPERTIES  * JAVA_SUBJECT_PROVIDER  \nBy default, the Java driver caches Kerberos tickets by MongoClient instance. If your deployment needs to frequently create and destroy MongoClient instances, you can change the default Kerberos ticket caching behavior to cache by process to improve performance.   NOTE On Windows, Oracle’s JRE uses LSA rather than SSPI in its implementation of GSSAPI which limits interoperability with Windows Active Directory and implementations of single sign-on. See the following articles for more information:  * JDK-8054026  * JDK-6722928  * SO 23427343 \nLDAP (PLAIN) \nAvailable in MongoDB Enterprise Edition 3.4 and later. You can authenticate to a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server using your directory server username and password. \nTIP The authentication mechanism is named PLAIN instead of LDAP since it authenticates using the PLAIN Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) defined in RFC-4616. You can specify this authentication mechanism by setting the authMechanism parameter to PLAIN and including your LDAP username and password in the connection string.

GridFS is a specification implemented by the driver that describes how to split files into chunks when storing them and reassemble them when retrieving them. The driver implementation of GridFS is an abstraction that manages the operations and organization of the file storage. You should use GridFS if the size of your files exceed the BSON document size limit of 16MB. For more detailed information on whether GridFS is suitable for your use case, see the GridFS server manual page. See the following sections that describe GridFS operations and how to perform them:      * Create a GridFS bucket  * Store Files  * Retrieve File Information  * Download Files  * Rename Files  * Delete Files  * Delete a GridFS bucket \nHOW GRIDFS WORKS \nGridFS organizes files in a bucket, a group of MongoDB collections that contain the chunks of files and information describing them. The bucket contains the following collections, named using the convention defined in the GridFS specification:  * The chunks collection stores the binary file chunks.  * The files collection stores the file metadata. When you create a new GridFS bucket, the driver creates the preceding collections, prefixed with the default bucket name fs, unless you specify a different name. The driver also creates an index on each collection to ensure efficient retrieval of the files and related metadata. The driver only creates the GridFS bucket on the first write operation if it does not already exist. The driver only creates indexes if they do not exist and when the bucket is empty. For more information on GridFS indexes, see the server manual page on GridFS Indexes. When storing files with GridFS, the driver splits the files into smaller chunks, each represented by a separate document in the chunks collection. It also creates a document in the files collection that contains a file id, file name, and other file metadata. You can upload the file from memory or from a stream. See the following diagram to see how GridFS splits the files when uploaded to a bucket.  When retrieving files, GridFS fetches the metadata from the files collection in the specified bucket and uses the information to reconstruct the file from documents in the chunks collection. You can read the file into memory or output it to a stream. \nCREATE A GRIDFS BUCKET \nTo store or retrieve files from GridFS, create a bucket or get a reference to an existing one on a MongoDB database. Call the GridFSBuckets.create() helper method with a MongoDatabase instance as the parameter to instantiate a GridFSBucket. You can use the GridFSBucket instance to call read and write operations on the files in your bucket. MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase(\"mydb\");GridFSBucket gridFSBucket = GridFSBuckets.create(database);  To create or reference a bucket with a custom name other than the default name fs, pass your bucket name as the second parameter to the create() method as shown below: GridFSBucket gridFSBucket = GridFSBuckets.create(database, \"myCustomBucket\");  \nNOTE When you call create(), MongoDB does not create the bucket if it does not exist. Instead, MongoDB creates the bucket as necessary such as when you upload your first file. For more information on the classes and methods mentioned in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * GridFSBuckets  * GridFSBucket \nSTORE FILES \nTo store a file in a GridFS bucket, you can either upload it from an instance of InputStream or write its data to a GridFSUploadStream. For either upload process, you can specify configuration information such as file chunk size and other field/value pairs to store as metadata. Set this information on an instance of GridFSUploadOptions as shown in the following code snippet: GridFSUploadOptions options = new GridFSUploadOptions()        .chunkSizeBytes(1048576) // 1MB chunk

For more information, see the API Documentation on uploadFromStream(). \nUPLOAD A FILE USING AN OUTPUT STREAM \nThis section shows you how to upload a file to a GridFS bucket by writing to an output stream. The following code example shows how you can write to a GridFSUploadStream to send data to GridFS by performing the following operations:  * Read a file named \"project.zip\" from the filesystem into a byte array.  * Set the chunk size using GridFSUploadOptions.  * Set a custom metadata field called type to the value \"zip archive\".  * Write the bytes to a GridFSUploadStream, assigning the file name \"myProject.zip\". The stream reads data into a buffer until it reaches the limit specified in the chunkSize setting, and inserts it as a new chunk in the chunks collection. Path filePath = Paths.get(\"/path/to/project.zip\");byte[] data = Files.readAllBytes(filePath);\nGridFSUploadOptions options = new GridFSUploadOptions()        .chunkSizeBytes(1048576)        .metadata(new Document(\"type\", \"zip archive\"));\ntry (GridFSUploadStream uploadStream = gridFSBucket.openUploadStream(\"myProject.zip\", options)) {    uploadStream.write(data);    uploadStream.flush();    System.out.println(\"The file id of the uploaded file is: \" + uploadStream.getObjectId().toHexString());} catch (Exception e) {    System.err.println(\"The file upload failed: \" + e);}  This code example prints the file id of the uploaded file after it is successfully saved in GridFS. \nNOTE If your file upload is not successful, the operation throws an exception and any uploaded chunks become orphaned chunks. An orphaned chunk is a document in a GridFS chunks collection that does not reference any file id in the GridFS files collection. File chunks can become orphaned chunks when an upload or delete operation is interrupted. To remove orphaned chunks, you must identify them using read operations and remove them using write operations. For more information, see the API Documentation on GridFSUploadStream. \nRETRIEVE FILE INFORMATION \nIn this section, you can learn how to retrieve file metadata stored in the files collection of the GridFS bucket. The metadata contains information about the file it refers to, including:  * The id of the file  * The name of the file  * The length/size of the file  * The upload date and time  * A metadata document in which you can store any other information To retrieve files from a GridFS bucket, call the find() method on the GridFSBucket instance. The method returns a GridFSFindIterable from which you can access the results. The following code example shows you how to retrieve and print file metadata from all your files in a GridFS bucket. Among the different ways that you can traverse the retrieved results from the GridFSFindIterable, the example uses a Consumer functional interface to print the following results: gridFSBucket.find().forEach(new Consumer<GridFSFile>() {    @Override    public void accept(final GridFSFile gridFSFile) {        System.out.println(gridFSFile);    }});  The next code example shows you how to retrieve and print the file names for all files that match the fields specified in the query filter.

 Since metadata is an embedded document, the query filter specifies the type field within the document using dot notation. See the server manual guide on how to Query on Embedded/Nested Documents for more information. For more information on the classes and methods mentioned in this section, see the following resources:  * GridFSFindIterable API Documentation  * GridFSBucket.find() API Documentation  * Sort Results  * Limit the Number of Returned Results \nDOWNLOAD FILES \nYou can download a file from GridFS directly to a stream or you can save it to memory from a stream. You can specify the file to retrieve using either the file id or file name. \nFILE REVISIONS \nWhen your bucket contains multiple files that share the same file name, GridFS chooses the latest uploaded version of the file by default. To differentiate between each file that shares the same name, GridFS assigns files that share the same filename a revision number, ordered by upload time. The original file revision number is \"0\" and the next most recent file revision number is \"1\". You can also specify negative values which correspond to the recency of the revision. The revision value \"-1\" references the most recent revision and \"-2\" references the next most recent revision. The following code snippet shows how you can specify the second revision of a file in an instance of GridFSDownloadOptions: GridFSDownloadOptions downloadOptions = new GridFSDownloadOptions().revision(1);  For more information on the enumeration of revisions, see the API documentation for GridFSDownloadOptions. \nDOWNLOAD A FILE TO AN OUTPUT STREAM \nYou can download a file in a GridFS bucket to an output stream. The following code example shows you how you can call the downloadToStream() method to download the first revision of the file named \"myProject.zip\" to an OutputStream. GridFSDownloadOptions downloadOptions = new GridFSDownloadOptions().revision(0);\ntry (FileOutputStream streamToDownloadTo = new FileOutputStream(\"/tmp/myProject.zip\")) {    gridFSBucket.downloadToStream(\"myProject.zip\", streamToDownloadTo, downloadOptions);    streamToDownloadTo.flush();}  For more information on this method, see the downloadToStream() API Documentation. \nDOWNLOAD A FILE TO AN INPUT STREAM \nYou can download a file in a GridFS bucket to memory by using an input stream. You can call the openDownloadStream() method on the GridFS bucket to open a GridFSDownloadStream, an input stream from which you can read the file. The following code example shows you how to download a file referenced by the fileId variable into memory and print its contents as a string: ObjectId fileId = new ObjectId(\"60345d38ebfcf47030e81cc9\");try (GridFSDownloadStream downloadStream = gridFSBucket.openDownloadStream(fileId)) {    int fileLength = (int) downloadStream.getGridFSFile().getLength();    byte[] bytesToWriteTo = new byte[fileLength];    downloadStream.read(bytesToWriteTo);    System.out.println(new String(bytesToWriteTo, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));}  For more information on this method, see the openDownloadStream(). API Documentation. \nRENAME FILES \nYou can update the name of a GridFS file in your bucket by calling the rename() method. You must specify the file to rename by its file id rather than its file name. \nNOTE The rename() method only supports updating the name of one file at a time. To rename multiple files, retrieve a list of files matching the file name from the bucket, extract the file id values from the files you want to rename, and pass each file id in separate calls to the rename() method. The following code example shows you how to update the name of the file referenced by the fileId variable to \"mongodbTutorial.zip\": ObjectId fileId = new ObjectId(\"60345d38ebfcf47030e81cc9\");gridFSBucket.rename(fileId, \"mongodbTutorial.zip\");  For more information on this method, see the rename() API Documentation. \nDELETE FILES \nYou can remove a file from your GridFS bucket by calling the delete() method. You must specify the file by its file id rather than its file name. \nNOTE The delete() method only supports deleting one file at a time.

Collections\n * Drop a Collection\n * Specify Read Preferences, Read Concerns, and Write Concerns \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use MongoDB databases and collections with the MongoDB Java driver. MongoDB organizes data into a hierachy of the following levels:      * Databases  * Collections  * Documents Databases are the top level of data organization in a MongoDB instance. Databases are organized into collections which contain documents. Documents contain literal data such as strings, numbers, and dates as well as other (embedded) documents. For more information on document field types and structure, see the server documentation for documents. \nACCESS A DATABASE \nUse the getDatabase() method of a MongoClient instance to access a MongoDatabase in a MongoDB instance. The following example accesses a database named \"testDatabase\": MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase(\"testDatabase\");  \nACCESS A COLLECTION \nUse the getCollection() method of a MongoDatabase instance to access a MongoCollection in a database of your connected MongoDB instance. The following example accesses a collection named \"testCollection\" from a MongoDatabase: MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase(\"testDatabase\");MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection(\"testCollection\");  \nTIP If the provided collection name does not already exist in the database, MongoDB implicitly creates the collection when you first insert data into that collection. \nCREATE A COLLECTION \nUse the createCollection() method of a MongoDatabase instance to create a collection in a database of your connected MongoDB instance. The following example creates a collection called \"exampleCollection\": database.createCollection(\"exampleCollection\");  You can specify collection options like maximum size and document validation rules using the CreateCollectionOptions class. The createCollection() method accepts an instance of CreateCollectionOptions as an optional second parameter. \nDOCUMENT VALIDATION \nDocument validation provides the ability to validate documents against a series of filters during writes to a collection. You can specify these filters using the ValidationOptions class, which accepts a series of Filters that specifies the validation rules and expressions: ValidationOptions collOptions = new ValidationOptions().validator(    Filters.or(Filters.exists(\"commander\"), Filters.exists(\"first officer\")));database.createCollection(\"ships\",    new CreateCollectionOptions().validationOptions(collOptions));  For more information, see the server documentation for document validation. \nGET A LIST OF COLLECTIONS \nYou can query for a list of collections in a database using the MongoDatabase.listCollectionNames() method: for (String name : database.listCollectionNames()) {    System.out.println(name);}  \nDROP A COLLECTION \nYou can remove a collection from the database using the MongoCollection.drop() method: MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection(\"bass\");collection.drop();  \nWARNING \nDROPPING A COLLECTION DELETES ALL DATA IN THE COLLECTION Dropping a collection from your database also permanently deletes all documents within that collection and all indexes on that collection. Only drop collections that contain data that is no longer needed. \nSPECIFY READ PREFERENCES, READ CONCERNS, AND WRITE CONCERNS \nRead preferences, read concerns, and write concerns control how the driver routes read operations and waits for acknowledgment for read and write operations when connected to a MongoDB replica set. Read preferences and read concerns apply to all read operations; write concerns apply to all write operations. MongoDatabase instances inherit their write concern, read concern, and write preference settings from the MongoClient used to create them. MongoCollection instances inherit their write concern, read concern, and write preference settings from the MongoDatabase used to create them. However, you can use the following methods to obtain an instance of a MongoDatabase or MongoCollection with a read preference, read concern, or write concern that differs from the setting they would normally inherit:  * MongoDatabase.withReadConcern()  * MongoDatabase.withReadPreference()  * MongoDatabase.withWriteConcern()  * MongoCollection.withReadConcern()  *

Docs Home → Java Sync \nSTABLE API \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Enable the Stable API on a MongoDB Client\n * Stable API Options \nNOTE The Stable API feature requires MongoDB Server 5.0 or later. You should only use the Stable API feature if all the MongoDB servers you are connecting to support this feature. \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to specify the Stable API when connecting to a MongoDB instance or replica set. You can use the Stable API feature to force the server to run operations with behavior compatible with the specified API version. An API version defines the expected behavior of the operations it covers and the format of server responses. If you change to a different API version, the operations are not guaranteed to be compatible and the server responses are not guaranteed to be similar. When you use the Stable API feature with an official MongoDB driver, you can update your driver or server without worrying about backward compatibility issues of the commands covered by the Stable API. See the MongoDB reference page on the Stable API for more information including a list of commands it covers. The following sections describe how you can enable the Stable API for your MongoDB client and the options that you can specify. \nENABLE THE STABLE API ON A MONGODB CLIENT \nTo enable the Stable API, you must specify an API version in the settings of your MongoDB client. Once you instantiate a MongoClient instance with a specified API version, all commands you run with that client use that version of the Stable API. \nTIP If you need to run commands using more than one version of the Stable API, instantiate a separate client with that version. If you need to run commands not covered by the Stable API, make sure the \"strict\" option is disabled. See the section on Stable API Options for more information. The following example shows how you can instantiate a MongoClient that sets the Stable API version and connects to a server by performing the following operations:      * Construct a ServerApi instance using the ServerApi.Builder helper class.  * Specify a Stable API version using a constant from the ServerApiVersion class.  * Construct a MongoClientSettings instance using the MongoClientSettings.Builder class.  * Specify a server to connect to using a ServerAddress instance.  * Instantiate a MongoClient using the MongoClients.create() method and pass your MongoClientSettings instance as a parameter. ServerApi serverApi = ServerApi.builder()        .version(ServerApiVersion.V1)        .build();\n// Replace the uri string with your MongoDB deployment's connection stringString uri = \"<connection string uri>\";\nMongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()        .applyConnectionString(new ConnectionString(uri))        .serverApi(serverApi)        .build();\nMongoClient client = MongoClients.create(settings);  \nWARNING If you specify an API version and connect to a MongoDB server that does not support the Stable API, your application may raise an exception when executing a command on your MongoDB server. If you use a MongoClient that specifies the API version to query a server that does not support it, your query could fail with an exception message that includes the following text: 'Unrecognized field 'apiVersion' on server... For more information on the methods and classes referenced in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * ServerApi  * ServerApi.Builder  * ServerApiVersion  * ServerAddress  * MongoClientSettings  * MongoClientSettings.Builder  * MongoClients.create()  * MongoClient \nSTABLE API OPTIONS \nYou can enable or disable optional behavior related to the Stable API as described in the following table. Option Name\nDescription\nStrict\nOptional. When set, if you call a command that is not part of the declared API version, the driver raises an exception. \nDefault: false\nDeprecationErrors\nOptional. When set, if you call a command that is deprecated in the declared API version, the driver raises an exception. \nDefault: false The following example shows how you can set the two options on an

Decryption\n * Explicit Encryption and Decryption\n * Explicit Encryption and Auto Decryption \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to install and use Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) in the MongoDB Java driver. CSFLE allows you to encrypt specific data fields within a document with your MongoDB client application before sending the data to the server. Starting in MongoDB 4.2 Enterprise, you can perform this client-side encryption automatically. With CSFLE, your client application encrypts fields client-side without requiring any server-side configuration or directives. CSFLE is useful for situations in which applications must guarantee that unauthorized parties, including server administrators, cannot read the encrypted data. This guide is a quick introduction to CSFLE using the Java driver. For in-depth information on how CSFLE works, see the CSFLE reference documentation. For a real-world scenario and implementation, see our CSFLE Guide. \nINSTALLATION \nTo get started with CSFLE in your client application, you need      * the MongoDB Java driver  * mongodb-crypt  * mongocryptd if using automatic encryption (Enterprise or Atlas) \nMONGODB-CRYPT \nThe mongodb-crypt binding is available as a separate JAR. Add it to your project using your desired dependency management tool.   MONGOCRYPTD \nmongocryptd is a binary run as a daemon / process that is used for automatic encryption. mongodb-crypt communicates with mongocryptd to automatically encrypt the information specified by a user-provided JSON Schema. For more detailed information on mongocryptd, see the mongocryptd reference documentation \nEXAMPLES \nThe examples on this page use a local key, but you can also use integrated support for cloud-based key management services from AWS, Azure, and GCP. Each example program execution creates a new master key in memory and drops the test.coll collection. \nTIP In the examples, the in-memory master key is lost when the application finishes running. If you'd like to retain and decrypt documents from previous runs, you can save the local master key to a file for reuse and remove the logic to drop the collection. \nWARNING MongoDB recommends using local key management only for testing purposes, and using a remote key management service for production. \nAUTOMATIC ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION \nThe following example shows how to configure the AutoEncryptionSettings instance to create a new key and set the JSON schema map. The data in the encryptedField field is automatically encrypted before insertion, and decrypted when calling find() on the client side. Querying this collection from a client that isn't configured for CSFLE will return the document in encrypted form.

 \nEXPLICIT ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION \nThe prior example demonstrated the automatic CSFLE feature. If your version of MongoDB does not offer automatic CSFLE, you can perform manual client-side field level encryption, which we call explicit encryption. This method does not require or use mongocryptd. The ClientEncryption class contains methods you can use to perform explicit encryption. This example prints out the document in encrypted form, and prints out the explicitly decrypted field value to demonstrate functionality. The full source is available from ClientSideEncryptionExplicitEncryptionAndDecryptionTour.java // This would have to be the same master key as was used to create the encryption keyfinal byte[] localMasterKey = new byte[96];new SecureRandom().nextBytes(localMasterKey);\nMap<String, Map<String, Object>> kmsProviders = new HashMap<String, Map<String, Object>>() {{    put(\"local\", new HashMap<String, Object>() {{        put(\"key\", localMasterKey);    }});}};\nMongoClientSettings clientSettings = MongoClientSettings.builder().build();MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(clientSettings);\n// Set up the key vault for this exampleMongoNamespace keyVaultNamespace = new MongoNamespace(\"encryption.testKeyVault\");MongoCollection<Document> keyVaultCollection = mongoClient    .getDatabase(keyVaultNamespace.getDatabaseName())    .getCollection(keyVaultNamespace.getCollectionName());keyVaultCollection.drop();\n// Ensure that two data keys cannot share the same keyAltName.keyVaultCollection.createIndex(Indexes.ascending(\"keyAltNames\"),        new IndexOptions().unique(true)           .partialFilterExpression(Filters.exists(\"keyAltNames\")));\nMongoCollection<Document> collection = mongoClient.getDatabase(\"test\").getCollection(\"coll\");collection.drop(); // Clear old data\n// Create the ClientEncryption instanceClientEncryptionSettings clientEncryptionSettings = ClientEncryptionSettings.builder()        .keyVaultMongoClientSettings(MongoClientSettings.builder()                .applyConnectionString(new ConnectionString(\"mongodb://localhost\"))                .build())        .keyVaultNamespace(keyVaultNamespace.getFullName())        .kmsProviders(kmsProviders)        .build();\nClientEncryption clientEncryption = ClientEncryptions.create(clientEncryptionSettings);\nBsonBinary dataKeyId = clientEncryption.createDataKey(\"local\", new DataKeyOptions());\n// Explicitly encrypt a fieldBsonBinary encryptedFieldValue = clientEncryption.encrypt(new BsonString(\"123456789\"),        new EncryptOptions(\"AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic\").keyId(dataKeyId));\ncollection.insertOne(new Document(\"encryptedField\", encryptedFieldValue));\nDocument doc = collection.find().first();System.out.println(doc.toJson());\n// Explicitly decrypt the fieldSystem.out.println(    clientEncryption.decrypt(new BsonBinary(doc.get(\"encryptedField\", Binary.class).getData())));  \nEXPLICIT ENCRYPTION AND AUTO DECRYPTION \nAlthough automatic encryption requires MongoDB Enterprise or MongoDB Atlas, automatic decryption is available in all MongoDB versions greater than or equal to 4.2. To configure automatic decryption, set bypassAutoEncryption(true) in the autoEncryptionSettings builder. The following example prints the inserted document out in unencrypted form. The document is automatically decrypted because autoEncryptionSettings have been configured.

Example\n * Explain Aggregation Example\n * Aggregation Expression Example \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use aggregation operations in the MongoDB Java driver. Aggregation operations process data in your MongoDB collections and return computed results. MongoDB's Aggregation pipeline, part of the Query API, is modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-staged pipeline that transforms the documents into an aggregated result. Another way to think of aggregation is like a car factory. Within the car factory is an assembly line, along which are assembly stations with specialized tools to do a specific job, like drills and welders. Raw parts enter the factory, which are then transformed and assembled into a finished product. The aggregation pipeline is the assembly line, aggregation stages are the assembly stations, and operator expressions are the specialized tools. \nAGGREGATION AND FIND OPERATIONS COMPARED \nUsing find operations, you can:      * select what documents to return  * select what fields to return  * sort the results Using aggregation operations, you can:  * perform all find operations  * rename fields  * calculate fields  * summarize data  * group values Aggregation operations have some limitations you must keep in mind:  * Returned documents must not violate the BSON document size limit of 16 megabytes.  * Pipeline stages have a memory limit of 100 megabytes by default. If required, you may exceed this limit by using the allowDiskUse method.\n   \n   \n   IMPORTANT\n   \n   \n   $GRAPHLOOKUP EXCEPTION\n   \n   The $graphLookup stage has a strict memory limit of 100 megabytes and will ignore allowDiskUse. \nUSEFUL REFERENCES \n * Aggregation pipeline  * Aggregation stages  * Operator expressions  * Aggregation Builders \nRUNNABLE EXAMPLES  BASE SETUP \nCreate a

 \nBASIC AGGREGATION EXAMPLE \nTo perform an aggregation, pass a list of aggregation stages to the MongoCollection.aggregate() method. The Java driver provides the Aggregates helper class that contains builders for aggregation stages. In the following example, the aggregation pipeline:  * Uses a $match stage to filter for documents whose categories array field contains the element Bakery. The example uses Aggregates.match to build the $match stage.  * Uses a $group stage to group the matching documents by the stars field, accumulating a count of documents for each distinct value of stars. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: You can build the expressions used in this example using the aggregation builders. collection.aggregate(    Arrays.asList(        Aggregates.match(Filters.eq(\"categories\", \"Bakery\")),        Aggregates.group(\"$stars\", Accumulators.sum(\"count\", 1))    )).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));  The preceding aggregation should produce the following results: {\"_id\": 4, \"count\": 2}{\"_id\": 5, \"count\": 1} For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * MongoCollection.aggregate()  * Aggregates.match \nEXPLAIN AGGREGATION EXAMPLE \nTo view information about how MongoDB executes your operation, use the explain() method of the AggregateIterable class. The explain() method returns execution plans and performance statistics. An execution plan is a potential way MongoDB can complete an operation. The explain() method provides both the winning plan (the plan MongoDB executed) and rejected plans. You can specify the level of detail of your explanation by passing a verbosity level to the explain() method. The following table shows all verbosity levels for explanations and their intended use cases: Verbosity Level\nUse Case\nALL_PLANS_EXECUTIONS\nYou want to know which plan MongoDB will choose to run your query.\nEXECUTION_STATS\nYou want to know if your query is performing well.\nQUERY_PLANNER\nYou have a problem with your query and you want as much information as possible to diagnose the issue. In the following example, we print the JSON representation of the winning plans for aggregation stages that produce execution plans: Document explanation = collection.aggregate(    Arrays.asList(            Aggregates.match(Filters.eq(\"categories\", \"bakery\")),            Aggregates.group(\"$stars\", Accumulators.sum(\"count\", 1))    )).explain(ExplainVerbosity.EXECUTION_STATS);\nList<Document> stages = explanation.get(\"stages\", List.class);List<String> keys = Arrays.asList(\"queryPlanner\", \"winningPlan\");\nfor (Document stage : stages) {    Document cursorStage = stage.get(\"$cursor\", Document.class);    if (cursorStage != null) {        System.out.println(cursorStage.getEmbedded(keys, Document.class).toJson());    }}  The preceding code snippet should produce the following output: { \"stage\": \"PROJECTION_SIMPLE\",  \"transformBy\": {\"stars\": 1, \"_id\": 0},  \"inputStage\": {   \"stage\": \"COLLSCAN\",   \"filter\": {      \"categories\": {\"$eq\":\"bakery\"}},  \"direction\": \"forward\"}} For more information about the topics mentioned in this section, see the following resources:  * Explain Output Server Manual Entry  * Query Plans Server Manual Entry  * ExplainVerbosity API Documentation  * explain() API Documentation  * AggregateIterable API Documentation \nAGGREGATION EXPRESSION EXAMPLE \nThe Java driver provides builders for accumulator expressions for use with $group. You must declare all other expressions in JSON format or compatible document format. \nTIP The syntax in either of the following examples will define an $arrayElemAt expression. The $ in front of \"categories\" tells MongoDB that this is a field path, using the \"categories\" field from the input document. new Document(\"$arrayElemAt\", Arrays.asList(\"$categories\", 0))

MONGODB-CR\n * MONGODB-AWS\n * X.509 \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to authenticate with MongoDB using each authentication mechanism available in the MongoDB Community Edition. Authentication mechanisms are processes by which the driver and server confirm identity and establish trust to ensure security. The mechanisms that you can use with the latest version of MongoDB Community Edition are as follows:      * Default  * SCRAM-SHA-256  * SCRAM-SHA-1  * MONGODB-CR  * MONGODB-AWS  * X.509 To authenticate using Kerberos or LDAP, see the Enterprise Authentication Mechanisms guide. For more information on establishing a connection to your MongoDB cluster, read our Connection Guide. \nSPECIFY AN AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM \nYou can specify your authentication mechanism and credentials when connecting to MongoDB using either of the following:  * A connection string  * A MongoCredential factory method A connection string (also known as a connection uri) specifies how to connect and authenticate to your MongoDB cluster. To authenticate using a connection string, include your settings in your connection string and pass it to the MongoClients.create() method to instantiate your MongoClient. Select the Connection String tab to see the syntax for authenticating using a connection string. Alternatively, you can use the MongoCredential class to specify your authentication details. The MongoCredential class contains static factory methods that construct instances containing your authentication mechanism and credentials. When you use the MongoCredential helper class, you need to use the MongoClientSettings.Builder class to configure your connection settings when constructing your MongoClient. Select the MongoCredential tab to see the syntax for authenticating using a MongoCredential. For more information on these classes and methods, refer to the following API documentation:  * MongoClients.create()  * MongoClient  * MongoClientSettings.Builder  * MongoCredential \nMECHANISMS  DEFAULT \nThe default authentication mechanism setting uses one of the following authentication mechanisms depending on what your MongoDB server supports:  1. SCRAM-SHA-256  2. SCRAM-SHA-1  3. MONGODB-CR Server versions 3.6 and earlier use MONGODB-CR as the default mechanism. Newer versions of the server use one of the mechanisms for which they advertise support. The following code snippets show how to specify the authentication mechanism, using the following placeholders:  * username - your MongoDB username  * password - your MongoDB user's password  * hostname - network address of your MongoDB server, accessible by your client  * port - port number of your MongoDB server  * authenticationDb - MongoDB database that contains your user's authentication data. If you omit this parameter, the driver uses the default value admin. Select the Connection String or the MongoCredential tab below for instructions and sample code for specifying this authentication mechanism:  \nFor more information on the challenge-response (CR) and salted challenge-response authentication mechanisms (SCRAM) that MongoDB supports, see the SCRAM section of the server manual. \nSCRAM-SHA-256  NOTE SCRAM-SHA-256 is the default authentication method for MongoDB starting in MongoDB 4.0. SCRAM-SHA-256 is a salted challenge-response authentication mechanism (SCRAM) that uses your username and password, encrypted with the SHA-256 algorithm, to authenticate your user. The following code snippets show how to specify the authentication mechanism, using the following placeholders:  * username - your MongoDB username.  * password - your MongoDB user's password.  * hostname - network address of your MongoDB server, accessible by your client.  * port - port number of your MongoDB server.  * authenticationDb - MongoDB database that contains your user's authentication data. If you omit this parameter, the driver uses the default value admin. Select the Connection String or the MongoCredential tab below for instructions and sample code for specifying this authentication mechanism:   SCRAM-SHA-1  NOTE SCRAM-SHA-1 is the default authentication method for MongoDB versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6. SCRAM-SHA-1 is a salted challenge-response mechanism (SCRAM) that uses your username and password, encrypted with the SHA-1 algorithm, to authenticate your user.

 * password - your MongoDB user's password.  * hostname - network address of your MongoDB server, accessible by your client.  * port - port number of your MongoDB server.  * authenticationDb - MongoDB database that contains your user's authentication data. If you omit this parameter, the driver uses the default value admin. Select the Connection String or the MongoCredential tab below for instructions and sample code for specifying this authentication mechanism:   MONGODB-CR \nMONGODB-CR is a challenge-response authentication mechanism that uses your username and password to authenticate your user. This authentication mechanism was deprecated starting in MongoDB 3.6 and is no longer supported as of MongoDB 4.0. You cannot specify this method explicitly; refer to the fallback provided by the default authentication mechanism to connect using MONGODB-CR. \nMONGODB-AWS  NOTE The MONGODB-AWS authentication mechanism is available for MongoDB deployments on MongoDB Atlas. The MONGODB-AWS authentication mechanism uses your Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) credentials to authenticate your user. To learn more about configuring MongoDB Atlas, see the Set Up Passwordless Authentication with AWS IAM Roles guide. To instruct the driver to use this authentication mechanism, you can specify MONGODB-AWS either as a parameter in the connection string or by using the MongoCredential.createAwsCredential() factory method. Learn how to specify this authentication mechanism and the various ways to provide your AWS IAM credentials in the next sections. These sections contain code examples that use the following placeholders:  * awsKeyId - value of your AWS access key ID  * awsSecretKey - value of your AWS secret access key  * atlasUri - network address of your MongoDB Atlas deployment  * hostname - hostname of your MongoDB Atlas deployment  * port - port of your MongoDB Atlas deployment  * awsSessionToken - value of your AWS session token AWS SDK FOR JAVA \nNew in version v4.8. You can use one of the AWS SDK for Java v1 or v2 to specify your credentials. This method offers the following features:  * Multiple options for obtaining credentials  * Credential caching which helps your application avoid rate limiting  * Credential provider management for use with the Elastic Kubernetes Service. To use the AWS SDK for Java for MONGODB-AWS authentication, you must perform the following:  1. Specify the authentication mechanism  2. Add the SDK as a dependency to your project  3. Supply your credentials using one of the methods in the credential provider chain \nIMPORTANT This method of providing MONGODB-AWS credentials is available only in the MongoDB Java Driver v4.8 and later. To specify the authentication mechanism by using a MongoCredential, use the MongoCredential.createAwsCredential() factory method and add the MongoCredential instance to your MongoClient as shown in the following example: MongoCredential credential = MongoCredential.createAwsCredential(null, null);\nMongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(        MongoClientSettings.builder()        .applyToClusterSettings(builder ->        builder.hosts(Arrays.asList(new ServerAddress(\"<atlasUri>\"))))        .credential(credential)        .build());  To specify the authentication mechanism in the connection string, add it as a parameter as shown in the following example: MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(\"mongodb://<atlasUri>?authMechanism=MONGODB-AWS\");  To add the AWS SDK as a dependency to your project, see the following AWS documentation for the version you need:  * For the AWS SDK for Java v2, see the Setting Up guide.  * For the AWS SDK for Java v1, see the Getting Started guide. \nNOTE For the AWS SDK for Java v2, the Java driver currently tests using the software.amazon.awssdk:auth:2.18.9 dependency. For the AWS SDK for Java v1, the Java driver currently tests using the com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-core:1.12.337 dependency.

 * To learn more about the AWS SDK for Java v1 class the driver uses to get the credentials, see the DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain API documentation.\n   \n   Learn how to supply your credentials to this class from the Using the Default Credential Provider Chain section. \nNOTE If you include both v1 and v2 of the AWS SDK for Java in your project, you must use the v2 methods to supply your credentials. SPECIFY YOUR CREDENTIALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT \nYou can provide your AWS IAM credentials by instructing the driver to use the MONGODB-AWS authentication mechanism and by setting the appropriate environment variables. To use the environment variables to supply your credentials, you must perform the following:  1. Specify the authentication mechanism  2. Add the appropriate environment variables You can specify the authentication mechanism by using a MongoCredential or on the connection string. To specify the authentication mechanism by using a MongoCredential, use the MongoCredential.createAwsCredential() factory method and add the MongoCredential instance to your MongoClient as shown in the following example: MongoCredential credential = MongoCredential.createAwsCredential(null, null);\nMongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(        MongoClientSettings.builder()        .applyToClusterSettings(builder ->        builder.hosts(Arrays.asList(new ServerAddress(\"<atlasUri>\"))))        .credential(credential)        .build());  To specify the authentication mechanism in the connection string, add it as a parameter as shown in the following example: MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(\"mongodb://<atlasUri>?authMechanism=MONGODB-AWS\");  The next examples show how to provide your credentials by setting environment variables for the following types of authentication:  * Programmatic access keys  * ECS container credentials  * EC2 container credentials The following example shows how you can set your programmatic access keys in environment variables by using bash or a similar shell: export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<awsKeyId>export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<awsSecretKey>export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<awsSessionToken>  Omit the line containing AWS_SESSION_TOKEN if you don't need an AWS session token for that role. To authenticate by using ECS container credentials, set the ECS endpoint relative URI in an environment variable by using bash or a similar shell as shown in the following example: export AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI=<your ECS endpoint>  To authenticate using EC2 container credentials, make sure none of the aforementioned environment variables are set. The driver obtains the credentials from the default IPv4 EC2 instance metadata endpoint. SPECIFY YOUR CREDENTIALS IN A MONGOCREDENTIAL \nYou can supply your AWS IAM credentials to a MongoClient by using a MongoCredential instance. To construct the MongoCredential instance for MONGODB-AWS authentication, use the createAwsCredential() factory method. You can supply only programmatic access keys to the MongoCredential.createAwsCredential() method. If you need to supply ECS or EC2 container credentials, use the instructions in Specify Your Credentials in the Environment or AWS SDK for Java. To use the MongoCredential for MONGODB-AWS authentication, you must perform the following:  1. Specify the authentication mechanism  2. Supply the credentials To specify the authentication mechanism by using a MongoCredential, use the MongoCredential.createAwsCredential() factory method and add the MongoCredential instance to your MongoClient as shown in the following example: MongoCredential credential = MongoCredential.createAwsCredential(\"<awsKeyId>\", \"<awsSecretKey>\".toCharArray());\nMongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(        MongoClientSettings.builder()        .applyToClusterSettings(builder ->        builder.hosts(Arrays.asList(new ServerAddress(\"<atlasUri>\"))))

Support Collations\n * Collation Options\n * Collation Examples\n * find() and sort() Example\n * findOneAndUpdate() Example\n * findOneAndDelete() Example\n * Aggregation Example \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use collations with MongoDB to order your query or aggregation operation results by string values. A collation is a set of character ordering and matching rules that apply to a specific language and locale. You can learn more about collations in the following sections in this guide:      * Collations in MongoDB  * How to Specify Collations  * Collation Options  * Collation Code Examples \nCOLLATIONS IN MONGODB \nMongoDB sorts strings using binary collation by default. The binary collation uses the ASCII standard character values to compare and order strings. Certain languages and locales have specific character ordering conventions that differ from the ASCII character values. For example, in Canadian French, the right-most accented character (diacritic) determines the ordering for strings when all preceding characters are the same. Consider the following Canadian French words:  * cote  * coté  * côte  * côté When using binary collation, MongoDB sorts them in the following order: cotecotécôtecôté When using the Canadian French collation, MongoDB sorts them in a different order as shown below: cotecôtecotécôté \nHOW TO SPECIFY COLLATIONS \nMongoDB supports collations on most CRUD operations and aggregations. For a complete list of supported operations, see the Operations that Support Collations server manual page. You can specify the locale code and optional variant in the following string format: \"<locale code>@collation=<variant code>\" The following example specifies the \"de\" locale code and \"phonebook\" variant code: \"de@collation=phonebook\" If you do not need to specify a variant, omit everything after the locale code as follows: \"de\" For a complete list of supported locales, see our server manual page on Supported Languages and Locales. The following sections show you different ways to apply collations in MongoDB:  * Collection  * Index  * Operation \nCOLLECTION \nYou can set a default collation when you create a collection. When you create a collection with a specified collation, all supported operations that scan that collection apply the rules of the collation. You can only assign a default collation to a collection when you create that collection. However, you can specify a collation in a new index on an existing collection. See the Index section of this guide for more information. The following snippet shows how to specify the \"en_US\" locale collation when creating a new collection called items: database.createCollection(        \"items\",        new CreateCollectionOptions().collation(                Collation.builder().locale(\"en_US\").build()));  To check whether you created the collation successfully, retrieve a list of the indexes on that collection as follows: MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection(\"items\");\nList<Document> indexes = new ArrayList<>();collection.listIndexes().into(indexes);indexes.forEach(idx -> System.out.println(idx.toJson()));  The output of your code should contain the following: { ...  \"collation\": { \"locale\": \"en_US\", ... }  ...} \nINDEX \nYou can specify a collation when you create a new index on a collection. The index stores an ordered representation of the documents in the collection so your operation does not need to perform the ordering in-memory. To use the index, your operation must meet the following criteria:  * The operation uses the same collation as the one specified in the index.  * The operation is covered by the index that contains the collation. The following code snippet shows how you can create an index on the \"name\" field with the \"en_US\" locale collation in ascending order: MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection(\"items\");IndexOptions idxOptions = new IndexOptions();idxOptions.collation(Collation.builder().locale(\"en_US\").build());collection.createIndex(Indexes.ascending(\"name\"),

MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection(\"items\");\nList<Document> indexes = new ArrayList<>();collection.listIndexes().into(indexes);indexes.forEach(idx -> System.out.println(idx.toJson()));  The output of the preceding code should contain the following: { ...  \"collation\": { \"locale\": \"en_US\", ... }  ...} The following code snippet shows an example operation that specifies the same collation and is covered by the index we created in the preceding code snippet: FindIterable<Document> cursor = collection.find()        .collation(Collation.builder().locale(\"en_US\").build())        .sort(Sorts.ascending(\"name\"));  \nOPERATION \nYou can override the default collation on a collection by passing the new collation as a parameter to one of the supported operations. However, since the operation does not use an index, the operation may not perform as well as one that is covered by an index. For more information on the disadvantages of sorting operations not covered by an index, see the server manual page on Use Indexes to Sort Query Results. The following code snippet shows an example query operation with the following characteristics:  * The referenced collection contains the default collation \"en_US\" similar to the one specified in the Collection section.  * The query specifies the Icelandic (\"is\") collation which is not covered by the collection's default collation index.  * Since the specified collation is not covered by an index, the sort operation is performed in-memory. FindIterable<Document> cursor = collection.find()        .collation(Collation.builder().locale(\"is\").build())        .sort(Sorts.ascending(\"name\"));  \nINDEX TYPES THAT DO NOT SUPPORT COLLATIONS \nWhile most MongoDB index types support collation, the following types support only binary comparison:  * text  * 2d  * geoHaystack \nCOLLATION OPTIONS \nThis section covers various collation options and how to specify them to further refine the ordering and matching behavior. Collation Option\nDescription\nLocale\nRequired. The ICU locale code for language and variant.\nlocale() API Documentation\nBackwards\nWhether to consider diacritics from the end of the string first.\nbackwards() API Documentation\nCase-sensitivity\nWhether to consider case (upper or lower) as different values.\ncaseLevel() API Documentation\nAlternate\nWhether to consider spaces and punctuation.\ncollationAlternate() API Documentation\nCase First\nWhether to consider uppercase or lowercase first.\ncollationCaseFirst() API Documentation\nMax Variable\nWhether to ignore whitespace or both whitespace and punctuation. This setting is only valid when the alternate setting is \"shifted\".\ncollationMaxVariable() API Documentation\nStrength\nICU level of comparison. The default value is \"tertiary\". For more information on each level, see the ICU Comparison Levels.\ncollationStrength() API Documentation\nNormalization\nWhether to perform unicode normalization on the text as needed. For more information on unicode normalization, see Unicode Normalization Forms.\nnormalization() API Documentation\nNumeric Ordering\nWhether to order numbers according to numeric value rather than collation order.\nnumericOrdering() API Documentation You can use the Collation.Builder class to specify values for the preceding collation options. You can call the build() method to construct a Collation object as shown in the following code snippet: Collation.builder().caseLevel(true).collationAlternate(CollationAlternate.SHIFTED).collationCaseFirst(CollationCaseFirst.UPPER).collationMaxVariable(CollationMaxVariable.SPACE).collationStrength(CollationStrength.SECONDARY).locale(\"en_US\").normalization(false).numericOrdering(true).build();  For more information on the corresponding methods and parameters they take, see the API Documentation for Collation.Builder. \nCOLLATION EXAMPLES \nThis section contains examples that demonstrate how to use a selection of MongoDB operations that support collations.

 In the following examples, we specify the \"de@collation=phonebook\" locale and variant collation. The \"de\" part of the collation specifies the German locale and the \"collation=phonebook\" part specifies a variant. The \"de\" locale collation contains rules for prioritizing proper nouns, identified by capitalization of the first letter. In the \"collation=phonebook\" variant, characters with umlauts are ordered before the same characters without them in an ascending sort. \nFIND() AND SORT() EXAMPLE \nThe following example demonstrates how you can apply a collation when retrieving sorted results from a collection. To perform this operation, call find() on the example collection and chain the collation() and sort() methods to specify the order in which you want to receive the results. \nNOTE The following code example uses imports from the import com.mongodb.client.model package for convenience. List<Document> results = new ArrayList<>();collection.find()        .collation(Collation.builder().locale(\"de@collation=phonebook\").build())        .sort(Sorts.ascending(\"first_name\")).into(results);if (results != null) {    results.forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));}  When we perform this operation on our example collection, the output should resemble the following: {\"_id\": 3, \"first_name\": \"Günter\"}{\"_id\": 2, \"first_name\": \"Gunter\"}{\"_id\": 5, \"first_name\": \"Hannah\"}{\"_id\": 4, \"first_name\": \"Jürgen\"}{\"_id\": 1, \"first_name\": \"Klara\"} For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * find()  * sort()  * Sorts \nFINDONEANDUPDATE() EXAMPLE \nThis section demonstrates how you can specify a collation in an operation that updates the first match from your query. To specify the collation for this operation, instantiate a FindOneAndUpdateOptions object, set a collation on it, and pass it as a parameter to your call to the findOneAndUpdate() method. In this example, we demonstrate the following:  * Retrieve the first document in our example collection that precedes \"Gunter\" in an ascending order.  * Set options for operation including the \"de@collation=phonebook\" collation.  * Add a new field \"verified\" with the value \"true\".  * Retrieve and print the updated document. \nNOTE The following code example uses imports from the import com.mongodb.client.model package for convenience. Document result = collection.findOneAndUpdate(        Filters.gt(\"first_name\", \"Gunter\"),        Updates.set(\"verified\", true),        new FindOneAndUpdateOptions()                .collation(Collation.builder().locale(\"de@collation=phonebook\").build())                .sort(Sorts.ascending(\"first_name\"))                .returnDocument(ReturnDocument.AFTER));if (result != null) {    System.out.println(\"Updated document: \" + result.toJson());}  Since \"Günter\" is lexically before \"Gunter\" using the de@collation=phonebook collation in ascending order, the preceding operation returns the following update document: {  lastErrorObject: { updatedExisting: true, n: 1 },  value: { _id: 3, first_name: 'Günter' },  ok: 1} For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * findOneAndUpdate  * findOneAndUpdateOptions  * Filters  * Updates  * Sorts \nFINDONEANDDELETE() EXAMPLE \nThis section demonstrates how you can specify a numerical ordering of strings in a collation in an operation that deletes the first match from your query. To specify the collation for this operation, instantiate a FindOneAndDeleteOptions object, set a numeric ordering collation on it, and pass it as a parameter to your call to the findOneAndDelete() method.

 In the collation, we set the locale option to \"en\" and the numericOrdering option to \"true\" in order to sort strings based on their numerical order. \nNOTE The following code example uses imports

If we perform the same operation without the numerical ordering collation on the original collection of three documents, the filter matches all of our documents since \"100\" comes before \"16\", \"84\", and \"179\" when ordering by binary collation.

In an aggregation operation, you can specify a series of aggregation stages which is collectively called the aggregation pipeline. To perform an aggregation, call the aggregate() method on a MongoCollection object. To specify a collation for an aggregation operation, call the collation() method on the AggregateIterable returned by the aggregation operation. Make sure to specify a sort aggregation stage on which to apply the collation in your aggregation pipeline. The following example shows how we can construct an aggregation pipeline on the example collection and apply a collation by specifying the following:  * A group aggregation stage using the Aggregates.group() helper to identify each document by the first_name field and use that value as the _id of the result.  * An accumulator in the group aggregation stage to sum the number of instances of matching values in the first_name field.  * Apply an ascending sort to the _id field of the output documents of the prior aggregation stage.  * Construct a collation object, specifying the German locale and a collation strength that ignores accents and umlauts. Bson groupStage = Aggregates.group(\"$first_name\", Accumulators.sum(\"nameCount\", 1));Bson sortStage = Aggregates.sort(Sorts.ascending(\"_id\"));AggregateIterable<Document> results = collection        .aggregate(Arrays.asList(groupStage, sortStage))        .collation(Collation.builder().locale(\"de\").collationStrength(CollationStrength.PRIMARY).build());if (results != null) {    results.forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));}  The preceding code outputs the following documents: {\"_id\": \"Gunter\", \"nameCount\": 2}{\"_id\": \"Hannah\", \"nameCount\": 1}{\"_id\": \"Jürgen\", \"nameCount\": 1}{\"_id\": \"Klara\", \"nameCount\": 1} For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * aggregate()  *

Connection Pool Events with JMX\n * JMX Support\n * JMX and JConsole Example\n * Include the Driver in Your Distributed Tracing System \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to set up and configure monitoring in the MongoDB Java driver. Monitoring is the process of getting information about the activities a running program performs for use in an application or an application performance management library. Monitoring the MongoDB Java driver lets you understand the driver's resource usage and performance, and can help you make informed decisions when designing and debugging your application. In this guide you will learn how to perform these tasks:      * Monitor different types of events in the MongoDB Java Driver  * Monitor connection pool events with Java Management Extensions (JMX) and JConsole This guide shows how to use information about the activity of the driver in code. If you would like to learn how to record events in the driver, consider reading our guide on logging. \nMONITOR EVENTS \nTo monitor an event, you must register a listener on your MongoClient instance. An event is any action that happens in a running program. The driver includes functionality for listening to a subset of the events that occur when the driver is running. A listener is a class that performs some action when certain events occur. A listener's API defines the events it can respond to. Each method of a listener class represents a response to a certain event. Each method receives one argument: an object representing the event the method responds to. The MongoDB Java driver organizes the events it defines into three categories:  * Command Events  * Server Discovery and Monitoring Events  * Connection Pool Events The following sections show how to monitor each event category. For a full list of the events you can monitor, see the event package of the MongoDB Java Driver. \nCOMMAND EVENTS \nA command event is an event related to a MongoDB database command. Some examples of database commands that produce command events are find, insert, delete, and count. To monitor command events, write a class that implements the CommandListener interface and register an instance of that class with your MongoClient instance. For more information on MongoDB database commands, see the MongoDB manual entry on database commands. \nNOTE \nINTERNAL COMMANDS The driver does not publish events for commands it calls internally. This includes database commands the driver uses to monitor your cluster and commands related to connection establishment (such as the initial hello command). \nIMPORTANT \nREDACTED OUTPUT As a security measure, the driver redacts the contents of some command events. This protects the sensitive information contained in these command events. For a full list of redacted command events, see the MongoDB command logging and monitoring specification. EXAMPLE \nThis example shows how to make a counter for database commands. The counter keeps track of the number of times the driver successfully executes each database command, and prints this information every time a database command finishes. To make a counter, do the following:  1. Make a class with counter functionality that implements the CommandListener interface.  2. Add an instance of the new class that implements CommandListener to a MongoClientSettings object.  3. Configure a MongoClient instance with the MongoClientSettings object. The following code defines the CommandCounter class which implements the CommandListener interface: class CommandCounter implements CommandListener {\n    private Map<String, Integer> commands = new HashMap<String, Integer>();\n    @Override    public synchronized void commandSucceeded(final CommandSucceededEvent event) {        String commandName = event.getCommandName();        int count = commands.containsKey(commandName) ? commands.get(commandName) : 0;        commands.put(commandName, count + 1);        System.out.println(commands.toString());    }\n    @Override    public void commandFailed(final CommandFailedEvent event) {        System.out.println(String.format(\"Failed execution of command '%s' with id %s\",                event.getCommandName(),

MongoClient  * CommandStartedEvent  * CommandSucceededEvent  * CommandFailedEvent \nSERVER DISCOVERY AND MONITORING EVENTS \nA server discovery and monitoring (SDAM) event is an event related to a change in the state of the MongoDB instance or cluster you have connected the driver to. The driver defines nine SDAM events. The driver divides these nine events between three separate listener interfaces which each listen for three of the nine events. Here are the three interfaces and the events they listen for:  * ClusterListener: topology related events  * ServerListener: events related to mongod or mongos processes  * ServerMonitorListener: heartbeat related events To monitor a type of SDAM event, write a class that implements one of the three preceding interfaces and register an instance of that class with your MongoClient instance. For a detailed description of each SDAM event in the driver, see the MongoDB SDAM monitoring specification. EXAMPLE \nThis example shows how to make a listener class that prints a message that lets you know if the driver can write to your MongoDB instance. The following code defines the IsWritable class which implements the ClusterListener interface. class IsWriteable implements ClusterListener {\n    private boolean isWritable;\n    @Override    public synchronized void clusterDescriptionChanged(final ClusterDescriptionChangedEvent event) {        if (!isWritable) {            if (event.getNewDescription().hasWritableServer()) {                isWritable = true;                System.out.println(\"Able to write to server\");            }        } else {            if (!event.getNewDescription().hasWritableServer()) {                isWritable = false;                System.out.println(\"Unable to write to server\");            }        }    }}  The following code adds an instance of the IsWritable class to a MongoClient object. The code then runs a find operation to test the IsWritable class. IsWriteable clusterListener = new IsWriteable();MongoClientSettings settings =        MongoClientSettings.builder()                .applyConnectionString(URI)                .applyToClusterSettings(builder ->                        builder.addClusterListener(clusterListener))                .build();MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(settings);MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase(DATABASE);MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection(COLLECTION);// Run a command to trigger a ClusterDescriptionChangedEvent eventcollection.find().first();  The preceding code snippet should produce output that looks like this: Able to write to server For more information on the classes and methods mentioned in this

\nA connection pool event is an event related to a connection pool held by the driver. A connection pool is a set of open TCP connections your driver maintains with a MongoDB instance. Connection pools help reduce the number of network handshakes your application needs to perform with a MongoDB instance, and can help your application run faster. To monitor connection pool events, write a class that implements the ConnectionPoolListener interface and register an instance of that class with your MongoClient instance. EXAMPLE \nThis example shows how to make a listener class that prints a message each time you check out a connection from your connection pool. The following code defines the ConnectionPoolLibrarian class which implements the ConnectionPoolListener interface. class ConnectionPoolLibrarian implements ConnectionPoolListener {\n    @Override    public void connectionCheckedOut(final ConnectionCheckedOutEvent event) {        System.out.println(String.format(\"Let me get you the connection with id %s...\",                event.getConnectionId().getLocalValue()));    }\n    @Override    public void connectionCheckOutFailed(final ConnectionCheckOutFailedEvent event) {        System.out.println(\"Something went wrong! Failed to checkout connection.\");    }\n}  The following code adds an instance of the ConnectionPoolLibrarian class to a MongoClient object. The code then runs a database command to test the librarian.

JMX provides tools to monitor applications and devices. For more information on JMX, see the official Oracle JMX documentation. \nJMX SUPPORT \nTo enable JMX connection pool monitoring, add an instance of the JMXConnectionPoolListener class to your MongoClient object. The JMXConnectionPoolListener class performs the following actions:  1. Creates MXBean instances for each mongod or mongos process the driver maintains a connection pool with.  2. Registers these MXBean instances with the platform MBean server. MXBeans registered on the platform MBean server have the following properties: Property\nDescription\nclusterId\nA client-generated unique identifier. This identifier ensures that each MXBean the driver makes has a unique name when an application has multiple MongoClient instances connected to the same MongoDB deployment.\nhost\nThe hostname of the machine running the mongod or mongos process.\nport\nThe port on which the mongod or mongos process is listening.\nminSize\nThe minimum size of the connection pool, including idle and in-use connections.\nmaxSize\nThe maximum size of the connection pool, including idle and in-use connections.\nsize\nThe current size of the connection pool, including idle and in-use connections.\ncheckedOutCount\nThe current count of connections that are in use. All MXBean instances created by the driver are under the domain \"org.mongodb.driver\".

Codec \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to store and retrieve data in the MongoDB Java Driver using Java records. Java records are a type of Java class often used to model data and separate business logic from data representation. \nTIP You can declare Java records in Java 16 or later. Learn more about the functionality and restrictions of records from Java 17 Language Updates: Record Classes. If you are using an earlier version of Java, you can use plain old Java objects instead. See the Document Data Format: POJOs guide for implementation details. \nNOTE If you are using the driver in an OSGi container and your application uses the driver to encode or decode Java records, you must add an explicit dependency on the org.bson.codecs.record module. Learn more about defining dependencies for OSGi containers in the IBM OSGi documentation. \nSERIALIZE AND DESERIALIZE A RECORD \nThe driver natively supports encoding and decoding Java records for MongoDB read and write operations using the default codec registry. The default codec registry is a collection of classes called codecs that define how to convert encode and decode Java types. Learn more about codecs and the default codec registry in the guide on Codecs. \nEXAMPLE RECORD \nThe code examples in this section reference the following sample record, which describes a data storage device: public record DataStorageRecord(        String productName,        double capacity) {}  \nINSERT A RECORD \nYou can insert a DataStorageRecord instance as shown in the following code: MongoCollection<DataStorageRecord> collection = database.getCollection(\"data_storage_devices\", DataStorageRecord.class);\n// insert the recordcollection.insertOne(new DataStorageRecord(\"2TB SSD\", 1.71));  \nRETRIEVE A RECORD \nYou can retrieve documents as DataStorageRecord instances and print them as shown in the following code: MongoCollection<DataStorageRecord> collection = database.getCollection(\"data_storage_devices\", DataStorageRecord.class);\n// retrieve and print the recordsList<DataStorageRecord> records = new ArrayList<DataStorageRecord>();collection.find().into(records);records.forEach(System.out::println); \nHIDE OUTPUT DataStorageRecord[productName=1TB SSD, capacity=1.71] \nSPECIFY COMPONENT CONVERSION USING ANNOTATIONS \nThis section describes the annotations you can use to configure the serialization behavior of record components and provides an example to demonstrate the annotation behavior. \nTIP The org.bson.codecs.records.annotations package is deprecated. Use the equivalent ones from the org.bson.codecs.pojo.annotations package instead. You can use the following annotations on record components: Annotation Name\nDescription\nBsonId\nSpecifies the component to serialize as the _id property.\nBsonProperty\nSpecifies a custom document field name when converting the record component to BSON. Accepts the field name as the parameter.\nBsonRepresentation\nSpecifies a BSON type to store when different from the record component type. Accepts the BSON type as the parameter. \nNOTE The driver supports annotations for Java records, but only if you include them when you define the component as shown in the following example record.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nCODECS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Codec\n * CodecRegistry\n * CodecProvider\n * Default Codec Registry\n * BsonTypeClassMap\n * Custom Codec Example \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn about Codecs and the supporting classes that handle the encoding and decoding of Java objects to and from BSON data in the MongoDB Java driver. The Codec abstraction allows you to map any Java type to a corresponding BSON type. You can use this to map your domain objects directly to and from BSON instead of using an intermediate map-based object such as Document or BsonDocument. You can learn how to specify custom encoding and decoding logic using the Codec abstraction and view example implementations in the following sections:      * Codec  * CodecRegistry  * CodecProvider  * Custom Codec Example If you are customizing encoding and decoding logic for plain old Java objects (POJOs), read our guide on POJO Customization. \nCODEC \nThe Codec interface contains abstract methods for serializing and deserializing Java objects to BSON data. You can define your conversion logic between BSON and your Java object in your implementation of this interface. To implement the Codec interface, override the encode(), decode(), and getEncoderClass() abstract methods. The encode() method requires the following parameters: Parameter Type\nDescription\nwriter\nAn instance of a class that implements BsonWriter, an interface type that exposes methods for writing a BSON document. For example, the BsonBinaryWriter implementation writes to a binary stream of data. Use this instance to write your BSON value using the appropriate write method.\nvalue\nThe data that your implementation encodes. The type must match the type variable assigned to your implementation.\nencoderContext\nContains meta information about the Java object data that it encodes to BSON including whether to store the current value in a MongoDB collection. This method uses the BsonWriter instance to send the encoded value to MongoDB and does not return a value. The decode() method returns your Java object instance populated with the value from the BSON data. This method requires the following parameters: Parameter Type\nDescription\nbsonReader\nAn instance of a class that implements BsonReader, an interface type that exposes methods for reading a BSON document. For example, the BsonBinaryReader implementation reads from a binary stream of data.\ndecoderContext\nContains information about the BSON data that it decodes to a Java object. The getEncoderClass() method returns a class instance of the Java class since Java cannot infer the type due to type erasure. See the following code examples that show how you can implement a custom Codec. The PowerStatus enum contains the values \"ON\" and \"OFF\" to represent the states of an electrical switch. public enum PowerStatus {    ON,    OFF}  The PowerStatusCodec class implements Codec in order to convert the Java enum values to corresponding BSON boolean values. The encode() method converts a PowerStatus to a BSON boolean and the decode() method performs the conversion in the opposite direction. public class PowerStatusCodec implements Codec<PowerStatus> {\n    @Override    public void encode(BsonWriter writer, PowerStatus value, EncoderContext encoderContext) {        if (value != null) {            writer.writeBoolean(value.equals(PowerStatus.ON) ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE);        }    }\n    @Override    public PowerStatus decode(BsonReader reader, DecoderContext decoderContext) {        return reader.readBoolean() ? PowerStatus.ON : PowerStatus.OFF;    }\n    @Override    public Class<PowerStatus> getEncoderClass() {        return PowerStatus.class;    }}  You can add an instance of the PowerStatusCodec to your CodecRegistry which contains a mapping between your Codec and the Java object type to which it applies. Continue to the CodecRegistry section of this page to see how you can include your Codec.

 * fromCodecs()  * fromProviders()  * fromRegistries() The following code snippet shows how to construct a CodecRegistry using the fromCodecs() method: CodecRegistry codecRegistry = CodecRegistries.fromCodecs(new IntegerCodec(), new PowerStatusCodec());  In the preceding example, we assign the CodecRegistry the following Codec implementations:  * IntegerCodec, a Codec that converts Integers and is part of the BSON package.  * PowerStatusCodec, our sample Codec that converts certain Java strings to BSON booleans. You can retrieve the Codec instances from the CodecRegistry instance from the prior example using the following code: Codec<String> powerStatusCodec = codecRegistry.get(String.class);Codec<Integer> integerCodec = codecRegistry.get(Integer.class);  If you attempt to retrieve a Codec instance for a class that is not registered, the get() method throws a CodecConfigurationException exception. For more information about the classes and interfaces in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * CodecRegistries  * IntegerCodec \nCODECPROVIDER \nA CodecProvider is an interface that contains abstract methods that create Codec instances and assign them to a CodecRegistry instance. Similar to the CodecRegistry, the BSON library uses the Codec instances retrieved by the get() method to convert between Java and BSON data types. However, in cases in which you add a class that contains fields that require corresponding Codec objects, you need to ensure that you instantiate the Codec objects for the class' fields before you instantiate the Codec for the class. You can use the CodecRegistry parameter in the get() method to pass any of the Codec instances that the Codec relies on. The following code example shows how you can implement CodecProvider to pass the MonolightCodec any Codec instances it needs in a CodecRegistry instance such as the PowerStatusCodec from our prior example: public class MonolightCodecProvider implements CodecProvider {\n    public MonolightCodecProvider() {}\n    @Override    @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")    public <T> Codec<T> get(Class<T> clazz, CodecRegistry registry) {        if (clazz == Monolight.class) {            return (Codec<T>) new MonolightCodec(registry);        }\n        // return null when not a provider for the requested class        return null;    }\n}  To see a runnable example that demonstrates read and write operations using these Codec classes, see the Custom Codec Example section of this guide. When working with POJOs, consider using the PojoCodecProvider to minimize duplicate code to convert commonly-used data types and customize their behavior. See our POJO Customization guide for more information. \nDEFAULT CODEC REGISTRY \nThe default codec registry is a set of CodecProvider classes that specify conversion between commonly-used Java and MongoDB types. The driver automatically uses the default codec registry unless you specify a different one. If you need to override the behavior of one or more Codec classes, but keep the behavior from the default codec registry for the other classes, you can specify all of the registries in order of precedence. For example, suppose you wanted to override the default provider behavior of a Codec for enum types with your custom MyEnumCodec, you must add it to the registry list prior to the default codec registry as shown in the example below: CodecRegistry newRegistry = CodecRegistries.fromRegistries(    CodecRegistries.fromCodecs(new MyEnumCodec()),    MongoClientSettings.getDefaultCodecRegistry());  For more information about the classes and interfaces in this section, see the following API documentation sections:  * CodecProvider  * Default codec registry \nBSONTYPECLASSMAP \nThe BsonTypeClassMap class contains a recommended mapping between BSON and Java types. You can use this class in your custom Codec or CodecProvider to help you manage which Java types to decode your BSON types to container classes that implement Iterable or Map such as the Document class. You can add or modify the BsonTypeClassMap default mapping by passing a Map containing new or replacement entries. The following code snippet shows how you can retrieve the Java class type that corresponds to the BSON type in the default BsonTypeClassMap

 This code outputs the following: Java type: java.util.List You can modify these mappings in your instance by specifying replacements in the BsonTypeClassMap constructor. The following code snippet shows how you can replace the mapping for ARRAY in your BsonTypeClassMap instance with the Set class: Map<BsonType, Class<?>> replacements = new HashMap<BsonType, Class<?>>();replacements.put(BsonType.ARRAY, Set.class);BsonTypeClassMap bsonTypeClassMap = new BsonTypeClassMap(replacements);\nClass<?> clazz = bsonTypeClassMap.get(BsonType.ARRAY);System.out.println(\"Java type: \" + clazz.getName());  This code outputs the following: Java type: java.util.Set For a complete list of the default mappings, refer to the BsonTypeClassMap API Documentation. For an example of how the Document class uses BsonTypeClassMap, see the driver source code for the following classes:  * DocumentCodecProvider  * DocumentCodec \nCUSTOM CODEC EXAMPLE \nIn this section, we show how you can implement Codec and CodecProvider to define the encoding and decoding logic for a custom Java class. We also show how you can specify and use your custom implementations to perform insert and retrieve operations. The following code snippet shows our example custom class called Monolight and its fields that we want to store and retrieve from a MongoDB collection: public class Monolight {    private PowerStatus powerStatus = PowerStatus.OFF;    private Integer colorTemperature;\n    public Monolight() {}\n    // ...  This class contains the following fields, each of which we need to assign a Codec:  * powerStatus describes whether the light is switched \"on\" or \"off\" for which we use the PowerStatusCodec that converts specific enum values to BSON booleans.  * colorTemperature describes the color of the light and contains an Integer value for which we use the IntegerCodec included in the BSON library.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nDOCUMENTS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Document\n * BsonDocument\n * JsonObject\n * BasicDBObject\n * Summary \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use documents in the MongoDB Java Driver. A MongoDB document is a data structure that contains key/value fields in binary JSON (BSON) format. You can use documents and the data they contain in their fields to store data as well as issue commands or queries in MongoDB. For more information on the terminology, structure, and limitations of documents, read our page on Documents in the MongoDB manual. The MongoDB Java driver and BSON library include the following classes that help you access and manipulate the BSON data in documents: Name\nPackage\nImplements Map\nRecommended Usage\nDocument\norg.bson\nYes, implements Map<String, Object>\nWhen you want a flexible and concise data representation.\nBsonDocument\norg.bson\nYes, implements Map<String, BsonValue>\nWhen you need a type-safe API.\nJsonObject\norg.bson.json\nNo\nWhen you only want to work with JSON strings.\nBasicDBObject\ncom.mongodb\nNo\nWhen you are migrating your application from a legacy driver version. While you can use any of these classes in your application, we recommend that you use the Document class since it can concisely represent dynamically structured documents of any complexity. It implements the Map<String, Object> interface which enables it to use loosely-typed values. \nDOCUMENT \nThe Document class offers a flexible representation of a BSON document. You can access and manipulate fields using Java types from the standard library with this class. See the following table for mappings between frequently-used BSON and Java types: BSON type\nJava type\nArray\njava.util.List\nBinary\norg.bson.types.Binary\nBoolean\njava.lang.Boolean\nDate\njava.util.Date\nDocument\norg.bson.Document\nDouble\njava.lang.Double\nInt32\njava.lang.Integer\nInt64\njava.lang.Long\nNull\nnull\nObjectId\norg.bson.types.ObjectId\nString\njava.lang.String The preceding mapping table shows the default mapping when working with the Document class. You can customize the type mapping by specifying a custom codec. For more information on customizing mapped types, see our guide on using Codecs. In the following code snippet, we show how to instantiate and build a sample Document instance representing a document containing several different field types: Document author = new Document(\"_id\", new ObjectId())    .append(\"name\", \"Gabriel García Márquez\")    .append(\"dateOfDeath\", Date.from(LocalDate.of(2014, 4, 17).atStartOfDay(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toInstant()))    .append(\"novels\", Arrays.asList(        new Document(\"title\", \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\").append(\"yearPublished\", 1967),        new Document(\"title\", \"Chronicle of a Death Foretold\").append(\"yearPublished\", 1981),        new Document(\"title\", \"Love in the Time of Cholera\").append(\"yearPublished\", 1985)));  To insert this document into a collection, instantiate a collection using the getCollection() method and call the insertOne operation as follows: // MongoClient mongoClient = <code to instantiate your client>;\nMongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase(\"fundamentals_data\");MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection(\"authors\");\nInsertOneResult result = collection.insertOne(author);  Once you perform a

See the following table for mappings between frequently-used BSON and Java BSON library types: BSON type\nJava BSON library type\nArray\norg.bson.BsonArray\nBinary\norg.bson.BsonBinary\nBoolean\norg.bson.Boolean\nDate (long value)\norg.bson.BsonDateTime\nDocument\norg.bson.BsonDocument\nDouble\norg.bson.BsonDouble\nInt32\norg.bson.BsonInt32\nInt64\norg.bson.BsonInt64\nNull\norg.bson.BsonNull\nObjectId\norg.bson.BsonObjectId\nString\norg.bson.BsonString In the following code snippet, we show how to instantiate and build a sample BsonDocument instance representing a document containing several different field types: BsonDocument author = new BsonDocument()    .append(\"_id\", new BsonObjectId())    .append(\"name\", new BsonString(\"Gabriel García Márquez\"))    .append(\"dateOfDeath\", new BsonDateTime(LocalDate.of(2014, 4, 17).atStartOfDay(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toInstant().toEpochMilli()))    .append(\"novels\", new BsonArray(Arrays.asList(        new BsonDocument().append(\"title\", new BsonString(\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\")).append(\"yearPublished\", new BsonInt32(1967)),        new BsonDocument().append(\"title\", new BsonString(\"Chronicle of a Death Foretold\")).append(\"yearPublished\", new BsonInt32(1981)),        new BsonDocument().append(\"title\", new BsonString(\"Love in the Time of Cholera\")).append(\"yearPublished\", new BsonInt32(1985))   )));  To insert this document into a collection, instantiate a collection using the getCollection() method specifying the BsonDocument class as the documentClass parameter. Then, call the insertOne operation as follows: // MongoClient mongoClient = <code to instantiate your client>;\nMongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase(\"fundamentals_data\");MongoCollection<BsonDocument> collection = database.getCollection(\"authors\", BsonDocument.class);\nInsertOneResult result =

 \nTIP The preceding code sample uses helper methods that check the returned type and throw a BsonInvalidOperationException if it is unable to cast the field value. You can call the get() method specified by the Map interface to retrieve field values as type BsonValue and to skip type checking. The output should look something like this: _id: 5fb5fad05f734e3794741a35, name: Gabriel García Márquez, dateOfDeath: Thu Apr 17 00:00:00 EDT 2014title: One Hundred Years of Solitude, yearPublished: 1967title: Chronicle of a Death Foretold, yearPublished: 1981title: Love in the Time of Cholera, yearPublished: 1985 For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * BsonDocument  * getCollection()  * BsonInvalidOperationException  * get()  * BsonValue \nJSONOBJECT \nThe JsonObject class acts as a wrapper for JSON strings. If you only want to work with JSON data, you can use JsonObject to avoid unnecessary data conversion to a Map object. By default, JsonObject stores Extended JSON. You can customize the format of JSON in JsonObject by specifying a JsonObjectCodec and passing it a JsonWriterSettings object. For more information on JSON formats, see our Extended JSON guide. For more information on specifying codecs, see our Codecs guide. In the following code snippet, we show how to instantiate a sample JsonObject instance wrapping an Extended JSON string containing different types of key value pairs: String ejsonStr = \"{\\\"_id\\\": {\\\"$oid\\\": \\\"6035210f35bd203721c3eab8\\\"},\"        + \"\\\"name\\\": \\\"Gabriel Garc\\\\u00eda M\\\\u00e1rquez\\\",\"        + \"\\\"dateOfDeath\\\": {\\\"$date\\\": \\\"2014-04-17T04:00:00Z\\\"},\"        + \"\\\"novels\\\": [\"        + \"{\\\"title\\\": \\\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\\",\\\"yearPublished\\\": 1967},\"        + \"{\\\"title\\\": \\\"Chronicle of a Death Foretold\\\",\\\"yearPublished\\\": 1981},\"        + \"{\\\"title\\\": \\\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\\",\\\"yearPublished\\\": 1985}]}\";JsonObject author = new JsonObject(ejsonStr);  To insert this document into a collection, instantiate a collection using the getCollection() method specifying the JsonObject class as the documentClass parameter. Then, call the insertOne operation as follows: // MongoClient mongoClient = <code to instantiate your client>;\nMongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase(\"fundamentals_data\");MongoCollection<JsonObject> collection = database.getCollection(\"authors\", JsonObject.class);\nInsertOneResult result = collection.insertOne(author);  Once you perform a successful insert, you can retrieve the sample JSON data from the collection. While you can use any class that extends Bson to specify your query, here is how to query your data using a JsonObject: // MongoClient mongoClient = <code to instantiate your client>;\nJsonObject query = new JsonObject(\"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"Gabriel Garc\\\\u00eda M\\\\u00e1rquez\\\"}\");JsonObject jsonResult = collection.find(query).first();if (jsonResult != null) {    System.out.println(\"query result in extended json format: \" + jsonResult.getJson());}  The output should look something like this: query result in extended json format: {\"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"6035210f35bd203721c3eab8\"}, \"name\": \"Gabriel García Márquez\", \"dateOfDeath\": {\"$date\": \"2014-04-17T04:00:00Z\"}, \"novels\": [{\"title\": \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\", \"yearPublished\": 1967}, {\"title\": \"Chronicle of a Death Foretold\", \"yearPublished\": 1981}, {\"title\": \"Love in the Time of Cholera\", \"yearPublished\": 1985}]} \nTIP If you would like to

JsonObjectCodec  * JsonWriterSettings  * getCollection() \nBASICDBOBJECT \nThe BasicDBObject class allows you to access and manipulate document data using Java types. We recommend that you avoid using this class unless you are migrating an application from an older driver version because of the following limitations:  * BasicDBObject does not implement Map<K, V>

to store and retrieve data in the MongoDB Java driver using plain old Java objects (POJOs). POJOs are often used for data encapsulation, separating business logic from data representation. The example in this guide shows how to perform the following:      * Configure the driver to serialize and deserialize POJOs  * How to read and write to documents using POJOs \nEXAMPLE POJO \nTo follow the steps in this guide, use the following sample POJO class which describes characteristics of a flower: public class Flower {\n    private ObjectId id;    private String name;    private List<String> colors;    private Boolean isBlooming;    private Float height;\n    // public empty constructor needed for retrieving the POJO    public Flower() {}\n    public Flower(String name, Boolean isBlooming, Float height, List<String> colors) {        this.name = name;        this.isBlooming = isBlooming;        this.height = height;        this.colors = colors;    }\n    public ObjectId getId() {        return id;    }\n    public void setId(ObjectId id) {        this.id = id;    }\n    public String getName() {        return name;    }\n    public void setName(String name) {        this.name = name;    }\n    public Boolean getIsBlooming() {        return isBlooming;    }\n    public void setIsBlooming(Boolean isBlooming) {        this.isBlooming = isBlooming;    }\n    public Float getHeight() {        return height;    }\n    public void setHeight(Float height) {        this.height = height;    }\n    public List<String> getColors() {        return colors;    }\n    public void setColors(List<String> colors) {        this.colors = colors;    }\n    @Override    public String toString() {        return \"Flower [id=\" + id + \", name=\" + name + \", colors=\" + colors + \", isBlooming=\" + isBlooming + \", height=\" + height + \"]\";    }}  If you are creating your own POJO for storing and retrieving data in MongoDB, make sure to follow these guidelines:  * The POJO class should not implement interfaces or extend classes from a framework.  * Include all the fields for which you want to store and retrieve data; make sure they are not static or transient.  * If you include public getter or setter methods using the JavaBean naming conventions in your POJO, the driver calls them when serializing or deserializing data. If you omit the getter or setter methods for a public property field, the driver accesses or assigns them directly. \nCONFIGURE THE DRIVER FOR POJOS \nTo set up the driver to store and retrieve POJOs, we need to specify:  * The PojoCodecProvider, a codec provider that includes Codecs that define how to encode/decode the data between the POJO and MongoDB document, and which POJO classes or packages that the codecs should apply to.  * A CodecRegistry instance that contains the codecs and other related information.  * A MongoDatabase or MongoCollection instance configured to use the CodecRegistry.  * A MongoCollection instance created with the POJO document class bound to the TDocument generic type.

Classes\n * Using the BSON Library\n * Write Extended JSON\n * Using the Document Classes\n * Using the BSON Library\n * Custom BSON Type Conversion \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use the Extended JSON format in the MongoDB Java driver. JSON is a data format that represents the values of objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and nulls. The Extended JSON format defines a reserved set of keys prefixed with \"$\" to represent field type information that directly corresponds to each type in BSON, the format that MongoDB uses to store data. This guide explains the following topics:      * The different MongoDB Extended JSON formats  * How to use the BSON library to convert between Extended JSON and Java objects  * How to create a custom conversion of BSON types For more information on the difference between these formats, see our article on JSON and BSON. \nEXTENDED JSON FORMATS \nMongoDB Extended JSON features different string formats to represent BSON data. Each of the different formats conform to the JSON RFC and meet specific use cases. The extended format, also known as the canonical format, features specific representations for every BSON type for bidirectional conversion without loss of information. The Relaxed mode format is more concise and closer to ordinary JSON, but does not represent all the type information such as the specific byte size of number fields. See the following table to see a description of each format: Name\nDescription\nExtended\nAlso known as the canonical format, this JSON representation avoids loss of BSON type information.\nThis format prioritizes type preservation at the loss of human-readability and interoperability with older formats.\nRelaxed Mode\nJSON representation that describes BSON documents with some type information loss.\nThis format prioritizes human-readability and interoperability at the loss of certain type information.\nShell\nJSON representation that matches the syntax used in the MongoDB shell.\nThis format prioritizes compatibility with the MongoDB shell which often uses JavaScript functions to represent types.\nStrict\nDeprecated. This representation is the legacy format that fully conforms to the JSON RFC which allows any JSON parser to read the type information.\nThe legacy API uses this format. \nNOTE The driver parses the $uuid Extended JSON type from a string to a BsonBinary object of binary subtype 4. For more information about $uuid field parsing, see the special rules for parsing $uuid fields section in the extended JSON specification. For more detailed information on these formats, see the following resources:  * JSON RFC Official Documentation  * MongoDB Extended JSON Server Manual Entry  * BsonBinary API Documentation  * Extended JSON specification GitHub Documentation \nEXTENDED JSON EXAMPLES \nThe following examples show a document containing an ObjectId, date, and long number field represented in each Extended JSON format. Click the tab that corresponds to the format of the example you want to see:   READ EXTENDED JSON  USING THE DOCUMENT CLASSES \nYou can read an Extended JSON string into a Java document object by calling the parse() static method from either the Document or BsonDocument class, depending on which object type you need. This method parses the Extended JSON string in any of the formats and returns an instance of that class containing the data. The following example shows how you can use the Document class to read an example Extended JSON string into a Document object using the parse() method: String ejsonStr = \"{ \\\"_id\\\": { \\\"$oid\\\": \\\"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\\\"},\" +                  \"\\\"myNumber\\\": {\\\"$numberLong\\\": \\\"4794261\\\" }}}\";\nDocument doc = Document.parse(ejsonStr);System.out.println(doc);  The output of the preceding code should look something like this: Document{{_id=507f1f77bcf86cd799439011, myNumber=4794261}} For more information, see our Fundamentals page on Documents. \nUSING THE BSON LIBRARY \nYou can also read an Extended JSON string into Java objects without using the MongoDB Java driver's document classes by using the JsonReader class. This class contains methods to sequentially parse the fields and values in any format of the Extended JSON string, and returns them as Java objects.

BsonDocument by calling the toJson() method, optionally passing it an instance of JsonWriterSettings to specify the Extended JSON format. In this example, we output the Extended JSON in the Relaxed mode format. Document myDoc = new Document();myDoc.append(\"_id\", new ObjectId(\"507f1f77bcf86cd799439012\")).append(\"myNumber\", 11223344);\nJsonWriterSettings settings = JsonWriterSettings.builder().outputMode(JsonMode.RELAXED).build();System.out.println(doc.toJson(settings));  The output of this code example should look something like this: {\"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439012\"}, \"myNumber\": 11223344} \nUSING THE BSON LIBRARY \nYou can also output an Extended JSON string from data in Java objects using the BSON library with the JsonWriter class. To construct an instance of JsonWriter, pass a subclass of a Java Writer to specify how you want to output the Extended JSON. You can optionally pass a JsonWriterSettings instance to specify options such as the Extended JSON format. By default, the JsonWriter uses the Relaxed mode format. The MongoDB Java driver's document classes also use this class to convert BSON to Extended JSON. The following code example shows how you can use JsonWriter to create an Extended JSON string and output it to System.out. We specify the format by passing the outputMode() builder method the JsonMode.EXTENDED constant: JsonWriterSettings settings = JsonWriterSettings.builder().outputMode(JsonMode.EXTENDED).build();\ntry (JsonWriter jsonWriter = new JsonWriter(new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out)), settings)) {    jsonWriter.writeStartDocument();    jsonWriter.writeObjectId(\"_id\", new ObjectId(\"507f1f77bcf86cd799439012\"));    jsonWriter.writeInt64(\"myNumber\", 11223344);    jsonWriter.writeEndDocument();    jsonWriter.flush();}  The output of this code example should look something like this: {\"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439012\"}, \"myNumber\": {\"$numberLong\": \"11223344\"}} For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * JsonWriter  * JsonWriterSettings  * outputMode() \nCUSTOM BSON TYPE CONVERSION \nIn addition to specifying the outputMode() to format the JSON output, you can further customize the output by adding converters to your JsonWriterSettings.Builder. These converter methods detect the Java types and execute the logic defined by the Converter passed to them.

Example\n * Discriminators\n * Advanced Configuration\n * Abstract or Interface Types in Properties\n * POJOs without No-Argument Constructors\n * Serialization Customization \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to define custom data conversions between BSON and POJOs in the MongoDB Java driver. In our guide on POJOs, we show how to specify a PojoCodecProvider which contains classes that provide instructions on how to convert data for one or more POJO classes and their properties. We show how to specify your data conversion using the ClassModel and PropertyModel classes. You can also learn about more specific customization from the section on Advanced Configuration. We also show how to use helpers such as Conventions and Annotations to specify common serialization actions. See the section on Discriminators if you want to serialize multiple POJO classes to documents in the same collection. If you need to implement conditional serialization, or if you need to use enums, generics, interface types, or abstract types, see the section on Advanced Configuration. If you only need to use the predefined behavior to convert data between BSON and POJOs, you can use the automatic setting for the PojoCodecProvider shown in the Document Data Formats: POJOs guide. \nCUSTOMIZE A POJOCODECPROVIDER \nThis section shows you how to specify your data conversion logic and POJO classes with a PojoCodecProvider. The PojoCodecProvider is an implementation of the CodecProvider interface that specifies the Codecs to use in data conversion. Use this implementation when performing data conversion between BSON and POJOs. You can create a PojoCodecProvider instance using the PojoCodecProvider.builder() method. You can also chain methods to the builder to register any of the following:      * Individual POJO classes  * Package names that contain POJO classes  * Instances of ClassModel that describe conversion logic for a specific POJO class The following example shows how you can specify the POJOs in a package named \"org.example.pojos\" and add the PojoCodecProvider to a CodecRegistry: import org.bson.codecs.configuration.CodecProvider;import org.bson.codecs.configuration.CodecRegistry;import org.bson.codecs.pojo.PojoCodecProvider;\nimport static org.bson.codecs.configuration.CodecRegistries.fromRegistries;import static org.bson.codecs.configuration.CodecRegistries.fromProviders;import static com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings.getDefaultCodecRegistry;\nCodecProvider pojoCodecProvider = PojoCodecProvider.builder().register(\"org.example.pojos\").build();CodecRegistry pojoCodecRegistry = fromRegistries(getDefaultCodecRegistry(), fromProviders(pojoCodecProvider));\n// Call withCodecRegistry(pojoCodecRegistry) on an instance of MongoClient, MongoDatabase, or MongoCollection  For more information on this class, see the PojoCodecProvider.Builder API Documentation. \nCLASSMODEL \nA ClassModel instance stores data conversion information about a specific POJO class. It contains a list of PropertyModel instances which describe the property fields of the POJO, whether to convert fields, and optionally, Codecs to convert the fields.

For more information on this class, see the ClassModel API Documentation. To instantiate a ClassModel, use the ClassModel.builder() method and specify your POJO class. The builder uses reflection to create the required metadata. ClassModel<Flower> classModel = ClassModel.builder(Flower.class).build();  \nPROPERTYMODEL \nA PropertyModel stores information on how to serialize/deserialize a specific field in a document. The PropertyModel contains the following information: Field Name\nDescription\nName\nSpecifies the property name in the model.\nRead Name\nName of the property to use as the key when serializing to BSON.\nWrite Name\nName of the property to use as the key when deserializing from BSON.\nType data\nContains an instance of org.bson.codecs.pojo.TypeData that describes the data type for the field.\nCodec\nSpecifies a codec to use to encode or decode the field. Optional.\nSerialization checker\nDetermines whether to serialize a value by using the criteria specified in the checker.\nProperty accessor\nMethod used to access the value of the property from the POJO.\nuseDiscriminator\nSpecifies whether to use the discriminator.\nFor more information on discriminators, see the Discriminators section. To create a PropertyModel use a PropertyModelBuilder which you can instantiate by calling the PropertyModel.builder() method. For more information on this class, see the PropertyModel.Builder API Documentation. \nCONVENTIONS \nThe Convention interface contains configuration options that modify the behavior of a ClassModel or PropertyModel. You can specify a Convention in a call to PojoCodecProvider.Builder.conventions() or to ClassModelBuilder.conventions(). \nNOTE The builders apply Convention instances in order which may override behavior defined in one applied earlier. You can access the Convention instances defined in the BSON library from the following static fields in the Conventions class: Field Name\nDescription\nANNOTATION_CONVENTION\nEnables the annotations defined in the org.bson.codecs.pojo.annotations package for your POJO. See the section on Annotations for more information.\nCLASS_AND_PROPERTY_CONVENTION\nSets the following default values for the ClassModel and PropertyModel instances:\n- Discriminator key to _t\n- Discriminator value to the ClassModel simple type name\n- Id field to _id for each PropertyModel.\nDEFAULT_CONVENTIONS\nEnables the following Conventions:\n- CLASS_AND_PROPERTY_CONVENTION\n- ANNOTATION_CONVENTION\n- OBJECT_ID_GENERATORS\nNO_CONVENTIONS\nProvides an empty list.\nOBJECT_ID_GENERATORS\nAdds a default IdGenerator that adds a new ObjectId for each ClassModel that use ObjectId values in the id property.\nSET_PRIVATE_FIELDS_CONVENTION\nEnables the ClassModel to set private fields using reflection without requiring a setter method.\nUSE_GETTERS_FOR_SETTERS\nEnables use of getter methods as setters for Collection and Map fields if no setter method exists. You can specify Conventions using one of the following methods:  * PojoCodecProvider.Builder.conventions()  * ClassModelBuilder.conventions() To create a custom Convention, create a class that implements the Convention interface and override the apply() method from which you can access your ClassModelBuilder instance. \nANNOTATIONS \nYou can apply annotations to the getter and setter methods of a POJO class. These annotations configure the ClassModel and PropertyModel behavior for a specific field, method, or class.

Specifies the POJO field on which to deserialize all elements that are not mapped to a field. The POJO field must be one of the following types:  * Document  * BsonDocument  * Map<String, Object> \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: BsonExtraElements Annotation Example The following code snippet shows a sample POJO called Product that uses several of the preceding annotations. import org.bson.BsonType;import org.bson.codecs.pojo.annotations.BsonCreator;import org.bson.codecs.pojo.annotations.BsonDiscriminator;import org.bson.codecs.pojo.annotations.BsonId;import org.bson.codecs.pojo.annotations.BsonIgnore;import org.bson.codecs.pojo.annotations.BsonProperty;import org.bson.codecs.pojo.annotations.BsonRepresentation;\n@BsonDiscriminator(value=\"AnnotatedProduct\", key=\"_cls\")public class Product {    @BsonProperty(\"modelName\")    private String name;\n    @BsonId()    @BsonRepresentation(BsonType.OBJECT_ID)    private String serialNumber;\n    @BsonIgnore    private List<Product> relatedItems;\n    @BsonCreator    public Product(@BsonProperty(\"modelName\") String name) {        this.name = name;    }\n    // ...\n}  \nTIP When using annotations, remember to specify the Conventions.ANNOTATION_CONVENTION in your ClassModelBuilder or PojoCodecProvider.Builder. For example: ClassModel<Product> classModel = ClassModel.builder(Product.class).       conventions(Arrays.asList(Conventions.ANNOTATION_CONVENTION)).build();  The annotations in the example POJO specify the following behavior:  * Reference the POJO with the specified discriminator key and value, adding the cls field with the value of \"AnnotatedProduct\" to the BSON document on write operations  * Convert between the POJO name field and value and the BSON modelName field and value in the document  * Convert between the POJO serialNumber field and value the BSON document _id field and value in the document  * Omit the relatedItems field and value when converting data  * Use the Product(String name) constructor when instantiating the POJO \nBSONEXTRAELEMENTS EXAMPLE \nThe @BsonExtraElements annotation allows you to specify a field to deserialize data from a MongoDB document that lacks a corresponding POJO field mapping. This is useful when your application needs to work with data in a partially-defined schema. You can use this annotation to access data from any fields that do not correspond to the fields on your POJO. Consider a situation in which you store and retrieve data for an online store using the Product POJO from the previous example. As you offer a greater variety of products for the store, you discover that you need additional fields to describe them. Instead of mapping each additional field to the POJO, you can access them from a single field annotated with @BsonExtraElements as shown in the following code example: public class Product {    @BsonProperty(\"modelName\")    private String name;\n    @BsonId()    @BsonRepresentation(BsonType.OBJECT_ID)    private String serialNumber;\n    @BsonIgnore    private List<Product> relatedItems;\n    @BsonExtraElements    private Document additionalInfo;\n    // ...  Suppose someone added additional fields for dimensions and weight to the product data such that the documents contained the following information: {  \"name\": \"MDB0123\",  \"serialNumber\": \"62e2...\",  \"dimensions\": \"3x4x5\",  \"weight\": \"256g\"} The preceding document retrieved using the Product POJO contains the following data: ProductWithBsonExtraElements [  name=MDB0123,

Use discriminators to instruct the CodecProvider which object class to use when deserializing to different object classes from the same collection. When serializing the POJO to a MongoDB collection, the associated codec sets the discriminator key-value field, unless otherwise specified in the POJO property data. You can set and enable a discriminator in a POJO by performing one of the following:  * Use the @BsonDiscriminator annotation to specify the discriminator for the POJO class  * Call enableDiscriminator(true) on the ClassModelBuilder associated with the POJO class See the following example POJO classes that contain @BsonDiscriminator annotations and example documents that contain the discriminator fields: @BsonDiscriminator(value=\"AnonymousUser\", key=\"_cls\")public class AnonymousUser {    // class code}\n@BsonDiscriminator(value=\"RegisteredUser\", key=\"_cls\")public class RegisteredUser {    // class code}  The following shows sample documents created from the preceding POJOs in a single MongoDB collection: { \"_cls\": \"AnonymousUser\", \"_id\": ObjectId(\"<Object ID>\"),  ... }{ \"_cls\": \"RegisteredUser\", \"_id\": ObjectId(\"<Object ID>\"), ... } \nADVANCED CONFIGURATION  ABSTRACT OR INTERFACE TYPES IN PROPERTIES \nTo serialize a POJO that includes abstract class or interface type properties, you must specify discriminators on the type and all its subtypes or implementations. Suppose you defined a POJO that referenced an abstract class User in one of its fields as follows: public class UserRecordPojo {     private User user;     // ...}  If the User abstract class has subclasses FreeUser and SubscriberUser, you can add your POJO and abstract classes to your CodecRegistry as follows: ClassModel<UserRecordPojo> userRecordPojo = ClassModel.builder(UserRecordPojo.class).enableDiscriminator(true).build();ClassModel<User> userModel = ClassModel.builder(User.class).enableDiscriminator(true).build();ClassModel<FreeUser> freeUserModel = ClassModel.builder(FreeUser.class).enableDiscriminator(true).build();ClassModel<SubscriberUser> subscriberUserModel = ClassModel.builder(SubscriberUser.class).enableDiscriminator(true).build();\nPojoCodecProvider pojoCodecProvider = PojoCodecProvider.builder().register(userRecordPojo, userModel, freeUserModel, subscriberUserModel).build();\nCodecRegistry pojoCodecRegistry = fromRegistries(getDefaultCodecRegistry(), fromProviders(pojoCodecProvider));  For more information on specifying discriminators, see the section of this guide on Discriminators. \nPOJOS WITHOUT NO-ARGUMENT CONSTRUCTORS \nThe POJO Codecs default to calling the empty, no-argument constructor. To specify a different constructor, you must perform the following in your POJO:  * pass the ANNOTATION_CONVENTION setting to your ClassModelBuilder  * identify the constructor using the BsonCreator annotation For an example of setting the ANNOTATION_CONVENTION, see the ANNOTATION_CONVENTION example. For an example of the BsonCreator annotation, see the POJO with annotation code example. \nSERIALIZATION CUSTOMIZATION \nBy default, ClassModelBuilder attempts to serialize all the non-null properties in your POJO. If a property value is null, the default PropertySerialization implementation skips that field. You can customize your POJO serialization behavior by performing one of the following:  * Use the @BsonIgnore annotation for a property to always skip serialization. Make sure to enable annotations using the appropriate Conventions.  * Create a custom class that overrides the shouldSerialize() method of the PropertySerialization interface. Specify your custom implementation to the PropertyModelBuilder which is accessible from the ClassModelBuilder. For more information on how to use the @BsonIgnore annotation in a POJO, see the section of this guide on Annotations. The following sample code shows a custom class that implements the PropertySerialization interface to override the default conditions by which to determine whether to serialize a field: public class

public class BirthdayInvitation {    private String name;    private Integer age;    private LocalDateTime eventDateTime;\n    // ...}  You can specify the custom serialization by adding the CourteousAgeSerialization instance to the PropertyModelBuilder from the ClassModel property associated with the age field using the following code: ClassModelBuilder<BirthdayInvitation> classModel = ClassModel.builder(BirthdayInvitation.class);((PropertyModelBuilder<Integer>) classModel.getProperty(\"age\"))        .propertySerialization(new CourteousAgeSerialization());\nPojoCodecProvider pojoCodecProvider = PojoCodecProvider.builder().register(classModel.build()).build();CodecRegistry pojoCodecRegistry = fromRegistries(getDefaultCodecRegistry(), fromProviders(pojoCodecProvider));  If you insert a POJO that contains a value greater than 29 in the age field, the serialized document omits it. The POJO declaration and resulting document could look something like this: // constructor with parameters for name, age, and eventDateTime, respectivelyBirthdayInvitation invitation = new BirthdayInvitation(        \"Galadriel\",        7582,        LocalDateTime.of(2021, Month.JANUARY, 18, 30, 0)    );  Since the age field value is greater than 29, the serialized document should look something like this: { \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"...\"), \"eventDateTime\" : ..., \"name\" : \"Galadriel\" } GENERICS SUPPORT \nYou can use the POJO Codec to serialize classes that contain generic properties if they meet the following criteria:  * Contain only bounded concrete type parameters  * If it or any of its fields are part of a class hierarchy, the top-level POJO does not contain any type parameters The ClassModelBuilder inspects and saves concrete type parameters to work around type erasure. It cannot serialize classes that contain generic properties without concrete type parameters since the JVM removes the type parameter information. To save type parameters, you can implement the PropertyCodecProvider interface to specify them for generic types defined in a POJO. The following code snippets show an example implementation of the PropertyCodecProvider that adds serialization compatibility to the Guava Optional class. Suppose you wanted to serialize the following POJO with Optional fields: public class ApplicationUser {    private Optional<Address> optionalAddress;    private Optional<Subscription> optionalSubscription;\n    // ...}  You can use the following implementation of PropertyCodecProvider to retrieve your custom Codec.

Store\n * Configure a Client-Specific Trust Store and Key Store\n * Disable Hostname Verification\n * Restrict Connections to TLS 1.2 Only\n * Customize TLS/SSL Configuration through the Java SE SSLContext\n * Customize TLS/SSL Configuration through the Netty SslContext\n * Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)\n * Client-Driven OCSP\n * OCSP Stapling \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to connect to MongoDB instances with the TLS/SSL security protocol using the underlying TLS/SSL support in the JDK. To configure your connection to use TLS/SSL, enable the TLS/SSL settings in either the ConnectionString or MongoClientSettings. \nNOTE \nDEBUGGING TLS/SSL If you experience trouble setting up your TLS/SSL connection, you can use the -Djavax.net.debug=all system property to view additional log statements. See the Oracle guide to debugging TLS/SSL connections for more information. \nENABLE TLS/SSL \nYou can enable TLS/SSL for the connection to your MongoDB instance in two different ways: through a parameter in your connection string, or using a method in the MongoClientSettings.Builder class.   CONFIGURE CERTIFICATES \nJava applications that initiate TLS/SSL requests require access to cryptographic certificates that prove identity for the application itself as well as other applications with which the application interacts. You can configure access to these certificates in your application with the following mechanisms:      * The JVM Trust Store and JVM Key Store  * A Client-Specific Trust Store and Key Store \nNOTE The following sections are based on the documentation for Oracle JDK, so some parts may be inapplicable to your JDK or to the custom TLS/SSL implementation you use. \nCONFIGURE THE JVM TRUST STORE  NOTE By default, the JRE includes many commonly used public certificates from signing authorities like Let's Encrypt. As a result, you can connect to instances of MongoDB Atlas (or any other server whose certificate is signed by an authority in the JRE's default certificate store) with TLS/SSL without configuring the trust store. The JVM trust store saves certificates that securely identify other applications with which your Java application interacts. Using these certificates, your application can prove that the connection to another application is genuine and secure from tampering by third parties. If your MongoDB instance uses a certificate that is signed by an authority that is not present in the JRE's default certificate store, your application must configure two system properties to initiate SSL/TLS requests. These properties ensure that your application is able to validate the TLS/SSL certificate presented by a connected MongoDB instance.  * javax.net.ssl.trustStore: the path to a trust store containing the certificate of the signing authority  * javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword: the password to access the trust store defined in javax.net.ssl.trustStore You can create a trust store with the keytool command line tool provided as part of the JDK: keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -file <path to certificate authority file>         -keystore <path to trust store> -storepass <password>  \nCONFIGURE THE JVM KEY STORE  NOTE By default, MongoDB instances do not perform client certificate validation. You only need to configure the key store if you explicitly configured your MongoDB instance to validate client certificates. The JVM key store saves certificates that securely identify your Java application to other applications. Using these certificates, other applications can prove that the connection to your application is genuine and secure from tampering by third parties. An application that initiates TLS/SSL requests needs to set two JVM system properties to ensure that the client presents a TLS/SSL certificate to the MongoDB server:  * javax.net.ssl.keyStore: the path to a key store containing the client's TLS/SSL certificates  * javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword: the password to access the key store defined in javax.net.ssl.keyStore You can create a key store with the keytool or openssl command line tools. For more information on configuring a Java application to use TLS/SSL, please refer to the JSSE Reference Guide. \nCONFIGURE A CLIENT-SPECIFIC TRUST STORE AND KEY STORE \nYou can configure a

For more information on the SSLContext class, see the API documentation for SSL Context. \nDISABLE HOSTNAME VERIFICATION \nBy default, the driver ensures that the hostname included in the server's TLS/SSL certificates matches the hostnames provided when constructing a MongoClient. If you need to disable hostname verification for your application, you can explicitly disable this by setting the invalidHostNameAllowed property of the builder to true in the applytoSslSettings() builder lambda: MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()     .applyToSslSettings(builder -> {                 builder.enabled(true);                 builder.invalidHostNameAllowed(true);             })     .build();  \nWARNING Disabling hostname verification can make your configuration insecure. You should only disable hostname verification for testing purposes or when there is no other alternative. \nRESTRICT CONNECTIONS TO TLS 1.2 ONLY \nTo restrict your application to use only the TLS 1.2 protocol, set the jdk.tls.client.protocols system property to \"TLSv1.2\". \nNOTE Java Runtime Environments (JREs) prior to Java 8 only enabled the TLS 1.2 protocol in update releases. If your JRE has not enabled the TLS 1.2 protocol, you may need to upgrade to a later release to connect using TLS 1.2. \nCUSTOMIZE TLS/SSL CONFIGURATION THROUGH THE JAVA SE SSLCONTEXT \nIf your TLS/SSL configuration requires additional customization, you can set the sslContext property of your MongoClient by passing an SSLContext object to the builder in the applyToSslSettings() lambda: SSLContext sslContext = ...MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()     .applyToSslSettings(builder -> {                 builder.enabled(true);                 builder.context(sslContext);             })     .build();MongoClient client = MongoClients.create(settings);  \nCUSTOMIZE TLS/SSL CONFIGURATION THROUGH THE NETTY SSLCONTEXT \nIf you use the driver with Netty for network IO, you have an option to plug an alternative TLS/SSL protocol implementation provided by Netty. import com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings;import com.mongodb.client.MongoClients;import com.mongodb.client.MongoClient;import com.mongodb.connection.netty.NettyStreamFactoryFactory;import io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext;import io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContextBuilder;import io.netty.handler.ssl.SslProvider;  \nNOTE The driver tests with Netty version io.netty:netty-all:4.1.79.Final To instruct the driver to use io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext, use the NettyStreamFactoryFactory.Builder.sslContext method. See the method documentation for details about the different io.netty.handler.ssl.SslProvider variants the driver supports and the implications of using them. SslContext sslContext = SslContextBuilder.forClient()        .sslProvider(SslProvider.OPENSSL)        .build();MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()        .applyToSslSettings(builder -> builder.enabled(true))        .streamFactoryFactory(NettyStreamFactoryFactory.builder()                .sslContext(sslContext)                .build())

Docs Home → Java Sync \nCONNECT TO MONGODB \nIn this guide, you can learn how to connect to a MongoDB instance or replica set using the Java driver. You can view sample code to connect to an Atlas cluster or continue reading to learn more about the MongoClient class and connection URIs. \nMONGOCLIENT \nYou can connect to and communicate with MongoDB using the MongoClient class. Use the MongoClients.create() method to construct a MongoClient. As each MongoClient represents a thread-safe pool of connections to the database, most applications only require a single instance of a MongoClient, even across multiple threads. All resource usage limits, such as max connections, apply to individual MongoClient instances. To learn about the different settings you can use to control the behavior of your MongoClient, see the guide on MongoClient Settings. \nTIP Always call MongoClient.close() to clean up resources when an instance is no longer needed. \nCONNECTION URI \nThe connection URI provides a set of instructions that the driver uses to connect to a MongoDB deployment. It instructs the driver on how it should connect to MongoDB and how it should behave while connected. The following figure explains each part of a sample connection URI:  This figure uses the Standard Connection String Format, mongodb for the protocol. You can also use the DNS Seed List Connection Format, mongodb+srv, if you want more flexibility of deployment and the ability to change the servers in rotation without reconfiguring clients. \nNOTE If your deployment is on MongoDB Atlas, see the Atlas driver connection guide and select Java from the language dropdown to retrieve your connection string. The next part of the connection URI contains your credentials if you are using a password-based authentication mechanism. Replace the value of user with your username and pass with your password. If your authentication mechanism does not require credentials, omit this part of the connection URI. The next part of the connection URI specifies the hostname or IP address, followed by the port of your MongoDB instance. In the example, sample.host represents the hostname and 27017 is the port number. Replace these values to refer to your MongoDB instance. The last part of the connection URI contains connection options as parameters. In the example, we set two connection options: maxPoolSize=20 and w=majority. For more information on connection options, skip to the Connection Options section of this guide. \nATLAS CONNECTION EXAMPLE \nTo connect to a MongoDB deployment on Atlas, create a client. You can create a client that uses your connection string and other client options by passing a MongoClientSettings object to the MongoClients.create() method. To instantiate a MongoClientSettings object, use the builder method to specify your connection string and any other client options, and then call the build() method. Chain the applyConnectionString() method to the builder to specify your connection URI.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nCONNECTION OPTIONS \nThis section explains MongoDB connection and authentication options supported by the driver. You can pass the connection options as parameters of the connection URI to specify the behavior of the client. Option Name\nType\nDescription\nminPoolSize\ninteger Specifies the minimum number of connections that must exist at any moment in a single connection pool. Default: 0\nmaxPoolSize\ninteger Specifies the maximum number of connections that a connection pool may have at a given time. Default: 100\nwaitQueueTimeoutMS\ninteger Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds that a thread may wait for a connection to become available. Default: 120000 (120 seconds)\nserverSelectionTimeoutMS\ninteger Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the driver will wait for server selection to succeed before throwing an exception. Default: 30000 (30 seconds)\nlocalThresholdMS\ninteger When communicating with multiple instances of MongoDB in a replica set, the driver will only send requests to a server whose response time is less than or equal to the server with the fastest response time plus the local threshold, in milliseconds. Default: 15\nheartbeatFrequencyMS\ninteger Specifies the frequency, in milliseconds that the driver will wait between attempts to determine the current state of each server in the cluster. Default: 10000 (10 seconds)\nreplicaSet\nstring Specifies that the connection string provided includes multiple hosts. When specified, the driver attempts to find all members of that set. Default: null\nssl\nboolean Specifies that all communication with MongoDB instances should use TLS/SSL. Superseded by the tls option. Default: false\ntls\nboolean Specifies that all communication with MongoDB instances should use TLS. Supersedes the ssl option. Default: false\ntlsInsecure\nboolean Specifies that the driver should allow invalid hostnames for TLS connections. Has the same effect as setting tlsAllowInvalidHostnames to true. To configure TLS security constraints in other ways, use a custom SSLContext. Default: false\ntlsAllowInvalidHostnames\nboolean Specifies that the driver should allow invalid hostnames in the certificate for TLS connections. Supersedes sslInvalidHostNameAllowed. Default: false\nconnectTimeoutMS\ninteger Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the Java driver waits for a connection to open before timing out. A value of 0 instructs the driver to never time out while waiting for a connection to open. Default: 10000 (10 seconds)\nsocketTimeoutMS\ninteger Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the Java driver will wait to send or receive a request before timing out. A value of 0 instructs the driver to never time out while waiting to send or receive a request. Default: 0\nmaxIdleTimeMS\ninteger Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the Java driver will allow a pooled connection to idle before closing the connection. A value of 0 indicates that there is no upper bound on how long the driver can allow a pooled collection to be idle. Default: 0\nmaxLifeTimeMS\ninteger Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the Java driver will continue to use a pooled connection before closing the connection. A value of 0 indicates that there is no upper bound on how long the driver can keep a pooled connection open. Default: 0\njournal\nboolean Specifies that the driver must wait for the connected MongoDB instance to group commit to the journal file on disk for all writes. Default: false\nw\nstring or integer Specifies the write concern. For more information on values, see the server documentation for the w option. Default: 1\nwtimeoutMS\ninteger Specifies a time limit, in milliseconds, for the write concern. For more information, see the server documentation for the wtimeoutMS option. A value of 0 instructs the driver to never time out write operations. Default: 0\nreadPreference\nstring Specifies the read preference. For more information on values, see the server documentation for the readPreference option. Default: primary\nreadPreferenceTags\nstring Specifies the read preference tags. For more information on values, see the server documentation for the readPreferenceTags option. Default: null\nmaxStalenessSeconds\ninteger Specifies, in seconds, how stale a secondary can be before the driver stops communicating with that secondary. The minimum value is either 90 seconds or the heartbeat frequency plus 10 seconds, whichever is greater. For more information, see the server documentation for the maxStalenessSeconds option. Not providing a parameter or explicitly specifying -1 indicates that there should be no staleness check for secondaries.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nINDEXES BUILDERS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Ascending Indexes\n * Descending Indexes\n * Compound Indexes\n * Text Indexes\n * Hashed Indexes\n * Geospatial Indexes \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to specify indexes using builders in the MongoDB Java driver. The Indexes builder provides helper methods for constructing the following types of indexes:      * Ascending Indexes  * Descending Indexes  * Compound Indexes  * Text Indexes  * Hashed Indexes  * Geospatial Indexes Indexes store a subset of the collection’s data set. The index stores the value of a specific field or set of fields, ordered by the value of the field. See our guide on Indexes for examples of queries covered by indexes. The Indexes class provides static factory methods for all the MongoDB index types. Each method returns a BSON instance, which you can pass to createIndex(). \nTIP For brevity, you may choose to import all methods of the Indexes class statically: import static com.mongodb.client.model.Indexes.*;  The following examples assume this static import. \nASCENDING INDEXES \nAn ascending index enables you to sort query results by the value of the indexed fields from smallest to largest. In order to create an ascending index, first call the ascending() builder method to create a Bson instance that represents the index document, passing the name or names of the fields you want to index. Then, call the createIndex() method on the collection, passing the Bson instance that contains the index document. \nNOTE If you have an ascending or a descending index on a single field, MongoDB can sort using the index in either direction. The following example specifies an ascending index on the name field: Bson ascendingIndex = ascending(\"name\");collection.createIndex(ascendingIndex);  \nDESCENDING INDEXES \nA descending index enables you to sort query results by the value of the indexed fields from largest to smallest. In order to create a descending index, first call the descending() builder method to create a Bson instance that represents the index document, passing the name or names of the fields you want to index. Then, call the createIndex() method on the collection, passing the Bson instance that contains the index document. The following example specifies a descending index on the capacity field: Bson descendingIndex = descending(\"capacity\");collection.createIndex(descendingIndex);  \nCOMPOUND INDEXES \nIn order to create a compound index, first call the compoundIndex() builder method to create a Bson instance that represents the index document, passing the names of the fields you want to index. Then, call the createIndex() method on the collection, passing the Bson instance that contains the index document. The following example specifies a compound index composed of descending index on the capacity and year field, followed by an ascending index on the name field: Bson compoundIndexExample = compoundIndex(descending(\"capacity\", \"year\"), ascending(\"name\"));collection.createIndex(compoundIndexExample);  \nTEXT INDEXES \nA text index groups documents by the text in the indexed field. In order to create a text index, first call the text() builder method to create a Bson instance that represents the index document, passing the name of the fields you want to index. Then, call the createIndex() method on the collection, passing the Bson instance that contains the index document. The following example specifies a text index key on the \"theaters\" field: Bson textIndex = text(\"theaters\");collection.createIndex(textIndex);  \nHASHED INDEXES \nA hashed index groups documents by the hash value in the indexed field. In order to create a hashed index, first call the hashed() builder method to create a Bson instance that represents the index document, passing the name of the fields you want to index. Then, call the createIndex() method on the collection, passing the Bson instance that contains the index document. The following example specifies a hashed index on the capacity field: Bson hashedIndex = hashed(\"capacity\");collection.createIndex(hashedIndex);  \nGEOSPATIAL INDEXES \nA 2dsphere index groups documents by the coordinates in the indexed field. In order to create a 2dsphere index, first call the geo2dsphere() builder method to create a Bson instance that represents the index document, passing the name or names of the fields you want to index.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nSORTS BUILDERS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * The Sorts Class\n * Ascending\n * Descending\n * Combining Sort Criteria\n * Text Score \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to specify sort criteria for your queries using builders in the MongoDB Java driver. Sort criteria are the rules MongoDB uses to sort your data. Some examples of sort criteria are:      * Smallest number to largest number  * Earliest time of day to latest time of day  * Alphabetical order by first name Builders are classes provided by the MongoDB Java driver that help you construct BSON objects. To learn more, see our guide on builders. You should read this guide if you would like to use builders to specify sort criteria for your queries. If you want to learn the fundamentals of sorting in the MongoDB Java driver, consider reading our guide on sorting. The examples on this page use a sample collection that contains the following documents: {\"_id\": 1, \"letter\": \"c\", \"food\": \"coffee with milk\"}{\"_id\": 3, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"maple syrup\"}{\"_id\": 4, \"letter\": \"b\", \"food\": \"coffee with sugar\"}{\"_id\": 5, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"milk and cookies\"}{\"_id\": 2, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"donuts and coffee\"}{\"_id\": 6, \"letter\": \"c\", \"food\": \"maple donut\"}  \nTHE SORTS CLASS \nThe Sorts class is a builder that provides static factory methods for all sort criteria operators supported by MongoDB. These methods return a Bson object that you can pass to the sort() method of a FindIterable instance or to Aggregates.sort(). If you want to learn more about the Aggregates class, see our guide on the Aggregates builder. For more information about the classes and interfaces in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * Sorts  * BSON  * FindIterable  * Aggregates \nASCENDING \nTo specify an ascending sort, use the Sorts.ascending() static factory method. Pass Sorts.ascending() the name of the field you need to sort on. The following example sorts the documents in the sample collection by ascending order on the _id field: import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.ascending;\n// <MongoCollection setup code here>\ncollection.find().sort(ascending(\"_id\"));  The output of the preceding example should look something like this: {\"_id\": 1, \"letter\": \"c\", \"food\": \"coffee with milk\"}{\"_id\": 2, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"donuts and coffee\"}{\"_id\": 3, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"maple syrup\"}... \nDESCENDING \nTo specify a descending sort, use the Sorts.descending() static factory method. Pass Sorts.descending() the name of the field you need to sort on. The following example sorts the documents in the sample collection in descending order on the _id field: import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.descending;\n// <MongoCollection setup code here>\ncollection.find().sort(descending(\"_id\"));  The preceding example should output something like this: {\"_id\": 6, \"letter\": \"c\", \"food\": \"maple donut\"}{\"_id\": 5, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"milk and cookies\"}{\"_id\": 4, \"letter\": \"b\", \"food\": \"coffee with sugar\"}... \nCOMBINING SORT CRITERIA \nTo combine sort criteria, use the Sorts.orderBy() static factory method. This method constructs an object containing an ordered list of sort criteria. When performing the sort, if the leftmost sort criteria results in a tie, the sort uses the next sort criteria in the list to determine the order.

Exclusion of _id\n * Project an Array Element Match\n * Project an Array Slice\n * Project a Text Score \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to specify projections using builders in the MongoDB Java driver. MongoDB supports field projection, specifying which fields to include and exclude when returning results from a query. Projection in MongoDB follows some basic rules:      * The _id field is always included unless explicitly excluded  * Specifying a field for inclusion implicitly excludes all other fields except the _id field  * Specifying a field for exclusion removes only that field in a query result Find more information about projection mechanics here. The Projections class provides static factory methods for all the MongoDB projection operators. Each method returns an instance of the BSON type which you can pass to any method that expects a projection. \nTIP For brevity, you may choose to import the methods of the Projections class statically: import static com.mongodb.client.model.Projections.*;  The following examples assume this static import. \nSAMPLE DOCUMENTS AND EXAMPLES \nThe following sections feature examples that run query and projection operations on a sample collection called projection_builders. Each section uses a variable named collection to refer to the MongoCollection instance of the projection_builders collection. The collection contains the following documents, representing the monthly average temperatures in Celsius for the years 2018 and 2019: {  \"year\" : 2018,  \"type\" : \"even number but not a leap year\",  \"temperatures\" : [    { \"month\" : \"January\", \"avg\" : 9.765 },    { \"month\" : \"February\", \"avg\" : 9.675 },    { \"month\" : \"March\", \"avg\" : 10.004 },    { \"month\" : \"April\", \"avg\" : 9.983 },    { \"month\" : \"May\", \"avg\" : 9.747 },    { \"month\" : \"June\", \"avg\" : 9.65 },    { \"month\" : \"July\", \"avg\" : 9.786 },    { \"month\" : \"August\", \"avg\" : 9.617 },    { \"month\" : \"September\", \"avg\" : 9.51 },    { \"month\" : \"October\", \"avg\" : 10.042 },    { \"month\" : \"November\", \"avg\" : 9.452 },    { \"month\" : \"December\", \"avg\" : 9.86 }  ]},{  \"year\" : 2019,  \"type\" : \"odd number, can't be a leap year\",  \"temperatures\" : [    { \"month\" : \"January\", \"avg\" : 10.023 },    { \"month\" : \"February\", \"avg\" : 9.808 },    { \"month\" : \"March\", \"avg\" : 10.43 },    { \"month\" : \"April\", \"avg\" : 10.175 },    { \"month\" : \"May\", \"avg\" : 9.648 },    { \"month\" : \"June\", \"avg\" : 9.686 },    { \"month\" : \"July\", \"avg\" : 9.794 },    { \"month\" : \"August\", \"avg\" : 9.741 },    { \"month\" : \"September\", \"avg\" : 9.84 },    { \"month\" : \"October\", \"avg\" : 10.15 },    { \"month\" : \"November\", \"avg\" : 9.84 },    { \"month\" : \"December\", \"avg\" : 10.366 }  ]}  \nPROJECTION OPERATIONS \nThe following sections contain information on the available projection operations and how to construct them using the Projections class. \nINCLUSION \nUse the include() method to specify the inclusion of one or more fields.

The following example excludes the temperatures field: Bson filter = Filters.empty();Bson projection = exclude(\"temperatures\");collection.find(filter).projection(projection).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));  The following code shows the output from this projection: {\"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"6042edc9f2b56342164e0790\"}, \"year\": 2018, \"type\": \"even number but not a leap year\"}{\"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"6042edc9f2b56342164e0791\"}, \"year\": 2019, \"type\": \"odd number, can't be a leap year\"} The following example excludes the type and temperatures fields: Bson filter = Filters.empty();Bson projection = exclude(\"temperatures\", \"type\");collection.find(filter).projection(projection).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));  The following code shows the output from this projection: {\"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"6042edc9f2b56342164e0790\"}, \"year\": 2018}{\"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"6042edc9f2b56342164e0791\"}, \"year\": 2019} \nCOMBINING PROJECTIONS \nUse the fields() method to combine multiple projections. The following example includes the year and type fields and excludes the _id field: Bson filter = Filters.empty();Bson projection = fields(include(\"year\", \"type\"), exclude(\"_id\"));collection.find(filter).projection(projection).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));  The following code shows the output from this projection: {\"year\": 2018, \"type\": \"even number but not a leap year\"}{\"year\": 2019, \"type\": \"odd number, can't be a leap year\"} \nEXCLUSION OF _ID \nUse the excludeId() convenience method to specify the exclusion of the _id field: Bson filter = Filters.empty();Bson projection = fields(include(\"year\", \"type\"), excludeId());collection.find(filter).projection(projection).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));  The following code shows the output from this projection: {\"year\": 2018, \"type\": \"even number but not a leap year\"}{\"year\": 2019, \"type\": \"odd number, can't be a leap year\"} \nPROJECT AN ARRAY ELEMENT MATCH \nUse the elemMatch(String, Bson) method variant to specify an array projection that will include the first element of an array that matches a supplied query filter. This filtering occurs after all documents matching the query filter (if supplied) are retrieved. \nNOTE Only the first element that matches the specified query filter will be included, regardless of how many matches there may be. The following example projects the first element of the temperatures array where the avg field is greater that 10.1: Bson filter = Filters.empty();Bson projection = fields(include(\"year\"),

When you've specified matching criteria in the query portion of your operation, use the elemMatch(String) method variant to specify a positional projection to include the first element of an array. Only documents that match the query filter will be retrieved. \nIMPORTANT In MongoDB versions < 4.4, the specified array field must appear in the query filter. Beginning in MongoDB 4.4, you can use a positional project on an array field that does not appear in the query filter. The following example projects the first element of the temperatures array: Bson filter = Filters.gt(\"temperatures.avg\", 10.1);Bson projection = fields(include(\"year\"), elemMatch(\"temperatures\"));collection.find(filter).projection(projection).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));  The following code shows the output from this projection: {\"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"6042edc9f2b56342164e0791\"}, \"year\": 2019, \"temperatures\": [{\"month\": \"March\", \"avg\": 10.43}]} \nPROJECT AN ARRAY SLICE \nUse the slice() method to project a slice of an array. The following example projects the first 6 elements of the temperatures array: Bson filter = Filters.empty();// first half of the yearBson projection = slice(\"temperatures\", 6);collection.find(filter).projection(projection)        .forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson(JsonWriterSettings.builder().indent(true).build())));  The following code shows the output from this projection: {  \"_id\": {    \"$oid\": \"6042f1bc8ee6fa2a84d2be69\"  },  \"year\": 2018,  \"type\": \"even number but not a leap year\",  \"temperatures\": [      ... <January-June temperature

Docs Home → Java Sync \nFILTERS BUILDERS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Comparison\n * Logical\n * Arrays\n * Elements\n * Evaluation\n * Bitwise\n * Geospatial \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use builders to specify filters for your queries in the MongoDB Java driver. Builders are classes provided by the MongoDB Java driver that help you construct BSON objects. To learn more, see our guide on builders. Filters are the operations MongoDB uses to limit your results to what you want to see. Some places we use filters are:      * find()  * match stage of aggregation  * deleteOne()/deleteMany()  * updateOne()/updateMany() Some examples of results from queries with filters are:  * Items that cost $0 to $25  * A hotel with amenities that include an indoor swimming pool and free parking  * A food critic review that mentions \"spicy\" This guide shows you how to use builders with examples of the following types of operators:  * Comparison  * Logical  * Arrays  * Elements  * Evaluation  * Bitwise  * Geospatial The Filters class provides static factory methods for all the MongoDB query operators. Each method returns an instance of the BSON type, which you can pass to any method that expects a query filter. \nTIP For brevity, you may choose to import all methods of the Filters class statically: import static com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.*;  The following examples assume this static import. The Filter examples in this guide use the following sample collections: Collection: paint_purchases { \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"red\", \"qty\": 5, \"vendor\": [\"A\"] }{ \"_id\": 2, \"color\": \"purple\", \"qty\": 10, \"vendor\": [\"C\", \"D\"] }{ \"_id\": 3, \"color\": \"blue\", \"qty\": 8, \"vendor\": [\"B\", \"A\"] }{ \"_id\": 4, \"color\": \"white\", \"qty\": 6, \"vendor\": [\"D\"] }{ \"_id\": 5, \"color\": \"yellow\", \"qty\": 11, \"vendor\": [\"A\", \"B\"] }{ \"_id\": 6, \"color\": \"pink\", \"qty\": 5, \"vendor\": [\"C\"] }{ \"_id\": 7, \"color\": \"green\", \"qty\": 8,\"vendor\": [\"B\", \"C\"] }{ \"_id\": 8, \"color\": \"orange\", \"qty\": 7, \"vendor\": [\"A\", \"D\"] }  Collection: binary_numbers { \"_id\": 9, \"a\": 54, \"binaryValue\": \"00110110\" }{ \"_id\": 10, \"a\": 20, \"binaryValue\": \"00010100\" }{ \"_id\": 11, \"a\": 68, \"binaryValue\": \"1000100\" }{ \"_id\": 12, \"a\": 102, \"binaryValue\": \"01100110\" }  Collection: geo_points { \"_id\": 13, \"coordinates\": { \"type\": \"Point\", \"coordinates\": [2.0, 2.0] } }{ \"_id\": 14, \"coordinates\": { \"type\": \"Point\", \"coordinates\": [5.0, 6.0] } }{ \"_id\": 15, \"coordinates\": { \"type\": \"Point\", \"coordinates\": [1.0, 3.0] } }{ \"_id\": 16, \"coordinates\": { \"type\": \"Point\", \"coordinates\": [4.0, 7.0] } }  \nCOMPARISON \nThe comparison filters include all operators that compare the value in a document to a specified value. The comparison operator methods include: Comparison Method\nMatches\neq()\nvalues equal to a specified value.\ngt()\nvalues greater than a specified value.\ngte()\nvalues greater than or equal to a specified value.\nlt()\nvalues less than a specified value.\nlte()\nvalues less than or equal to a specified value.\nne()\nvalues not equal to a specified value.\nin()\nany of the values specified in an array.\nnin()\nnone of the values specified in an array.\nempty()\nall the documents.

The following example creates a filter that matches documents where the value of the qty field is greater than \"8\" or the value of the color field equals \"pink\" in the paint_purchases collection: Bson orComparison = or(gt(\"qty\", 8), eq(\"color\", \"pink\"));collection.find(orComparison).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));  The following shows the output of the preceding query: { \"_id\": 2, \"color\": \"purple\", \"qty\": 10, \"vendor\": [\"C\", \"D\"] }{ \"_id\": 5, \"color\": \"yellow\", \"qty\": 11, \"vendor\": [\"A\", \"B\"] }{ \"_id\": 6, \"color\": \"pink\", \"qty\": 5, \"vendor\": [\"C\"] } \nARRAYS \nThe array operators evaluate the array field in a document. The array operator methods include: Array Method\nMatches\nall()\ndocuments if the array field contains every element specified in the query.\nelemMatch()\ndocuments if an element in the array field matches all the specified conditions.\nsize()\ndocuments if the array field is a specified number of elements. The following example matches documents with a vendors array containing both \"A\" and \"D\" in the paint_purchases collection: List<String> search = Arrays.asList(\"A\", \"D\");Bson allComparison = all(\"vendor\", search);collection.find(allComparison).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));  The following shows the output of the preceding query: { \"_id\": 8, \"color\": \"orange\", \"qty\": 7, \"vendor\": [\"A\", \"D\"] } \nELEMENTS \nThe elements operators evaluate the nature of a specified field. The elements operator methods include: Elements Method\nMatches\nexists()\ndocuments that have the specified field.\ntype()\ndocuments if a field is of the specified type.

The following example matches documents that have a bitField field with bits set at positions of the corresponding bitmask \"34\" (i.e. \"00100010\") in the binary_numbers collection: Bson bitsComparison = bitsAllSet(\"a\", 34);collection.find(bitsComparison).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));  The following shows the output of the preceding query: { \"_id\": 9, \"a\": 54, \"binaryValue\": \"00110110\" }{ \"_id\": 12, \"a\": 102, \"binaryValue\": \"01100110\" } \nGEOSPATIAL \nThe geospatial operators evaluate a specified coordinate and its relation to a shape or location. The geospatial operator methods include: Geospatial Method\nMatches\ngeoWithin()\ndocuments containing a GeoJSON geometry value that falls within a bounding GeoJSON geometry.\ngeoWithinBox()\ndocuments containing a coordinates value that exist within the specified box.\ngeoWithinPolygon()\ndocuments containing a coordinates value that exist within the specified polygon.\ngeoWithinCenter()\ndocuments containing a coordinates value that exist within the specified circle.\ngeoWithinCenterSphere()\ngeometries containing a geospatial data value (GeoJSON or legacy coordinate pairs) that exist within the specified circle, using spherical geometry.\ngeoIntersects()\ngeometries that intersect with a GeoJSON geometry. The 2dsphere index supports $geoIntersects.\nnear()\ngeospatial objects in proximity to a point. Requires a geospatial index. The 2dsphere and 2d indexes support $near.\nnearSphere()\ngeospatial objects in proximity to a point on a sphere. Requires a geospatial index. The 2dsphere and 2d indexes support $nearSphere.

Settings\n * TLS/SSL Settings \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn about the different settings to control the behavior of your MongoClient. The following sections describe commonly used settings:      * MongoClient Settings  * Cluster Settings  * Socket Settings  * Connection Pool Settings  * Server Settings  * TLS/SSL Settings \nMONGOCLIENT SETTINGS \nYou can control the behavior of your MongoClient by creating and passing in a MongoClientSettings object to the MongoClients.create() method. To create a MongoClientSettings object, use the MongoClientSettings.builder() method and chain methods to specify your settings. After chaining them, use the build() method to create the MongoClientSettings object. The following table describes all the methods you can chain to modify your connection behavior: Method\nDescription\naddCommandListener()\nAdds a listener for command events.\napplicationName()\nSets the logical name of the application using the MongoClient.\napplyConnectionString()\nApplies the settings from the given ConnectionString to the builder. If you omit this method, the driver attempts to connect to localhost.\napplyToClusterSettings()\nApplies the ClusterSettings.Builder block and then sets the cluster settings.\napplyToConnectionPoolSettings()\nApplies the ConnectionPoolSettings.Builder block and then sets the connection pool settings.\napplyToServerSettings()\nApplies the ServerSettings.Builder block and then sets the server settings.\napplyToSocketSettings()\nApplies the SocketSettings.Builder block and then sets the socket settings.\napplyToSslSettings()\nApplies the SslSettings.Builder block and then sets the TLS/SSL settings.\nautoEncryptionSettings()\nSets the auto-encryption settings. \nIf you omit keyVaultClient or set\nbypassAutomaticEncryption to false in your\nAutoEncryptionSettings, the driver creates a separate,\ninternal MongoClient. \nThe internal MongoClient configuration differs from the\nparent MongoClient by setting the minPoolSize to 0 and\nomitting the AutoEncryptionSettings.\ncodecRegistry()\nSets the codec registry.\ncommandListenerList()\nSets the command listeners.\ncompressorList()\nSets the compressors to use for compressing messages to the server.\ncredential()\nSets the credential.\nreadConcern()\nSets the read concern.\nreadPreference()\nSets the read preference.\nretryReads()\nWhether the driver should retry reads if a network error occurs.\nretryWrites()\nWhether the driver should retry writes if a network error occurs.\nserverApi()\nSets the server API to use when sending commands to the server.\nstreamFactoryFactory()\nSets the factory to use to create a StreamFactory.\nuuidRepresentation()\nSets the UUID representation to use when encoding instances of UUID and decoding BSON binary values with subtype of 3.\nwriteConcern()\nSets the write concern. \nEXAMPLE \nThis example demonstrates specifying a ConnectionString: MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(    MongoClientSettings.builder()    .applyConnectionString(new ConnectionString(\"<your connection string>\"))    .build());  \nTIP Each setting has an applyConnectionString() method. They are rarely needed within the settings, so you should use this method as shown in the preceding example. \nNOTE \nCHAIN ORDER Some options in the settings map to a connection string option. If you specify the same options in your settings and connection string, the order you chain them determines which option the driver uses. The driver uses the last setting it reads. For example, this snippet contains settings with the following times for the driver to connect to an available socket:  * The connection string specifies within 2 SECONDS  * The socket settings specifies within 5 SECONDS MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(   MongoClientSettings.builder().applyConnectionString(new ConnectionString(\"mongodb+srv:/<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>?connectTimeoutMS(2000)\"))      .applyToSocketSettings(builder ->      builder.connectTimeout(5, SECONDS))      .build());  Since the driver reads the socket settings options last, the driver expects to connect to an available socket within 5 SECONDS before timing

\nLOG YOUR SETTINGS To log the MongoClient instance settings, set the org.mongodb.driver.client named logger to the INFO level. To learn more about logging with the MongoDB Java Driver, see the Logging guide. \nCLUSTER SETTINGS \nChain the applyToClusterSettings() method to modify the driver's behavior when interacting with your MongoDB cluster. The following table describes all the methods you can chain to your settings to modify the driver's behavior: Method\nDescription\naddClusterListener()\nAdds a listener for cluster-related events.\napplyConnectionString()\nUses the settings from a ConnectionString object.\napplySettings()\nUses the cluster settings specified in a ClusterSettings object.\nhosts()\nSets all the specified locations of a Mongo server.\nlocalThreshold()\nSets the amount of time that a server’s round trip can take and still be eligible for server selection.\nmode()\nSets how to connect to a MongoDB server.\nrequiredClusterType()\nSets the type of cluster required for the cluster.\nrequiredReplicaSetName()\nSets the replica set name required for the cluster.\nserverSelectionTimeout()\nSets the maximum time to select a primary node before throwing a timeout exception.\nserverSelector()\nAdds a server selector to apply before server selection.\nsrvHost() Sets the host name to use to look up an SRV DNS record to find the MongoDB hosts. \nNOTE When setting srvHost, the driver does not process any associated TXT records associated with the host. If you want to enable the processing of TXT records, you must specify the SRV host in the connection string using the applyConnectionString() method. MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(   MongoClientSettings.builder()      .applyConnectionString(new ConnectionString(\"mongodb+srv://host1.acme.com\"))) \nsrvMaxHosts()\nSets the maximum number of hosts the driver can connect to when using the DNS seedlist (SRV) connection protocol, identified by the mongodb+srv connection string prefix. \nThrows an exception if you are not using the SRV connection protocol. \nEXAMPLE \nThis example specifies for the driver to connect directly to a server, regardless of the type of MongoDB cluster its' a part of: MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(    MongoClientSettings.builder()    .applyToClusterSettings(builder ->        builder.mode(ClusterConnectionMode.SINGLE)    .build());  \nTIP This is analogous to the directConnection parameter you can specify in your connection URI. See Connection Options for more information. \nSOCKET SETTINGS \nChain the applyToSocketSettings() method to modify the driver's behavior when connecting and communicating with your MongoDB server. The following table describes all the methods you can chain to your settings to modify the driver's behavior: Method\nDescription\napplyConnectionString()\nUses the settings from a ConnectionString object.\napplySettings()\nUses the socket settings specified in a SocketSettings object.\nconnectTimeout()\nSets the maximum time to connect to an available socket before throwing a timeout exception.\nreadTimeout()\nSets the maximum time to read to an available socket before throwing a timeout exception.\nreceiveBufferSize()\nSets the socket's buffer size when receiving.\nsendBufferSize()\nSets the socket's buffer size when sending. \nEXAMPLE \nThis example specifies the following driver behavior in a MongoDB socket:  * To connect to an available socket within 10 SECONDS  * To read from an available socket within 15 SECONDS MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(    MongoClientSettings.builder().applyConnectionString(new ConnectionString(\"<your connection string>\"))    .applyToSocketSettings(builder ->        builder.connectTimeout(10, SECONDS)        .readTimeout(15, SECONDS))    .build());  \nCONNECTION POOL SETTINGS \nChain the applyToConnectionPoolSettings() method to modify the way the driver manages its connection pool.

specify updates using builders in the MongoDB Java driver. The Updates builder provides helper methods for the following types of updates:      * Field Updates  * Array Updates  * Combining Multiple Update Operators Some methods that expect updates are:  * updateOne()  * updateMany()  * bulkWrite() The Updates class provides static factory methods for all the MongoDB update operators. Each method returns an instance of the BSON type, which you can pass to any method that expects an update argument. \nTIP For brevity, you may choose to import the methods of the Updates class statically: import static com.mongodb.client.model.Updates.*;  The following examples assume this static import. The examples in this guide use the following document: {    \"_id\": 1,    \"color\": \"red\",    \"qty\": 5,    \"vendor\": [ \"A\", \"D\", \"M\" ],    \"lastModified\": { \"$date\": \"2021-03-05T05:00:00Z\" }}  \nFIELD UPDATES  SET \nUse the set() method to assign the value of a field in an update operation. The following example sets the value of the qty field to \"11\": Bson filter = eq(\"_id\", 1);Bson update = set(\"qty\", 11);collection.updateOne(filter, update);  The preceding example updates the original document to the following state: {   \"_id\": 1,   \"color\": \"red\",   \"qty\": 11,   \"vendor\": [ \"A\", \"D\", \"M\" ],   \"lastModified\": { \"$date\": \"2021-03-05T05:00:00Z\" }} \nUNSET \nUse the unset() method to delete the value of a field in an update operation. The following example deletes the qty field: Bson filter = eq(\"_id\", 1);Bson update = unset(\"qty\");collection.updateOne(filter, update);  The preceding example updates the original document to the following state: {   \"_id\": 1,   \"color\": \"red\",   \"vendor\": [ \"A\", \"D\", \"M\" ],   \"lastModified\": { \"$date\": \"2021-03-05T05:00:00Z\" }} \nSET ON INSERT \nUse the setOnInsert() method to assign the value of a field in an update operation on an insert of a document. The following example sets the value of the qty field to \"5\" if an upsert resulted in the insert of a document: Bson filter = eq(\"_id\", 1);Bson update = setOnInsert(\"qty\", 7);collection.updateOne(filter, update, new UpdateOptions().upsert(true));  The preceding example updates the original document to the following state: {   \"_id\": 1,   \"color\": \"red\",   \"qty\": 5,   \"vendor\": [ \"A\", \"D\", \"M\" ],   \"lastModified\": { \"$date\": \"2021-03-05T05:00:00Z\" }} \nNOTE If the document is not inserted, no change will occur. \nINCREMENT \nUse the inc() method to increment the value of a numeric field in an update operation. The following example increments the value of the qty field by \"3\": Bson filter = eq(\"_id\", 1);Bson update = inc(\"qty\", 3);collection.updateOne(filter, update);  The preceding example updates the original document to the following state: {   \"_id\": 1,   \"color\": \"red\",   \"qty\": 8,   \"vendor\": [ \"A\", \"D\", \"M\" ],   \"lastModified\": { \"$date\": \"2021-03-05T05:00:00Z\" }}

The following example sets the value of the lastModified field to the current date as a BSON date: Bson filter = eq(\"_id\", 1);Bson update = currentDate(\"lastModified\");collection.updateOne(filter, update);  The preceding example updates the original document to the following state: {   \"_id\": 1,   \"color\": \"red\",   \"qty\": 5,   \"vendor\": [ \"A\", \"D\", \"M\" ],   \"lastModified\": { \"$date\": \"2021-03-22T21:01:20.027Z\" }} \nCURRENT TIMESTAMP \nUse the currentTimestamp() method to assign the value of a field in an update operation to the current date as a timestamp. The following example sets the value of the lastModified field to the current date as a BSON timestamp: Bson filter = eq(\"_id\", 1);Bson update = currentTimestamp(\"lastModified\");collection.updateOne(filter, update);  The preceding example updates the original document to the following state: {   \"_id\": 1,   \"color\": \"red\",   \"qty\": 5,   \"vendor\": [ \"A\", \"D\", \"M\" ],   \"lastModified\": { \"$timestamp\": { \"t\": 1616446880, \"i\": 5 } }} \nBIT \nUse the bitwiseOr(), bitwiseAnd(), and bitwiseXor() methods to perform a bitwise update of the integer value of a field in an update operation. The following example performs a bitwise AND between the number \"10\" and the integer value of the qty field: Bson filter = eq(\"_id\", 1);Bson update = bitwiseOr(\"qty\",

The following example removes the value \"D\" from the vendor array: Bson filter = eq(\"_id\", 1);Bson update = pull(\"vendor\", \"D\");collection.updateOne(filter, update);  The preceding example updates the original document to the following state: {   \"_id\": 1,   \"color\": \"red\",   \"qty\": 5,   \"vendor\": [ \"A\", \"M\" ],   \"lastModified\": { \"$date\": \"2021-03-05T05:00:00Z\" }} \nPUSH \nUse the push() method to append a value to an array in an update operation. The following examples pushes \"C\" to the vendor array: Bson filter = eq(\"_id\", 1);Bson update = push(\"vendor\", \"C\");collection.updateOne(filter, update);  The preceding example updates the original document to the following state: {   \"_id\": 1,   \"color\": \"red\",   \"qty\": 5,   \"vendor\": [ \"A\", \"D\", \"M\", \"C\" ],   \"lastModified\": { \"$date\": \"2021-03-05T05:00:00Z\" }} \nCOMBINING MULTIPLE UPDATE OPERATORS \nAn application can update multiple fields of a single document by combining two or more of the update operators described in the preceding sections. The following example increments the value of the qty field by \"6\", sets the value of the color field to \"purple\", and pushes \"R\" to the vendor field: Bson filter = eq(\"_id\", 1);Bson update =

\nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to specify a query in the MongoDB Java driver. Most CRUD operations allow you to narrow the set of matched documents by specifying matching criteria in a query filter. Query filters contain one or more query operators that apply to specific fields which determine which documents to include in the result set. In this page, we cover the following query operators with examples on how to use them:      * Comparison Operators  * Logical Operators  * Array Operators  * Element Operators  * Evaluation Operators The examples in this guide use the following documents in the paint_purchases collection: { \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"red\", \"qty\": 9, \"vendor\": [\"A\", \"E\"] }{ \"_id\": 2, \"color\": \"purple\", \"qty\": 8, \"vendor\": [\"B\", \"D\", \"F\"], \"rating\": 5 }{ \"_id\": 3, \"color\": \"blue\", \"qty\": 5, \"vendor\": [\"A\", \"E\"] }{ \"_id\": 4, \"color\": \"white\", \"qty\": 6, \"vendor\": [\"D\"], \"rating\": 9 }{ \"_id\": 5, \"color\": \"yellow\", \"qty\": 4, \"vendor\": [\"A\", \"B\"] }{ \"_id\": 6, \"color\": \"pink\", \"qty\": 3, \"vendor\": [\"C\"] }{ \"_id\": 7, \"color\": \"green\", \"qty\": 8, \"vendor\": [\"C\", \"E\"], \"rating\": 7 }{ \"_id\": 8, \"color\": \"black\", \"qty\": 7, \"vendor\": [\"A\", \"C\", \"D\"] }  \nCOMPARISON OPERATORS \nComparison operators query data based on comparisons with values in a collection. Common comparison operators include gt() for \"greater than\" comparisons, lte() for \"less than or equal to\" comparisons, and ne() for \"not equal to \" comparisons. The following example uses the Filters.gt() method to match all documents where the value of qty is greater than 7 in the paint_purchases collection: Bson filter = Filters.gt(\"qty\", 7);collection.find(filter).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));  The following shows the output of the preceding query:  { \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"red\", \"qty\": 9, \"vendor\": [\"A\", \"E\"] } { \"_id\": 2, \"color\": \"purple\", \"qty\": 8, \"vendor\": [\"B\", \"D\", \"F\"], \"rating\": 5 } { \"_id\": 7, \"color\": \"green\", \"qty\": 8, \"vendor\": [\"C\", \"E\"], \"rating\": 7 } \nLOGICAL OPERATORS \nLogical operators query data using logic applied to the results of field-level operators. Common logical operators include and() where all operators must be true, and or() where at least one of the operators must be true. The following example uses the Filters.and() method to match documents where the value of qty is less than or equal to 5 and the value of color is not \"pink\" in the paint_purchases collection: Bson filter = Filters.and(Filters.lte(\"qty\", 5), Filters.ne(\"color\", \"pink\"));collection.find(filter).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));  The following shows the output of the preceding query:  { \"_id\": 3, \"color\": \"blue\", \"qty\": 5, \"vendor\": [\"A\", \"E\"] } { \"_id\": 5, \"color\": \"yellow\", \"qty\": 4, \"vendor\": [\"A\", \"B\"] } \nARRAY OPERATORS \nArray operators query data based on the value or quantity of elements in an array field. The following example uses the Filters.size() method to match documents where the size of the vendor list is 3 in the paint_purchases collection: Bson filter = Filters.size(\"vendor\",

Condition\n * Example With Race Condition\n * Example Without Race Condition \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to perform compound operations with the MongoDB Java driver. Compound operations consist of a read and write operation performed as one atomic operation. An atomic operation is an operation which either completes entirely, or does not complete at all. Atomic operations cannot partially complete. Atomic operations can help you avoid race conditions in your code. A race condition occurs when your code's behavior is dependent on the order of uncontrollable events. MongoDB supports the following compound operations:      * Find and update one document  * Find and replace one document  * Find and delete one document If you need to perform more complex tasks atomically, such as reading and writing to more than one document, use transactions. Transactions are a feature of MongoDB and other databases that lets you define an arbitrary sequence of database commands as an atomic operation. For more information on atomic operations and atomicity, see the MongoDB manual entry for atomicity and transactions. For more information on transactions, see the MongoDB manual entry for transactions. \nHOW TO USE COMPOUND OPERATIONS \nThis section shows how to use each compound operation with the MongoDB Java Driver. The following examples use a collection containing these two sample documents.  {\"_id\": 1, \"food\": \"donut\", \"color\": \"green\"} {\"_id\": 2, \"food\": \"pear\", \"color\": \"yellow\"} The full code for the following examples is available on Github here. \nNOTE \nBEFORE OR AFTER THE WRITE? By default, each compound operation returns your found document in the state before your write operation. You can retrieve your found document in the state after your write operation by using the options class corresponding to your compound operation. You can see an example of this configuration in the Find and Replace example below. \nFIND AND UPDATE \nTo find and update one document, use the findOneAndUpdate() method of the MongoCollection class. The findOneAndUpdate() method returns your found document or null if no documents match your query. EXAMPLE \nThe following example uses the findOneAndUpdate() method to find a document with the color field set to \"green\" and update the food field in that document to \"pizza\". The example also uses a FindOneAndUpdateOptions instance to specify the following options:  * Exclude the _id field from the found document with a projection.  * Specify an upsert, which inserts the document specified by the query filter if no documents match the query.  * Set a maximum execution time of 5 seconds for this operation on the MongoDB instance. If the operation takes longer, the findOneAndUpdate() method will throw a MongoExecutionTimeoutException. // <MongoCollection set up code here>Bson projection = Projections.excludeId();Bson filter = Filters.eq(\"color\", \"green\");Bson update = Updates.set(\"food\", \"pizza\");FindOneAndUpdateOptions options = new FindOneAndUpdateOptions().        projection(projection).        upsert(true).        maxTime(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);/* The result variable contains your document in the   state before your update operation is performed. */Document result = collection.findOneAndUpdate(filter, update, options);System.out.println(result.toJson());  The output of the preceding code should look like this: {\"food\": \"donut\", \"color\": \"green\"} For more information on the Projections class, see our guide on the Projections builder. For more information on the upsert operation, see our guide on upserts. For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * findOneAndUpdate()  * FindOneAndUpdateOptions  * MongoExecutionTimeoutException \nFIND AND REPLACE \nTo find and replace one document, use the findOneAndReplace() method of the MongoCollection class. The findOneAndReplace() method returns your found document or null if no documents match your query. EXAMPLE \nThe following example uses the findOneAndReplace() method to find a document with the color field set to \"green\" and replace it with the following document: {\"music\": \"classical\",

 The output of the preceding code should look like this: {\"_id\": 1, \"music\": \"classical\", \"color\": \"green\"} For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * findOneAndReplace()  * FindOneAndReplaceOptions \nFIND AND DELETE \nTo find and delete one document, use the findOneAndDelete() method of the MongoCollection class. The findOneAndDelete() method returns your found document or null if no documents match your query. EXAMPLE \nThe following example uses the findOneAndDelete() method to find and delete the document with the largest value in the _id field. The example uses a FindOneAndDeleteOptions instance to specify a descending sort on the _id field. // <MongoCollection set up code here>Bson sort = Sorts.descending(\"_id\");Bson filter = Filters.empty();FindOneAndDeleteOptions options = new FindOneAndDeleteOptions().        sort(sort);Document result = collection.findOneAndDelete(filter, options);System.out.println(result.toJson());  The output of the preceding code should look like this: {\"_id\": 2, \"food\": \"pear\", \"color\": \"yellow\"} For more information on the Sorts class, see our guide on the Sorts builder. For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * findOneAndDelete()  * FindOneAndDeleteOptions \nAVOIDING A RACE CONDITION \nIn this section we explore two examples. The first example contains a race condition, the second example uses a compound operation to avoid the race condition present in the first example. For both examples, let's imagine that we run a hotel with one room and that we have a small Java program to help us checkout this room to a guest. The following document in MongoDB represents the room:  {\"_id\": 1, \"guest\": null, \"room\": \"Blue Room\", \"reserved\": false} The full code for this example is available on Github here. \nEXAMPLE WITH RACE CONDITION \nLet's say our app uses this bookARoom method to checkout our room to a guest: public void bookARoom() {    Bson filter = Filters.eq(\"reserved\", false);    Document myRoom = this.collection.find(filter).first();    if (myRoom == null){        System.out.println(\"Sorry, we are booked \" + this.guest);        return;    }    String myRoomName = myRoom.getString(\"room\");    System.out.println(\"You got the \" + myRoomName + \" \" + this.guest);    Bson update = Updates.combine(Updates.set(\"reserved\", true), Updates.set(\"guest\", guest));    Bson roomFilter = Filters.eq(\"_id\", myRoom.get(\"_id\", Integer.class));    this.collection.updateOne(roomFilter, update);}  Imagine two separate guests, Jan and Pat, try to book the room with this method at the same time. Jan sees this output: You got the Blue Room Jan And Pat sees this output: You got the Blue Room Pat When we look at our database, we see the following:  {\"_id\": 1, \"guest\": \"Jan\", \"room\": \"Blue Room\", \"reserved\": true} Pat will be unhappy. When Pat shows up to our hotel, Jan will be occupying her room. What went wrong? Here is the sequence of events that happened from the perspective of our MongoDB instance:  * Find and return an empty room for Jan  * Find and return an empty room for Pat  * Update the room to booked for Pat  * Update the room to booked for Jan Notice that for a brief moment Pat had reserved the room, but as Jan's update operation was the last to execute our document has \"Jan\" as the

Docs Home → Java Sync \nSKIP RETURNED RESULTS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Examples\n * Using a FindIterable\n * Using Aggregation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to skip a specified number of returned results from read operations with the MongoDB Java driver. You can skip results on the returned results of a query by using the skip() method. You can also skip documents at a specific stage in an aggregation pipeline by specifying a $skip aggregation stage. The skip() method takes an integer that specifies the number of documents to omit from the beginning of the list of documents returned by the FindIterable. You can use the skip() method to skip the first two documents as follows: collection.find().skip(2);  Aggregates.skip() is an optional stage in the aggregation pipeline that specifies how many documents to omit from the beginning of the results of the prior stage. You can use the Aggregates.skip() method to skip the first two documents as follows: import com.mongodb.client.model.Aggregates;\ncollection.aggregate(Arrays.asList(Aggregates.match(), Aggregates.skip(2)));  \nEXAMPLES \nThe following example is about a paint store that sells eight different colors of paint. The best colors sell quicker than the other colors. One day, a customer asks what the three best-selling (lowest inventory) colors are. The paint store keeps track of inventory in the qty field in their paint_inventory collection: { \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"red\", \"qty\": 5 }{ \"_id\": 2, \"color\": \"purple\", \"qty\": 10 }{ \"_id\": 3, \"color\": \"blue\", \"qty\": 9 }{ \"_id\": 4, \"color\": \"white\", \"qty\": 6 }{ \"_id\": 5, \"color\": \"yellow\", \"qty\": 11 }{ \"_id\": 6, \"color\": \"pink\", \"qty\": 3 }{ \"_id\": 7, \"color\": \"green\", \"qty\": 8 }{ \"_id\": 8, \"color\": \"orange\", \"qty\": 7 }  To address the scenario, the paint store needs to query the paint_inventory collection with an empty filter, sort the documents by qty field and omit the first five results. \nUSING A FINDITERABLE \nimport com.mongodb.client.model.Filters;import com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts;\n// <MongoCollection setup code here>\nBson filter = Filters.empty();collection.find(filter)                 .sort(Sorts.descending(\"qty\"))            .skip(5)                           .forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson())); \n     * The find() method returns all documents.  * The sort() method specifies documents to display from highest to lowest based on the qty field.  * The skip() method specifies to omit the first five documents. \nUSING AGGREGATION \nimport com.mongodb.client.model.Filters;import com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts;import com.mongodb.client.model.Aggregates;\n// <MongoCollection setup code here>\nBson filter = Filters.empty();collection.aggregate(Arrays.asList(    Aggregates.match(filter),     Aggregates.sort(Sorts.descending(\"qty\")),     Aggregates.skip(5)))    .forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));    * The match() stage returns all documents.  * The sort() stage specifies documents to display from highest to lowest based on the qty field.  * The skip() stage specifies to omit the first five documents. The following shows the output of both preceding queries: { \"_id\": 4, \"color\": \"white\", \"qty\": 6 }{ \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"red\", \"qty\": 5 }{ \"_id\": 6, \"color\": \"pink\", \"qty\": 3 }

Docs Home → Java Sync \nLIMIT THE NUMBER OF RETURNED RESULTS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Specify a Limit\n * Combining Skip and Limit \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to limit the number of results returned from read operations with the MongoDB Java driver. Use limit() to cap the number of documents that a read operation returns. This instance method designates the maximum number of documents that a read operation can return. If there are not enough documents to reach the specified limit, it can return a smaller number. If you use limit() with the skip() instance method, the skip applies first and the limit only applies to the documents left over after the skip. For more information on the skip() method, see our guide on Skipping Returned Documents. The following examples demonstrate, respectively, how to insert data into a collection, how to use limit() to restrict the number of returned documents, and how to combine limit() with skip() to further narrow the results returned from a query. \nSAMPLE DOCUMENTS \nThe following operation inserts documents representing books into a collection: collection.insertMany(Arrays.asList(    new Document().append(\"_id\", 1)        .append(\"title\", \"The Brothers Karamazov\").append(\"length\", 824)        .append(\"author\", \"Dostoyevsky\"),    new Document().append(\"_id\", 2)        .append(\"title\", \"Les Misérables\").append(\"length\", 1462).append(\"author\", \"Hugo\"),    new Document().append(\"_id\", 3)        .append(\"title\", \"Atlas Shrugged\").append(\"length\", 1088).append(\"author\", \"Rand\"),    new Document().append(\"_id\", 4)        .append(\"title\", \"Infinite Jest\").append(\"length\", 1104).append(\"author\", \"Wallace\"),    new Document().append(\"_id\", 5)        .append(\"title\", \"Cryptonomicon\").append(\"length\", 918).append(\"author\", \"Stephenson\"),    new Document().append(\"_id\", 6)        .append(\"title\", \"A Dance with Dragons\").append(\"length\", 1104)        .append(\"author\", \"Martin\")));  \nSPECIFY A LIMIT \nThe next example queries the collection to return the top three longest books. It first matches all the documents with the query, then sorts on the length field to return books with longer lengths before books with shorter lengths. Lastly, it limits the return value to 3 documents: import com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts;\n// define a cursor that will return the first 3 sorted itemsMongoCursor<Document> cursor = collection.find()    .sort(descending(\"length\"))    .limit(3)    .iterator();// print out itemstry {    while (cursor.hasNext()) {        System.out.println(cursor.next());    }}// close the cursorfinally {    cursor.close();}  The preceding code example prints out the following three documents, sorted by length:  Document{{_id=2, title=Les Misérables, author=Hugo, length=1462}} Document{{_id=6, title=A Dance with Dragons, author=Martin, length=1104}} Document{{_id=4, title=Infinite Jest, author=Wallace, length=1104}} \nTIP The order in which you call limit() and sort() does not matter because the driver reorders the calls to apply the sort first and the limit after it. The following two calls are equivalent: collection.find().sort(descending(\"length\")).limit(3);collection.find().limit(3).sort(descending(\"length\"));  \nCOMBINING SKIP AND LIMIT \nTo see the next three longest books, append the skip() method to your find() call. The integer argument passed to skip() will determine how many documents the find operation returns: MongoCursor<Document> cursor = collection.find()    .sort(ascending(\"length\"))    .limit(3)

Docs Home → Java Sync \nSEARCH TEXT \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Sample Documents\n * Text Index\n * Text Search\n * Specify Options\n * Search Text by a Term\n * Search Text by a Phrase\n * Search Text with Terms Excluded \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to run a text search in the MongoDB Java driver. You can use a text search to retrieve documents that contain a term or a phrase in a specified field. A term is a sequence of characters that excludes whitespace characters. A phrase is a sequence of terms with any number of whitespace characters. The following sections show you how to perform the following types of text searches:      * Search Text by a Term  * Search Text by a Phrase  * Search Text with Terms Excluded If you want to sort your text search results, see the Text Search section of our Sort Results guide. \nSAMPLE DOCUMENTS \nThe following sections feature examples of text searches on the fast_and_furious_movies collection. Each section uses a variable named collection to refer to the MongoCollection instance of the fast_and_furious_movies collection. The fast_and_furious_movies collection contains documents that describe one of the several movies that are part of the Fast and Furious movie franchise. Each document contains a title field and a tags field. { \"_id\": 1, \"title\": \"2 Fast 2 Furious \", \"tags\": [\"undercover\", \"drug dealer\"] }{ \"_id\": 2, \"title\": \"Fast 5\", \"tags\": [\"bank robbery\", \"full team\"] }{ \"_id\": 3, \"title\": \"Furious 7\", \"tags\": [\"emotional\"] }{ \"_id\": 4, \"title\": \"The Fate of the Furious\", \"tags\": [\"betrayal\"] }  \nTEXT INDEX \nYou must create a text index before running a text search. A text index specifies the string or string array field on which to run a text search. In the following examples, you run text searches on the title field in the fast_and_furious_movies collection. To enable text searches on the title field, create a text index using the Indexes builder with the following snippet: collection.createIndex(Indexes.text(\"title\"));  For more information, see the following resources:  * Text Indexes section of our Indexes guide  * Text Indexes Server Manual Entry \nTEXT SEARCH \nUse the Filters.text() method to specify a text search. The Filters.text() method uses the Filters builder to define a query filter specifying what to search for during the text search. The query filter is represented by a BSON instance. Pass the query filter to the find() method to run a text search. When you execute the find() method, MongoDB runs a text search on all the fields indexed with the text index on the collection. MongoDB returns documents that contain one or more of the search terms and a relevance score for each result. For more information on relevance scores, see the Text Search section in our Sort Results guide. \nSPECIFY OPTIONS \nYou can include TextSearchOptions as the second parameter of the Filters.text() method to specify text search options such as case sensitivity. By default, text searches run without case sensitivity which means the search matches lowercase and uppercase values. To specify a case sensitive search, use the following snippet: TextSearchOptions options = new TextSearchOptions().caseSensitive(true);Bson filter = Filters.text(\"SomeText\", options);  For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * Filters.text()  * TextSearchOptions \nSEARCH TEXT BY A TERM \nPass a term as a string to the Filters.text() method to specify the term in your text search. EXAMPLE \nThe following example runs a text search on the documents in the fast_and_furious_movies collection for titles that contain the term \"fast\": Bson filter = Filters.text(\"fast\");collection.find(filter).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));  The following shows the output of the preceding code: { \"_id\": 1, \"title\": \"2 Fast 2 Furious \",

Text Search \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use the sort operation to order your results from read operations with the MongoDB Java driver. The sort operation orders the documents returned from your query by your specified sort criteria. Sort criteria are the rules you pass to MongoDB that describe how you would like your data to be ordered. Some examples of sort criteria are:      * Smallest number to largest number  * Earliest time of day to latest time of day  * Alphabetical order by first name You should read this guide if you would like to:  * Perform ascending sorts and descending sorts.  * Combine sort criteria.  * Sort on the text score of a text search. The examples in this guide use a sample collection that contains the following documents: {\"_id\": 1, \"letter\": \"c\", \"food\": \"coffee with milk\"}{\"_id\": 3, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"maple syrup\"}{\"_id\": 4, \"letter\": \"b\", \"food\": \"coffee with sugar\"}{\"_id\": 5, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"milk and cookies\"}{\"_id\": 2, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"donuts and coffee\"}{\"_id\": 6, \"letter\": \"c\", \"food\": \"maple donut\"}  \nMETHODS FOR SORTING \nYou can sort results retrieved by a query and you can sort results within an aggregation pipeline. To sort your query results, use the sort() method of a FindIterable instance. To sort your results within an aggregation pipeline, use the Aggregates.sort() static factory method. Both of these methods receive objects that implement the Bson interface as arguments. For more information, see our API Documentation for the BSON interface. You can use the sort() method of a FindIterable instance as follows: import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.ascending;\n// <MongoCollection setup code here>\ncollection.find().sort(ascending(\"_id\"));  You can use the Aggregates.sort() method within an aggregation pipeline as follows: import com.mongodb.client.model.Aggregates;import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.ascending;\n// <MongoCollection setup code here>\ncollection.aggregate(Arrays.asList(Aggregates.sort(ascending(\"_id\"))));  The preceding code snippets sort the documents in the sample collection from smallest to largest value of the _id field: {\"_id\": 1, \"letter\": \"c\", \"food\": \"coffee with milk\"}{\"_id\": 2, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"donuts and coffee\"}{\"_id\": 3, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"maple syrup\"}... In the preceding code snippets, we specify our sort criteria using the Sorts builder class. While it is possible to specify sort criteria using any class that implements the Bson interface, we recommend that you specify sort criteria through the Sorts builder. For more information on the Sorts builder class, see our guide on the Sorts builder. For more information about the classes and interfaces in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * FindIterable  * Aggregates  * Sorts  * BSON  * Document \nSORTING DIRECTION \nThe direction of your sort can either be ascending or descending. An ascending sort orders your results from smallest to largest. A descending sort orders your results from largest to smallest. Here are some examples of data sorted in ascending order:  * Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 43, 43, 55, 120  * Dates: 1990-03-10, 1995-01-01, 2005-10-30, 2005-12-21  * Words (ASCII): Banana, Dill, carrot, cucumber, hummus Here are some examples of data sorted in descending order:  * Numbers: 100, 30, 12, 12, 9, 3, 1  * Dates: 2020-01-01, 1998-12-11, 1998-12-10, 1975-07-22  * Words (reverse ASCII): pear, grapes, apple, Cheese The following subsections show how to specify these sort criteria. \nASCENDING \nTo specify an ascending sort, use the Sorts.ascending() static factory method.

import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.ascending;\n// <MongoCollection setup code here>\ncollection.find().sort(ascending(\"<field name>\"));  The preceding sort() method returns a FindIterable object that can iterate over the documents in your collection, sorted from smallest to largest on the specified field name. In the following code example, we use the ascending() method to sort the sample collection by the _id field: import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.ascending;\n// <MongoCollection setup code here>\nList<Document> results = new ArrayList<>();collection.find().sort(ascending(\"_id\")).into(results);for (Document result : results) {      System.out.println(result.toJson());}  The output of the preceding code example should look something like this: {\"_id\": 1, \"letter\": \"c\", \"food\": \"coffee with milk\"}{\"_id\": 2, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"donuts and coffee\"}{\"_id\": 3, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"maple syrup\"}... \nDESCENDING \nTo specify a descending sort, use the Sorts.descending() static factory method. Pass the Sorts.descending() method the name of the field you need to sort in descending order. The following code snippet shows how to specify a descending sort on the _id field: import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.descending;\n// <MongoCollection setup code here>\ncollection.find().sort(descending(\"_id\"));  The preceding code snippet returns the documents in the sample collection in descending order: {\"_id\": 6, \"letter\": \"c\", \"food\": \"maple donut\"}{\"_id\": 5, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"milk and cookies\"}{\"_id\": 4, \"letter\": \"b\", \"food\": \"coffee with sugar\"}... \nHANDLING TIES \nA tie occurs when two or more documents have identical values in the field you are using to order your results. MongoDB does not guarantee sort order in the event of ties. For example, suppose we encounter a tie when applying a sort to the sample collection using the following code: import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.ascending;\n// <MongoCollection setup code here>\ncollection.find().sort(ascending(\"letter\"));  Since multiple documents that matched our query contain the value \"a\" for the field on which we perform the sort, the following documents could be returned in any order: {\"_id\": 3, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"maple syrup\"}{\"_id\": 5, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"milk and cookies\"}{\"_id\": 2, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"donuts and coffee\"} If you need to guarantee a specific sort order for documents that have fields with identical values, you can specify additional fields to sort on in the event of a tie. We can specify an ascending sort on the letter field followed by the _id field as follows: import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.ascending;\n// <MongoCollection setup code here>\ncollection.find().sort(ascending(\"letter\", \"_id\"));  The preceding code snippet returns the documents in the sample collection in the following order: {\"_id\": 2, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"donuts and coffee\"}{\"_id\": 3, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"maple syrup\"}{\"_id\": 5, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"milk and cookies\"}{\"_id\": 4, \"letter\": \"b\", \"food\": \"coffee with sugar\"}{\"_id\": 1, \"letter\": \"c\", \"food\": \"coffee with milk\"}{\"_id\": 6, \"letter\": \"c\", \"food\": \"maple donut\"} \nCOMBINING SORT CRITERIA \nTo combine sort criteria, use the Sorts.orderBy() static factory method. This method constructs an object containing an ordered list of sort criteria. When performing the sort, if the leftmost sort criteria results in a tie, the sort uses the next sort criteria in the list to determine the

SEARCH \nYou can specify the order of the results of a text search by how closely the string values of each result's fields specified by the collection's text index match your search string. The text search assigns a numerical text score to indicate how closely each result matches the search string. Use the Sorts.metaTextScore() static factory method to build your sort criteria to sort by the text score. \nIMPORTANT \nMAKE SURE TO CREATE A TEXT INDEX You need a text index on your collection to perform a text search. See the server manual documentation for more information on how to create a text index. In the following code example, we show how you can use the Sorts.metaTextScore() method to sort the results of a text search on the sample collection. The code example uses the Filters, Indexes, and Projections builders. The code example performs the following actions:  1. Creates a text index for your sample collection on the food field. If you call createIndex() specifying an index that already exists on the collection, the operation does not create a new index.  2. Runs your text search for the phrase \"maple donut\".  3. Projects text scores into your query results as the score field.  4. Sorts your results by text score (best match first). import com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts;import com.mongodb.client.model.Projections;import com.mongodb.client.model.Filters;import com.mongodb.client.model.Indexes;\n// <MongoCollection setup code here>\ncollection.createIndex(Indexes.text(\"food\"));Bson metaTextScoreSort = Sorts.metaTextScore(\"score\");Bson metaTextScoreProj = Projections.metaTextScore(\"score\");String searchTerm = \"maple donut\";Bson searchQuery = Filters.text(searchTerm);collection.find(searchQuery)         .projection(metaTextScoreProj)         .sort(metaTextScoreSort)         .into(results);for (Document result : results) {      System.out.println(result.toJson());}  The output of the preceding code example should look something like this: {\"_id\": 6, \"letter\": \"c\", \"food\": \"maple donut\", \"score\": 1.5}{\"_id\": 2, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"donuts and coffee\", \"score\": 0.75}{\"_id\": 3, \"letter\": \"a\", \"food\": \"maple syrup\", \"score\": 0.75} \nNOTE \nTEXT SEARCH BEHAVIOR IN MONGODB 4.4 OR LATER The structure of text search has changed for MongoDB 4.4 or later. You no longer need to project Projections.metaTextScore() into your FindIterable instance in order to sort on the text score. In addition, the field name you specify in a $meta text score aggregation operation used in a sort is ignored. This means that the field name argument you pass to Sorts.metaTextScore() is disregarded. For more information about the classes in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * Filters  * Indexes  * Projections  * MongoCollection For more information, see the Sorts class API Documentation.

Geospatial Queries\n * Query Operators\n * Query Parameters\n * Examples\n * Query by Proximity\n * Query Within a Range \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to search geospatial data with the MongoDB Java Driver, and the different geospatial data formats supported by MongoDB. Geospatial data is data that represents a geographical location on the surface of the Earth. Examples of geospatial data include:      * Locations of movie theaters  * Borders of countries  * Routes of bicycle rides  * Dog exercise areas in New York City \nCOORDINATES ON EARTH \nTo store and query your geospatial data in MongoDB, use GeoJSON. GeoJSON is a data format created by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Here is the location of MongoDB headquarters in GeoJSON: \"MongoDB Headquarters\" : {   \"type\": \"point\",   \"coordinates\": [-73.986805, 40.7620853]}  For definitive information on GeoJSON, see the official IETF specification. \nGEOJSON POSITIONS \nA position represents a single place on Earth, and exists in code as an array containing two or three number values:  * Longitude in the first position (required)  * Latitude in the second position (required)  * Elevation in the third position (optional) \nIMPORTANT \nLONGITUDE THEN LATITUDE GeoJSON orders coordinates as longitude first and latitude second. This may be surprising as geographic coordinate system conventions generally list latitude first and longitude second. Make sure to check what format any other tools you are working with use. Popular tools such as OpenStreetMap and Google Maps list coordinates as latitude first and longitude second. \nGEOJSON TYPES \nYour GeoJSON object's type determines its geometric shape. Geometric shapes are made up of positions. Here are some common GeoJSON types and how you can specify them with positions:  * Point: a single position. This could represent the location of a sculpture.  * LineString: an array of two or more positions, thus forming a series of line segments. This could represent the route of the Great Wall of China.  * Polygon: an array of positions in which the first and last position are the same, thus enclosing some space. This could represent the land within Vatican City. To learn more about the shapes you can use in MongoDB, see the GeoJSON manual entry. \nINDEX \nTo query data stored in the GeoJSON format, add the field containing GeoJSON data to a 2dsphere index. The following snippet creates a 2dsphere index on the location.geo field using the Indexes builder: // <MongoCollection setup code here>collection.createIndex(Indexes.geo2dsphere(\"location.geo\"));  For more information on the Indexes builder, see our guide on the Indexes builder. \nCOORDINATES ON A 2D PLANE \nYou can store geospatial data using x and y coordinates on a two-dimensional Euclidean plane. We refer to coordinates on a two-dimensional plane as \"legacy coordinate pairs\". Legacy coordinate pairs have the following structure: \"<field name>\" : [ x, y ]  Your field should contain an array of two values in which the first represents the x axis value and the second represents the y axis value. \nINDEX \nTo query data stored as legacy coordinate pairs, you must add the field containing legacy coordinate pairs to a 2d index. The following snippet creates a 2d index on the coordinates field using the Indexes builder: // <MongoCollection setup code here>collection.createIndex(Indexes.geo2d(\"coordinates\"));  For more information on the Indexes builder, see our guide on the Indexes builder. For more information on legacy coordinate pairs, see the MongoDB server manual page on legacy coordinate pairs. \nTIP \nSUPPORTED OPERATORS Spherical (2dsphere) and flat (2d) indexes support some, but not all, of the same query operators. For a full list of operators and their index compatibility, see the manual entry for geospatial queries. \nGEOSPATIAL QUERIES \nGeospatial queries consist of a query operator and GeoJSON shapes as

 * $geoIntersects requires a 2dsphere index You can specify these query operators in the MongoDB Java driver with the near(), geoWithin(), nearSphere(), and geoIntersects() utility methods of the Filters builder class. For more information on geospatial query operators, see the manual entry for geospatial queries. For more information on Filters, see our guide on the Filters builder. \nQUERY PARAMETERS \nTo specify a shape to use in a geospatial query, use the Position, Point, LineString, and Polygon classes of the MongoDB Java driver. For a full list of the GeoJSON shapes available in the MongoDB Java driver, see the GeoJSON package API Documentation. \nEXAMPLES \nThe following examples use the MongoDB Atlas sample dataset. You can learn how to set up your own free-tier Atlas cluster and how to load the sample dataset in our quick start guide. The examples use the theaters collection in the sample_mflix database from the sample dataset. The theaters collection contains a 2dsphere index on the location.geo field. The examples require the following imports: import java.util.Arrays;import org.bson.conversions.Bson;import com.mongodb.client.model.geojson.Point;import com.mongodb.client.model.geojson.Polygon;import com.mongodb.client.model.geojson.Position;import static com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.near;import static com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.geoWithin;import static com.mongodb.client.model.Projections.fields;import static com.mongodb.client.model.Projections.include;import static com.mongodb.client.model.Projections.excludeId;  You can find the source code for the examples on Github here. \nQUERY BY PROXIMITY \nTo search for and return documents from nearest to farthest from a point, use the near() static utility method of the Filters builder class. The near() method constructs a query with the $near query operator. The following example queries for theaters between 10,000 and 5,000 meters from the Great Lawn of Central Park. // code to set up your mongo client ...MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase(\"sample_mflix\");MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection(\"theaters\");Point centralPark = new Point(new Position(-73.9667, 40.78));Bson query = near(\"location.geo\", centralPark, 10000.0, 5000.0);Bson projection = fields(include(\"location.address.city\"), excludeId());collection.find(query)        .projection(projection)        .forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc.toJson()));  The output of the code snippet should look something like this: {\"location\": {\"address\": {\"city\": \"Bronx\"}}}{\"location\": {\"address\": {\"city\": \"New York\"}}}{\"location\": {\"address\": {\"city\": \"New York\"}}}{\"location\": {\"address\": {\"city\": \"Long Island City\"}}}{\"location\": {\"address\": {\"city\": \"New York\"}}}{\"location\": {\"address\": {\"city\": \"Secaucus\"}}}{\"location\": {\"address\": {\"city\": \"Jersey City\"}}}{\"location\": {\"address\": {\"city\": \"Elmhurst\"}}}{\"location\": {\"address\": {\"city\": \"Flushing\"}}}{\"location\": {\"address\": {\"city\": \"Flushing\"}}}{\"location\": {\"address\": {\"city\": \"Flushing\"}}}{\"location\": {\"address\": {\"city\": \"Elmhurst\"}}} \nTIP \nFUN FACT MongoDB uses the same reference system as GPS satellites to calculate geometries over the Earth. For more information on the $near operator, see the reference documentation for $near. For more information on Filters, see our guide on the Filters builder. \nQUERY WITHIN A RANGE \nTo search for geospatial data within a specified shape use the geoWithin() static utility method of the Filters builder class. The geoWithin() method constructs a query with the $geoWithin query operator.

Metadata \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use the Aggregates class which provides static factory methods that build aggregation pipeline stages in the MongoDB Java driver. For a more thorough introduction to Aggregation, see our Aggregation guide. \nTIP For brevity, you may choose to import the methods of the following classes statically to make your queries more succinct:      * Aggregates  * Filters  * Projections  * Sorts  * Accumulators import static com.mongodb.client.model.Aggregates.*;import static com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.*;import static com.mongodb.client.model.Projections.*;import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.*;import static com.mongodb.client.model.Accumulators.*;import static java.util.Arrays.asList;  The examples on this page assume these static imports, in addition to statically importing the asList() method. Use these methods to construct pipeline stages and specify them in your aggregation as a list: Bson matchStage = match(eq(\"some_field\", \"some_criteria\"));Bson sortByCountStage = sortByCount(\"some_field\");collection.aggregate(asList(matchStage, sortByCountStage)).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc));  \nMATCH \nUse the match() method to create a $match pipeline stage that matches incoming documents against the specified query filter, filtering out documents that do not match. \nTIP The filter can be an instance of any class that implements Bson, but it's convenient to combine with use of the Filters class. The following example creates a pipeline stage that matches all documents where the title field is equal to \"The Shawshank Redemption\": match(eq(\"title\", \"The Shawshank Redemption\"));  \nPROJECT \nUse the project() method to create a $project pipeline stage that project specified document fields. Field projection in aggregation follows the same rules as field projection in queries. \nTIP Though the projection can be an instance of any class that implements Bson, it's convenient to combine with use of Projections. The following example creates a pipeline stage that excludes the _id field but includes the title and plot fields: project(fields(include(\"title\", \"plot\"), excludeId()));  \nPROJECTING COMPUTED FIELDS \nThe $project stage can project computed fields as well. The following example creates a pipeline stage that projects the rated field into a new field called rating, effectively renaming the field. project(fields(computed(\"rating\", \"$rated\"), excludeId()));  \nDOCUMENTS \nUse the documents() method to create a $documents pipeline stage that returns literal documents from input values. \nIMPORTANT If you use a $documents stage in an aggregation pipeline, it must be the first stage in the pipeline. The following example creates a pipeline stage that creates sample documents with a title field: documents(asList(        new Document(\"title\", \"The Shawshank Redemption\"),        new Document(\"title\", \"Back to the Future\"),        new Document(\"title\", \"Jurassic Park\")));  \nIMPORTANT If you use the documents() method to provide the input to an aggregation pipeline, you must call the aggregate() method on a database instead of on a collection. \nSAMPLE \nUse the sample() method to create a $sample pipeline stage to randomly select documents from input.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that sorts in descending order according to the value of the year field and then in ascending order according to the value of the title field: sort(orderBy(descending(\"year\"), ascending(\"title\")));  \nSKIP \nUse the skip() method to create a $skip pipeline stage to skip over the specified number of documents before passing documents into the next stage. The following example creates a pipeline stage that skips the first 5 documents: skip(5);  \nLIMIT \nUse the $limit pipeline stage to limit the number of documents passed to the next stage. The following example creates a pipeline stage that limits the number of documents to 10: limit(10);  \nLOOKUP \nUse the lookup() method to create a $lookup pipeline stage to perform joins and uncorrelated subqueries between two collections. \nLEFT OUTER JOIN \nThe following example creates a pipeline stage that performs a left outer join between the movies and comments collections:  * It joins the _id field from movies to the movie_id field in comments  * It outputs the results in the joined_comments field: lookup(\"comments\", \"_id\", \"movie_id\", \"joined_comments\");  \nFULL JOIN AND UNCORRELATED SUBQUERIES \nThe following example creates a pipeline stage that joins two collections, orders and warehouses, by the item and whether the available quantity is enough to fulfill the ordered quantity: List<Variable<String>> variables = asList(new Variable<>(\"order_item\", \"$item\"),        new Variable<>(\"order_qty\", \"$ordered\"));\nList<Bson> pipeline = asList(        match(expr(new Document(\"$and\",                asList(new Document(\"$eq\", asList(\"$$order_item\", \"$stock_item\")),                        new Document(\"$gte\", asList(\"$instock\", \"$$order_qty\")))))),        project(fields(exclude(\"stock_item\"), excludeId())));\nList<Bson> innerJoinLookup = lookup(\"warehouses\", variables, pipeline, \"stockdata\");  \nGROUP \nUse the group() method to create a $group pipeline stage to group documents by a specified expression and output a document for each distinct grouping. \nTIP The driver includes the Accumulators class with static factory methods for each of the supported accumulators. The following example creates a pipeline stage that groups documents by the value of the customerId field. Each group accumulates the sum and average of the values of the quantity field into the totalQuantity and averageQuantity fields. group(\"$customerId\", sum(\"totalQuantity\", \"$quantity\"), avg(\"averageQuantity\", \"$quantity\"));  Learn more about accumulator operators from the Server manual section on Accumulators. \nPICK-N ACCUMULATORS \nThe pick-n accumulators are aggregation accumulation operators that return the top and bottom elements given a specific ordering. Use one of the following builders to create an aggregation accumulation operator:  * minN()  * maxN()  * firstN()  * lastN()  * top()  * topN()  * bottom()  * bottomN() \nTIP You can only perform aggregation operations with these pick-n accumulators when running MongoDB v5.2 or later. Learn which aggregation pipeline stages you can use accumulator operators with from the Server manual section on Accumulators. \nMINN \nThe minN() builder creates the $minN accumulator which returns data from documents that contain the n lowest values of a grouping. \nTIP The $minN and $bottomN accumulators can perform similar tasks. See Comparison of $minN and $bottomN Accumulators for recommended usage of each. The following example demonstrates how to use the minN() method to return the lowest three imdb.rating values for movies, grouped by year: group(        \"$year\",        minN(                \"lowest_three_ratings\",                new BsonString(\"$imdb.rating\"),                3                ));  See the minN() API documentation for more information. \nMAXN \nThe maxN() accumulator

The following example demonstrates how to use the top() method to return the title and imdb.rating values for the top rated movies based on the imdb.rating, grouped by year. group(        \"$year\",         top(                \"top_rated_movie\",                descending(\"imdb.rating\"),                asList(new BsonString(\"$title\"), new BsonString(\"$imdb.rating\"))                ));  See the top() API documentation for more information. \nTOPN \nThe topN() accumulator returns data from documents that contain the highest n values for the specified field. \nTIP The $firstN and $topN accumulators can perform similar tasks. See Comparison of $firstN and $topN Accumulators for recommended usage of each. The following example demonstrates how to use the topN() method to return the title and runtime values of the three longest movies based on the runtime values, grouped by year. group(        \"$year\",         topN(                \"longest_three_movies\",                descending(\"runtime\"),                asList(new BsonString(\"$title\"), new BsonString(\"$runtime\")),                3                ));  See the topN() API documentation for more information. \nBOTTOM \nThe bottom() accumulator returns data from the last document in a group based on the specified sort order.

 See the bottom() API documentation for more information. \nBOTTOMN \nThe bottomN() accumulator returns data from documents that contain the lowest n values for the specified field. \nTIP The $minN and $bottomN accumulators can perform similar tasks. See Comparison of $minN and $bottomN Accumulators for recommended usage of each. The following example demonstrates how to use the bottomN() method to return the title and imdb.rating values of the two lowest rated movies based on the imdb.rating value, grouped by year: group(        \"$year\",         bottomN(                \"lowest_rated_two_movies\",                descending(\"imdb.rating\"),                asList(new BsonString(\"$title\"), new BsonString(\"$imdb.rating\")),                2                ));  See the bottomN() API documentation for more information. \nUNWIND \nUse the unwind() method to create an $unwind pipeline stage to deconstruct an array field from input documents, creating an output document for each array element. The following example creates a document for each element in the sizes array: unwind(\"$sizes\");  To preserve documents that have missing or null values for the array field, or where array is empty: unwind(\"$sizes\", new UnwindOptions().preserveNullAndEmptyArrays(true));  To include the array index, in this example in a field called \"position\": unwind(\"$sizes\", new UnwindOptions().includeArrayIndex(\"position\"));  \nOUT \nUse the out() method to create an $out pipeline stage that writes all documents to the specified collection in the same database. \nIMPORTANT The $out stage must be the last stage in any aggregation pipeline. The following example writes the results of the pipeline to the authors collection: out(\"authors\");  \nMERGE \nUse the merge() method to create a $merge pipeline stage that merges all documents into the specified collection. \nIMPORTANT The $merge stage must be the last stage in any aggregation pipeline. The following example merges the pipeline into the authors collection using the default options: merge(\"authors\");  The following example merges the pipeline into the customers collection in the reporting database using some non-default options that specify to replace the document if both date and customerId match, otherwise insert the document: merge(new MongoNamespace(\"reporting\", \"customers\"),        new MergeOptions().uniqueIdentifier(asList(\"date\", \"customerId\"))                .whenMatched(MergeOptions.WhenMatched.REPLACE)                .whenNotMatched(MergeOptions.WhenNotMatched.INSERT));  \nGRAPHLOOKUP \nUse the graphLookup() method to create a $graphLookup pipeline stage that performs a recursive search on a specified collection to match a specified field in one document to a specified field of another document. The following example computes the social network graph for users in the contacts collection, recursively matching the value in the friends field to the name field: graphLookup(\"contacts\", \"$friends\", \"friends\", \"name\", \"socialNetwork\");  Using GraphLookupOptions, you can specify the depth to recurse as well as the name of the depth field, if desired. In this example, $graphLookup will recurse up to two times, and create a field called degrees with the recursion depth information for every document. graphLookup(\"contacts\", \"$friends\", \"friends\", \"name\", \"socialNetwork\",        new GraphLookupOptions().maxDepth(2).depthField(\"degrees\"));  Using GraphLookupOptions, you can specify a filter that documents must match in order for MongoDB to include them in your search. In this example, only links with \"golf\" in their hobbies field will be included. graphLookup(\"contacts\", \"$friends\", \"friends\", \"name\", \"socialNetwork\",        new

\nTIP The $sortByCount stage is identical to a $group stage with a $sum accumulator followed by a $sort stage. [    { \"$group\": { \"_id\": <expression to group on>, \"count\": { \"$sum\": 1 } } },    { \"$sort\": { \"count\": -1 } }]  The following example groups documents by the truncated value of the field x and computes the count for each distinct value: sortByCount(new Document(\"$floor\", \"$x\"));  \nREPLACEROOT \nUse the replaceRoot() method to create a $replaceRoot pipeline stage that replaces each input document with the specified document. The following example replaces each input document with the nested document in the spanish_translation field: replaceRoot(\"$spanish_translation\");  \nADDFIELDS \nUse the addFields() method to create an $addFields pipeline stage that adds new fields to documents. \nTIP Use $addFields when you do not want to project field inclusion or exclusion. The following example adds two new fields, a and b to the input documents: addFields(new Field(\"a\", 1), new Field(\"b\", 2));  \nCOUNT \nUse the count() method to create a $count pipeline stage that counts the number of documents that enter the stage, and assigns that value to a specified field name. If you do not specify a field, count() defaults the field name to \"count\". \nTIP The $count stage is syntactic sugar for: { \"$group\":{ \"_id\": 0, \"count\": { \"$sum\" : 1 } } }  The following example creates a pipeline stage that outputs the count of incoming documents in a field called \"total\": count(\"total\");  \nBUCKET \nUse the bucket() method to create a $bucket pipeline stage that automates the bucketing of data around predefined boundary values. The following example creates a pipeline stage that groups incoming documents based on the value of their screenSize field, inclusive of the lower boundary and exclusive of the upper boundary. bucket(\"$screenSize\", asList(0, 24, 32, 50, 70, 200));  Use the BucketOptions class to specify a default bucket for values outside of the specified boundaries, and to specify additional accumulators. The following example creates a pipeline stage that groups incoming documents based on the value of their screenSize field, counting the number of documents that fall within each bucket, pushing the value of screenSize into a field called matches, and capturing any screen sizes greater than \"70\" into a bucket called \"monster\" for monstrously large screen sizes: \nTIP The driver includes the Accumulators class with static factory methods for each of the supported accumulators. bucket(\"$screenSize\", asList(0, 24, 32, 50, 70),        new BucketOptions().defaultBucket(\"monster\").output(sum(\"count\", 1), push(\"matches\", \"$screenSize\")));  \nBUCKETAUTO \nUse the bucketAuto() method to create a $bucketAuto pipeline stage that automatically determines the boundaries of each bucket in its attempt to distribute the documents evenly into a specified number of buckets. The following example creates a pipeline stage that will attempt to create and evenly distribute documents into 10 buckets using the value of their price field: bucketAuto(\"$price\", 10);  Use the BucketAutoOptions class to specify a preferred number based scheme to set boundary values, and specify additional accumulators. The following example creates a pipeline stage that will attempt to create and evenly distribute documents into 10 buckets using the value of their price field, setting the bucket boundaries at powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, ...). It also counts the number of documents in each bucket, and calculates their average price in a new field called avgPrice: \nTIP The driver includes the Accumulators class with static factory methods for each of the supported accumulators. bucketAuto(\"$price\", 10, new BucketAutoOptions().granularity(BucketGranularity.POWERSOF2)        .output(sum(\"count\", 1), avg(\"avgPrice\", \"$price\")));  \nFACET \nUse the facet() method to create a $facet pipeline stage that allows for the definition of parallel pipelines. The following example creates a pipeline stage that executes two parallel aggregations:  * The first aggregation distributes incoming documents into 5 groups according to their attributes.screen_size

 \nSETWINDOWFIELDS \nUse the setWindowFields() method to create a $setWindowFields pipeline stage that allows using window operators to perform operations on a specified span of documents in a collection. \nTIP \nWINDOW FUNCTIONS The driver includes the Windows class with static factory methods for building windowed computations. The following example creates a pipeline stage that computes the accumulated rainfall and the average temperature over the past month for each locality from more fine-grained measurements presented in the rainfall and temperature fields: Window pastMonth = Windows.timeRange(-1, MongoTimeUnit.MONTH, Windows.Bound.CURRENT);setWindowFields(\"$localityId\", Sorts.ascending(\"measurementDateTime\"),        WindowedComputations.sum(\"monthlyRainfall\", \"$rainfall\", pastMonth),        WindowedComputations.avg(\"monthlyAvgTemp\", \"$temperature\", pastMonth));  \nDENSIFY \nUse the densify() method to create a $densify pipeline stage that generates a sequence of documents to span a specified interval. \nTIP You can use the $densify() aggregation stage only when running MongoDB v5.1 or later. Consider the following documents retrieved from the Atlas sample weather dataset that contain measurements for a similar position field, spaced one hour apart: Document{{ _id=5553a..., position=Document{{type=Point, coordinates=[-47.9, 47.6]}}, ts=Mon Mar 05 08:00:00 EST 1984, ... }}Document{{ _id=5553b..., position=Document{{type=Point, coordinates=[-47.9, 47.6]}}, ts=Mon Mar 05 09:00:00 EST 1984, ... }} Suppose you needed to create a pipeline stage that performs the following actions on these documents:  * Add a document at every 15-minute interval for which a ts value does not already exist.  * Group the documents by the position field. The call to the densify() aggregation stage builder that accomplishes these actions should resemble the following: densify(        \"ts\",         DensifyRange.partitionRangeWithStep(15, MongoTimeUnit.MINUTE),        DensifyOptions.densifyOptions().partitionByFields(\"position.coordinates\"));  The following output highlights the documents generated by the aggregate stage which contain ts values every 15 minutes between the existing documents: Document{{ _id=5553a..., position=Document{{type=Point, coordinates=[-47.9, 47.6]}}, ts=Mon Mar 05 08:00:00 EST 1984, ... }}Document{{ position=Document{{coordinates=[-47.9, 47.6]}}, ts=Mon Mar 05 08:15:00 EST 1984 }}Document{{ position=Document{{coordinates=[-47.9, 47.6]}}, ts=Mon Mar 05 08:30:00 EST 1984 }}Document{{ position=Document{{coordinates=[-47.9, 47.6]}}, ts=Mon Mar 05 08:45:00 EST 1984 }}Document{{ _id=5553b..., position=Document{{type=Point, coordinates=[-47.9, 47.6]}}, ts=Mon Mar 05 09:00:00 EST 1984, ... }} See the densify package API documentation for more information. \nFILL \nUse the fill() method to create a $fill pipeline stage that populates null and missing field values. \nTIP You can use the $fill() aggregation stage only when running MongoDB v5.3 or later. Consider the following documents that contain temperature and air pressure measurements at an hourly interval: Document{{_id=6308a..., hour=1, temperature=23C, air_pressure=29.74}}Document{{_id=6308b..., hour=2, temperature=23.5C}}Document{{_id=6308c..., hour=3, temperature=null, air_pressure=29.76}} Suppose you needed to populate missing temperature and air pressure data points in the documents as follows:  * Populate the air_pressure field for hour \"2\" using linear interpolation to calculate the value.  * Set the missing temperature value to \"23.6C\" for hour \"3\".

Functional Iteration\n * Conditional Iteration\n * Cursor Cleanup\n * Close\n * Try with Resources Statement \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to access data using a cursor with the MongoDB Java driver. A cursor is a mechanism that allows an application to iterate over database results while only holding a subset of them in memory at a given time. The driver uses cursors in read operations that match multiple documents to return matched documents in batches as opposed to returning them all at once. This page uses an initiating method, find() to show how to access data from a FindIterable. \nNOTE The following ways to access and store data apply to other iterables such as an AggregateIterable. The find() method creates and returns an instance of a FindIterable. A FindIterable allows you to browse the documents matched by your search criteria and to further specify which documents to see by setting parameters through methods. \nTERMINAL METHODS \nTerminal methods execute an operation on the MongoDB server after configuring all parameters of an Iterable instance controlling the operation. \nFIRST \nUse the first() method to retrieve the first document in your query results: FindIterable<Document> iterable = collection.find();System.out.println(iterable.first());  This method is often used when your query filter will match one document, such as when filtering by a unique index. \nNUMBER OF RESULTS \nUse the available() method to retrieve the number of results locally present without blocking: MongoCursor<Document> cursor = collection.find().cursor();System.out.println(cursor.available());  The method returns 0 if the application has already iterated though all the documents in the cursor or if the cursor is closed. \nINTO \nUse the into() method to store your query results in a List: List<Document> results = new ArrayList<>();FindIterable<Document> iterable = collection.find();iterable.into(results);System.out.println(results);  This method is often used when your query filter returns a small number of documents that can fit into available memory. \nCURSOR \nUse the cursor() method to iterate through fetched documents and ensure that the cursor closes if there is an early termination: MongoCursor<Document> cursor = collection.find().cursor();  For more information on how to ensure a cursor closes, see the cursor cleanup section. \nEXPLAIN \nUse the explain() method to view information about how MongoDB executes your operation. The explain() method returns execution plans and performance statistics. An execution plan is a potential way MongoDB can complete an operation. The explain() method provides both the winning plan (the plan MongoDB executed) and rejected plans. You can specify the level of detail of your explanation by passing a verbosity level to the explain() method. The following table shows all verbosity levels for explanations and their intended use cases: Verbosity Level\nUse Case\nALL_PLANS_EXECUTIONS\nYou want to know which plan MongoDB will choose to run your query.\nEXECUTION_STATS\nYou want to know if your query is performing well.\nQUERY_PLANNER\nYou have a problem with your query and you want as much information as possible to diagnose the issue. The following example prints the JSON representation of the winning plan for aggregation stages that produce execution plans: Document explanation = collection.find().explain(ExplainVerbosity.EXECUTION_STATS);List<String> keys = Arrays.asList(\"queryPlanner\", \"winningPlan\");System.out.println(explanation.getEmbedded(keys, Document.class).toJson());  The preceding code snippet should produce the following output: { \"stage\": \"COLLSCAN\", \"direction\": \"forward\" } For more information on the explain operation, see the following Server Manual Entries:      * Explain Output  * Query Plans For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * first()  * available()  * into()  * cursor()  * explain()  * ExplainVerbosity \nUSAGE PATTERNS \nA MongoCursor and FindIterable allow you to access query results one document at a time, abstracting away

\nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use a change stream to monitor real-time changes to your database. A change stream is a MongoDB server feature that allows your application to subscribe to data changes on a single collection, database, or deployment. You can specify a set of aggregation operators to filter and transform the data your application receives. When connecting to a MongoDB deployment v6.0 or later, you can configure the events to include the document data before and after the change. Learn how to open and configure your change streams in the following sections:      * Open a Change Stream  * Apply Aggregation Operators to your Change Stream  * Include Pre-images and Post-images \nOPEN A CHANGE STREAM \nYou can open a change stream to subscribe to specific types of data changes and produce change events in your application. To open a change stream, call the watch() method on an instance of a MongoCollection, MongoDatabase, or MongoClient. \nIMPORTANT Standalone MongoDB deployments don't support change streams because the feature requires a replica set oplog. To learn more about the oplog, see the Replica Set Oplog server manual page. The object on which you call the watch() method on determines the scope of events that the change stream listens for. If you call watch() on a MongoCollection, the change stream monitors a collection. If you call watch() on a MongoDatabase, the change stream monitors all collections in that database. If you call watch() on a MongoClient, the change stream monitors all changes in the connected MongoDB deployment. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following code example shows how to open a change stream and print change stream events whenever the data in the collection changes: // The collection variable references a MongoCollection instanceChangeStreamIterable<Document> changeStream = collection.watch();\nchangeStream.forEach(event ->        System.out.println(\"Received a change: \" + event));  An insert operation on the collection should produce output similar to the following text: Received a change: ChangeStreamDocument{   operationType='insert',   resumeToken={\"_data\": \"825EC...\"},   namespace=myDb.myChangeStreamCollection,   ...} For a runnable example, see the Watch for Changes usage example page. To learn more about the watch() method, see the following API documentation:  * MongoCollection.watch()  * MongoDatabase.watch()  * MongoClient.watch() \nAPPLY AGGREGATION OPERATORS TO YOUR CHANGE STREAM \nYou can pass an aggregation pipeline as a parameter to the watch() method to specify which change events the change stream receives. To learn which aggregation operators your MongoDB server version supports, see Modify Change Stream Output. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following code example shows how you can apply an aggregation pipeline to configure your change stream to receive change events for only insert and update operations: List<Bson> pipeline = Arrays.asList(        Aggregates.match(Filters.in(\"operationType\", Arrays.asList(\"insert\", \"update\"))));\n// collection references a MongoCollection instanceChangeStreamIterable<Document> changeStream = collection.watch(pipeline);\nchangeStream.forEach(event ->        System.out.println(\"Received a change to the collection: \" + event));  When the change stream receives an update change event, the preceding code example outputs the following text: Received a change to the collection: ChangeStreamDocument{operationType=update, resumeToken={...},... \nINCLUDE PRE-IMAGES AND POST-IMAGES \nYou can configure the change event to contain or omit the following data:  * The pre-image which is a document that represents the version of the document before the operation if it exists  * The post-image which is a document that represents the version of the

Docs Home → Java Sync \nSPECIFY WHICH FIELDS TO RETURN \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Behavior\n * Explanation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to control which fields appear in documents returned from read operations with the MongoDB Java driver. Many read requests require only a subset of fields in a document. For example, when logging a user in you may only need their username, and not all of their profile information. By default, queries in MongoDB return all fields in matching documents. You can use a projection to return only the data you need. A projection is a document that instructs MongoDB which fields of a document to return. Use the Projections class to construct a projection document. \nBEHAVIOR \nProjections work in two ways:      * Explicitly including fields. This has the side-effect of implicitly excluding all unspecified fields.  * Implicitly excluding fields. This has the side-effect of implicitly including all unspecified fields. These two methods of projection are mutually exclusive: if you explicitly include fields, you cannot explicitly exclude fields, and vice versa. \nIMPORTANT The _id field is not subject to these mechanics. You must explicitly exclude the _id field if you do not want it returned. You can exclude the _id field even if you have specified certain fields to include. \nEXPLANATION \nConsider the following collection containing documents that describe varieties of fruit: { \"_id\": 1, \"name\": \"apples\", \"qty\": 5, \"rating\": 3 },{ \"_id\": 2, \"name\": \"bananas\", \"qty\": 7, \"rating\": 1 },{ \"_id\": 3, \"name\": \"oranges\", \"qty\": 6, \"rating\": 2 },{ \"_id\": 4, \"name\": \"avocados\", \"qty\": 3, \"rating\": 5 },  In the following query, pass the projection to return the name field of each document: // return all documents with *only* the name fieldBson filter = Filters.empty();Bson projection = Projections.fields(Projections.include(\"name\"));collection.find(filter).projection(projection).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc));  The projection document specifies that the read operation result should include the name field of each returned document. As a result, this projection implicitly excludes the qty and rating fields. Chaining this projection to find() with an empty query filter yields the following results: { \"_id\": 1, \"name\": \"apples\" }{ \"_id\": 2, \"name\": \"bananas\" }{ \"_id\": 3, \"name\": \"oranges\" }{ \"_id\": 4, \"name\": \"avocados\" } Despite the fact that this projection only explicitly included the name field, the query returned the _id field as well. The _id field is a special case: it is always included in every query result unless explicitly excluded. That's because the _id field is a unique identifier for each document, a property that can be useful when constructing queries. A movies collection is a good example of why this property is useful: because remakes and even separate works sometimes reuse movie titles, you need a unique _id value to refer to any specific movie. The _id is the only exception to the mutually exclusive include-exclude behavior in projections: you can explicitly exclude the _id field even when explicitly including other fields if you do not want _id to be present in returned documents. // return all documents with only the name fieldBson filter = Filters.empty();Bson projection = Projections.fields(Projections.include(\"name\"), Projections.excludeId());collection.find(filter).projection(projection).forEach(doc -> System.out.println(doc));  The projection document specifies that the read operation result should include the name field of each returned document, and specifies to exclude the _id field. As a result, this projection implicitly excludes the qty and rating fields. Chaining this projection to find() with an empty query filter yields the following results: { \"name\": \"apples\" }{ \"name\": \"bananas\" }{ \"name\": \"oranges\" }{ \"name\": \"avocados\" } You can

Order of Execution\n * Ordered Execution\n * Unordered Execution\n * Summary \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use bulk operations in the MongoDB Java Driver. To perform a create, replace, update, or delete operation, use its corresponding method. For example, to insert one document, update multiple documents, and delete one document in your collection, use the insertOne(), updateMany() and deleteOne() methods. The MongoClient performs these operations by making a call for each operation to the database. You can reduce the number of calls to the database to one by using bulk operations. \nPERFORMING BULK OPERATIONS \nBulk operations consist of a large number of write operations. To perform a bulk operation, pass a List of WriteModel documents to the bulkWrite() method. A WriteModel is a model that represents any of the write operations. The following sections show how to create and use each WriteModel document. The examples in each section contain the following documents in a collection: { \"_id\": 1 }{ \"_id\": 2 }  For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following API Documentation:      * bulkWrite()  * WriteModel  * BulkWriteOptions \nINSERT OPERATION \nTo perform an insert operation, create an InsertOneModel specifying the document you want to insert. To insert multiple documents, you must create an InsertOneModel for each document you want to insert. EXAMPLE \nThe following example creates an InsertOneModel for two documents where the _id values are \"3\" and \"4\": InsertOneModel<Document> doc1 = new InsertOneModel<>(new Document(\"_id\", 3));InsertOneModel<Document> doc2 = new InsertOneModel<>(new Document(\"_id\", 4));  \nIMPORTANT When performing a bulkWrite(), the InsertOneModel cannot insert a document with an _id that already exists in the collection. Instead, the method throws a MongoBulkWriteException. The following example tries to insert two documents where the _id is \"1\" and \"3\": try {    List<WriteModel<Document>> bulkOperations = new ArrayList<>();        InsertOneModel<Document> doc3 = new InsertOneModel<>(new Document(\"_id\", 1));    InsertOneModel<Document> doc4 = new InsertOneModel<>(new Document(\"_id\", 3));        bulkOperations.add(doc3);    bulkOperations.add(doc4);        collection.bulkWrite(bulkOperations); \n} catch (MongoBulkWriteException e){    System.out.println(\"A MongoBulkWriteException occured with the following message: \" + e.getMessage());}  The following shows the output of the preceding code: A MongoBulkWriteException occurred with the following message:Bulk write operation error on server sample-shard-00-02.pw0q4.mongodb.net:27017.Write errors: [BulkWriteError{index=0, code=11000, message='E11000 duplicate keyerror collection: crudOps.bulkWrite index: _id_ dup key: { _id: 1 }', details={}}]. To see why the document with the _id of \"3\" didn't insert, see the Order of Execution section. For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the InsertOneModel API Documentation. \nREPLACE OPERATION \nTo perform a replace operation, create a ReplaceOneModel specifying a query filter for the document you want to replace with the replacement document. \nIMPORTANT When performing a bulkWrite(), the ReplaceOneModel cannot make changes to a document that violate unique index constraints on the collection, and the model does not replace a document if there are no matches to your query filter.

 For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following resources:  * ReplaceOneModel API Documentation  * Unique indexes Server Manual Explanation \nUPDATE OPERATION \nTo perform an update operation, create an UpdateOneModel or an UpdateManyModel specifying a query filter for documents you want to update with what the updates are. The UpdateOneModel updates the first document that matches your query filter and the UpdateManyModel updates all the documents that match your query filter. \nIMPORTANT When performing a bulkWrite(), the UpdateOneModel and UpdateManyModel cannot make changes to a document that violate unique index constraints on the collection, and the models do not update any documents if there are no matches to your query filter. EXAMPLE \nThe following example creates an UpdateOneModel to update a document where the _id is \"2\" to a document that contains an additional field: UpdateOneModel<Document> doc3 = new UpdateOneModel<>(                                    Filters.eq(\"_id\", 2),                                     Updates.set(\"x\", 8));  For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following resources:  * UpdateOneModel API Documentation  * UpdateManyModel API Documentation  * unique indexes Server Manual Explanation \nDELETE OPERATION \nTo perform a delete operation, create a DeleteOneModel or a DeleteManyModel specifying a query filter for documents you want to delete. The DeleteOneModel deletes the first document that matches your query filter and the DeleteManyModel deletes all the documents that match your query filter. \nIMPORTANT When performing a bulkWrite(), the DeleteOneModel and DeleteManyModel do not delete any documents if there are no matches to your query filter. EXAMPLE \nThe following example creates a DeleteOneModel to delete a document where the _id is \"1\": DeleteOneModel<Document> doc3 = new DeleteOneModel<>(Filters.eq(\"_id\", 1));  For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following API Documentation:  * DeleteOneModel  * DeleteManyModel \nORDER OF EXECUTION \nThe bulkWrite() method accepts an optional BulkWriteOptions as a second parameter to specify if you want to execute the bulk operations as ordered or unordered. \nORDERED EXECUTION \nBy default, the bulkWrite() method executes bulk operations in order. This means that the bulk operations execute in the order you added them to the list until an error occurs, if any. EXAMPLE \nThe following example performs these bulk operations:  * An insert operation for a document where the _id is \"3\"  * A replace operation for a document where the _id is \"1\" with a document that contains an additional field  * An update operation for a document where the _id is \"3\" to a document that contains an additional field  * A delete operation for all documents that contain the field x with the value \"2\" List<WriteModel<Document>> bulkOperations = new ArrayList<>();\nInsertOneModel<Document> doc1 = new InsertOneModel<>(new Document(\"_id\", 3));ReplaceOneModel<Document> doc2 = new ReplaceOneModel<>(Filters.eq(\"_id\", 1),                                     new Document(\"_id\", 1).append(\"x\", 2));                            UpdateOneModel<Document> doc3 = new UpdateOneModel<>(Filters.eq(\"_id\", 3), Updates.set(\"x\", 2));DeleteManyModel<Document> doc4 = new DeleteManyModel<>(Filters.eq(\"x\", 2));\nbulkOperations.add(doc1);bulkOperations.add(doc2);bulkOperations.add(doc3);bulkOperations.add(doc4);\ncollection.bulkWrite(bulkOperations);                 After running this example, your

Docs Home → Java Sync \nUPDATE ARRAYS IN A DOCUMENT \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Sample Document\n * Specifying an Update\n * Specifying Array Elements\n * The First Matching Array Element\n * Matching All Array Elements\n * Matching Multiple Array Elements \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to update arrays in a document with the MongoDB Java driver. To update an array, you must do the following:      * Specify the update you want to perform  * Specify what array elements to apply your update to  * Perform an update operation using these specifications \nSAMPLE DOCUMENT \nThe following sections feature examples that update this sample document: { \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"green\", \"qty\": [8, 12, 18] }  The examples on this page use the findOneAndUpdate() method of the MongoCollection class to retrieve and update the document. Each example uses an instance of the FindOneAndUpdateOptions class to have MongoDB retrieve the document after the update occurs. For more information on the findOneAndUpdate() method, see our Compound Operations guide. \nSPECIFYING AN UPDATE \nTo specify an update, use the Updates builder. The Updates builder provides static utility methods to construct update specifications. For more information on using the Updates builder with arrays, see our guide on the Updates builder. The following example performs these actions:  * Query for the sample document  * Append \"17\" to the qty array in the document that matches the query filter Bson filter = Filters.eq(\"_id\", 1);Bson update = Updates.push(\"qty\", 17);FindOneAndUpdateOptions options = new FindOneAndUpdateOptions()                                    .returnDocument(ReturnDocument.AFTER);Document result = collection.findOneAndUpdate(filter, update, options);System.out.println(result.toJson());  The preceding example updates the original document to the following state: { \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"green\", \"qty\": [8, 12, 18, 17] } \nSPECIFYING ARRAY ELEMENTS \nYou can specify which array elements to update using a positional operator. Positional operators can specify the first, all, or certain array elements to update. To specify elements in an array with positional operators, use dot notation. Dot notation is a property access syntax for navigating BSON objects. For additional information, see the Server Manual Entry on dot notation. \nTHE FIRST MATCHING ARRAY ELEMENT \nTo update the first array element that matches your query filter, use the positional $ operator. The array field must appear as part of your query filter to use the positional $ operator. EXAMPLE \nThe following example performs these actions:  * Query for a document with a qty field containing the value \"18\"  * Decrement the first array value in the document that matches the query filter by \"3\" Bson filter = Filters.eq(\"qty\", 18);Bson update = Updates.inc(\"qty.$\", -3);FindOneAndUpdateOptions options = new FindOneAndUpdateOptions()                                    .returnDocument(ReturnDocument.AFTER);Document result = collection.findOneAndUpdate(filter, update, options);System.out.println(result.toJson());  The preceding example updates the original document to the following state: { \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"green\", \"qty\": [8, 12, 15] } For more information about the methods and operators mentioned in this section, see the following resources:  * Positional $ Operator Server Manual Entry  * inc() API Documentation \nMATCHING ALL ARRAY ELEMENTS \nTo update all elements in an array, use the all positional $[] operator.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nINSERT OPERATIONS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * A Note About _id\n * Insert a Single Document\n * Insert Multiple Documents\n * Summary \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to insert documents with the MongoDB Java driver. You can use MongoDB to retrieve, update, and delete information. To perform any of those operations, that information, such as user profiles and orders, needs to exist in MongoDB. For that information to exist, you need to first perform an insert operation. An insert operation inserts a single or multiple documents into MongoDB using the insertOne(), insertMany(), and bulkWrite() methods. The following sections focus on insertOne() and insertMany(). For information on how to use the bulkWrite() method, see our guide on Bulk Operations. \nA NOTE ABOUT _ID \nWhen inserting a document, MongoDB enforces one constraint on your documents by default: each document must contain a unique _id field. There are two ways to manage this field:      * You can manage this field yourself, ensuring each value you use is unique.  * You can let the driver automatically generate unique ObjectId values. Unless you have provided strong guarantees for uniqueness, we recommend you let the driver automatically generate _id values. \nNOTE Duplicate _id values violate unique index constraints, resulting in a WriteError. For additional information on unique indexes, see the manual entry on Unique Indexes. \nINSERT A SINGLE DOCUMENT \nUse the insertOne() method when you want to insert a single document. On successful insertion, the method returns an InsertOneResult instance representing the _id of the new document. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example creates and inserts a document using the insertOne() method: Document doc1 = new Document(\"color\", \"red\").append(\"qty\", 5);\nInsertOneResult result = collection.insertOne(doc1);System.out.println(\"Inserted a document with the following id: \"     + result.getInsertedId().asObjectId().getValue());  Your output should look something like this: Inserted a document with the following id: 60930c39a982931c20ef6cd6 For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section, see the following resources:  * insertOne() API Documentation  * InsertOneResult API Documentation  * Manual Explanation on insertOne()  * Runnable Insert a Document Example \nINSERT MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS \nUse the insertMany() method when you want to insert multiple documents. This method inserts documents in the order specified until an exception occurs, if any. For example, assume you want to insert the following documents: { \"_id\": 3, \"color\": \"red\", \"qty\": 5 }{ \"_id\": 4, \"color\": \"purple\", \"qty\": 10 }{ \"_id\": 3, \"color\": \"yellow\", \"qty\": 3 }{ \"_id\": 6, \"color\": \"blue\", \"qty\": 8 }  If you attempt to insert these documents, a WriteError occurs at the third document and the documents prior to the error get inserted into your collection. \nTIP Use a try-catch block to get an acknowledgment for successfully processed documents before the error occurs: List<Integer> insertedIds = new ArrayList<>();try {    InsertManyResult result = collection.insertMany(documents);      result.getInsertedIds().values()        .forEach(doc -> insertedIds.add(doc.asInt32().getValue()));    System.out.println(\"Inserted documents with the following ids: \" + insertedIds);} catch(MongoBulkWriteException exception) {    exception.getWriteResult().getInserts()        .forEach(doc -> insertedIds.add(doc.getId().asInt32().getValue()));    System.out.println(\"A MongoBulkWriteException occurred, but there are \" +         \"successfully processed documents with the following ids: \" + insertedIds);}  The output consists of documents MongoDB can process and should look something like this: A MongoBulkWriteException occurred, but there are successfully processeddocuments with the

Docs Home → Java Sync \nCHANGE A DOCUMENT \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Update\n * Update Operation Parameters\n * Replace\n * Replace Operation Parameters \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to change documents in a MongoDB collection using two distinct operation types:      * Update  * Replace Update operations specify the fields and values to change in one or more documents. A replace operation specifies the fields and values to replace a single document from your collection. In the following examples, a paint store sells five different colors of paint. The paint_inventory collection represents their current inventory: { \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"red\", \"qty\": 5 }{ \"_id\": 2, \"color\": \"purple\", \"qty\": 8 }{ \"_id\": 3, \"color\": \"yellow\", \"qty\": 0 }{ \"_id\": 4, \"color\": \"green\", \"qty\": 6 }{ \"_id\": 5, \"color\": \"pink\", \"qty\": 0 }  \nUPDATE \nUpdate operations can change fields and values. They apply changes specified in an update document to one or more documents that match your query filter. The updateOne() method changes the first document your query filter matches and the updateMany() method changes all the documents your query filter matches. You can call the updateOne() and updateMany() methods on a MongoCollection instance as follows: collection.updateOne(query, updateDocument);\ncollection.updateMany(query, updateDocument);  \nUPDATE OPERATION PARAMETERS \nThe updateOne() and updateMany() methods both have the following parameters:  * query specifies a query filter with the criteria to match documents to update in your collection  * updateDocument specifies the fields and values to change in the matching document or documents. For this example, we use the Updates builder to create the update document. You can create the updateDocument using an Updates builder as follows: Bson updateDocument = Updates.operator(field, value);  See the MongoDB API documentation for a complete list of Updates builders and their usage. EXAMPLE \nThe paint store receives a fresh shipment and needs to update their inventory. The shipment contains 20 cans of each paint color. To update the inventory, call the updateMany() method specifying the following:  * A query filter that matches all the colors  * An update document that contains instructions to increment the qty field by \"20\" Bson filter = Filters.empty();Bson update = Updates.inc(\"qty\", 20);UpdateResult result = collection.updateMany(filter, update);System.out.println(\"Matched document count: \" + result.getMatchedCount());System.out.println(\"Modified document count: \" + result.getModifiedCount());  Your output should look something like this:  Matched document count: 5 Modified document count: 5 The following shows the updated documents in the paint_inventory collection:  { \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"red\", \"qty\": 25 } { \"_id\": 2, \"color\": \"purple\", \"qty\": 28 } { \"_id\": 3, \"color\": \"yellow\", \"qty\": 20 } { \"_id\": 4, \"color\": \"green\", \"qty\": 26 } { \"_id\": 5, \"color\": \"pink\", \"qty\": 20 } If zero documents match the query filter in the update operation, updateMany() makes no changes to documents in the collection. See our upsert guide to learn how to insert a new document instead of updating one if no documents match. \nIMPORTANT The updateOne() and updateMany() methods cannot make changes to a document that violate unique index constraints on the collection. See the MongoDB server manual for more information on unique indexes. \nREPLACE \nA replace operation substitutes one document from your collection. The substitution occurs between a document your query filter matches and a replacement document. The replaceOne() method removes all the existing fields and values in the matching document (except the _id field) and substitutes it with the replacement document. You can call the replaceOne() method on a MongoCollection instance as follows: collection.replaceOne(query, replacementDocument);  \nREPLACE OPERATION PARAMETERS \nThe replaceOne() method has the following parameters:  * query specifies a query filter with the criteria to match a document to replace in your collection  * replacementDocument specifies fields and values of a new Document object to replace in the matched document EXAMPLE \nThe paint store realizes they need to update their inventory again. What they thought was 20 cans of pink paint is actually 25 cans of orange paint.

Docs Home → Java Sync \nDELETE A DOCUMENT \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Sample Documents\n * Delete Many Documents\n * Delete a Document\n * Find and Delete a Document \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to remove documents with the MongoDB Java driver. You can remove documents by passing a query filter to the deleteOne(), deleteMany() or findOneAndDelete() methods. The deleteOne() method deletes a single document. If the query filter matches more than one document, the method will remove the first occurrence of a match in the collection. The deleteMany() method deletes all documents that match the query filter. The findOneAndDelete() method atomically finds and deletes the first occurrence of a match in the collection. To specify a collation or hint an index, use DeleteOptions as a second parameter to the deleteOne() and deleteMany() methods. To specify a collation, hint an index, specify sort order, or specify a projection on the returned document, use FindOneAndDeleteOptions as the second parameter to the findOneAndDelete() method. \nSAMPLE DOCUMENTS \nThe following examples are about a paint store that sells eight different colors of paint. The store had their annual online sale resulting in the following documents in their paint_inventory collection: { \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"red\", \"qty\": 5 }{ \"_id\": 2, \"color\": \"purple\", \"qty\": 8 }{ \"_id\": 3, \"color\": \"blue\", \"qty\": 0 }{ \"_id\": 4, \"color\": \"white\", \"qty\": 0 }{ \"_id\": 5, \"color\": \"yellow\", \"qty\": 6 }{ \"_id\": 6, \"color\": \"pink\", \"qty\": 0 }{ \"_id\": 7, \"color\": \"green\", \"qty\": 0 }{ \"_id\": 8, \"color\": \"black\", \"qty\": 8 }  \nDELETE MANY DOCUMENTS \nThe paint store website displays all documents in the paint_inventory collection. To reduce customer confusion, the store wants to remove the colors that are out of stock. To remove the out of stock colors, query the paint_inventory collection where the qty is 0 and pass the query to the deleteMany() method: Bson filter = Filters.eq(\"qty\", 0);collection.deleteMany(filter);  The following shows the documents remaining in the paint_inventory collection:  { \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"red\", \"qty\": 5 } { \"_id\": 2, \"color\": \"purple\", \"qty\": 8 } { \"_id\": 5, \"color\": \"yellow\", \"qty\": 6 } { \"_id\": 8, \"color\": \"black\", \"qty\": 8 } \nDELETE A DOCUMENT \nThe store is donating the remaining quantity of their yellow paint. This means that the qty for yellow is now 0 and we need to remove yellow from the collection. To remove yellow, query the paint_inventory collection where the color is \"yellow\" and pass the query to the deleteOne() method: Bson filter = Filters.eq(\"color\", \"yellow\");collection.deleteOne(filter);  The following shows the documents remaining in the paint_inventory collection:  { \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"red\", \"qty\": 5 } { \"_id\": 2, \"color\": \"purple\", \"qty\": 8 } { \"_id\": 8, \"color\": \"black\", \"qty\": 8 } \nFIND AND DELETE A DOCUMENT \nThe store would like to raffle the remaining quantity of purple paint and remove purple from the paint_inventory collection. To pick a color, query the paint_inventory collection where the color is \"purple\" and pass the query to the findOneAndDelete() method: Bson filter = Filters.eq(\"qty\", 8);System.out.println(collection.findOneAndDelete(filter).toJson());  Unlike the other delete methods, findOneAndDelete() returns the deleted document:  { \"_id\": 2, \"color\": \"purple\", \"qty\": 8 } \nNOTE If there are no matches to your query filter, no document gets deleted and the method returns null. The following shows the documents remaining in the paint_inventory collection:  { \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"red\", \"qty\": 5 } { \"_id\": 8, \"color\": \"black\", \"qty\": 8 } For more information

Docs Home → Java Sync \nINSERT OR UPDATE IN A SINGLE OPERATION \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Specify an Upsert \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to perform an upsert with the MongoDB Java driver. Applications use insert and update operations to store and modify data. Sometimes, you need to choose between an insert and update depending on whether the document exists. MongoDB simplifies this decision for us with an upsert option. An upsert:      * Updates documents that match your query filter  * Inserts a document if there are no matches to your query filter \nSPECIFY AN UPSERT \nTo specify an upsert with the updateOne() or updateMany() methods, pass true to UpdateOptions.upsert(). To specify an upsert with the replaceOne() method, pass true to ReplaceOptions.upsert(). In the following example, a paint store sells eight different colors of paint. The store had their annual online sale. Their paint_inventory collection now shows the following documents: { \"_id\": { \"$oid\": \"606b4cfbcd83be7518b958da\" }, \"color\": \"red\", \"qty\": 5 }{ \"_id\": { \"$oid\": \"606b4cfbcd83be7518b958db\" }, \"color\": \"purple\", \"qty\": 8 }{ \"_id\": { \"$oid\": \"606b4cfbcd83be7518b958dc\" }, \"color\": \"blue\", \"qty\": 0 }{ \"_id\": { \"$oid\": \"606b4cfbcd83be7518b958dd\" }, \"color\": \"white\", \"qty\": 0 }{ \"_id\": { \"$oid\": \"606b4cfbcd83be7518b958de\" }, \"color\": \"yellow\", \"qty\": 6 }{ \"_id\": { \"$oid\": \"606b4cfbcd83be7518b958df\" }, \"color\": \"pink\", \"qty\": 0 }{ \"_id\": { \"$oid\": \"606b4cfbcd83be7518b958e0\" }, \"color\": \"green\", \"qty\": 0 }{ \"_id\": { \"$oid\": \"606b4cfbcd83be7518b958e1\" }, \"color\": \"black\", \"qty\": 8 }  The store received a fresh shipment and needs to update their inventory. The first item in the shipment is ten cans of orange paint. To update the inventory, query the paint_inventory collection where the color is \"orange\", specify an update to increment the qty field by 10, and specify true to UpdateOptions.upsert(): Bson filter = Filters.eq(\"color\", \"orange\");Bson update = Updates.inc(\"qty\", 10);UpdateOptions options = new UpdateOptions().upsert(true);System.out.println(collection.updateOne(filter, update, options));  The method returns:  AcknowledgedUpdateResult{ matchedCount=0, modifiedCount=0, upsertedId=BsonObjectId{ value=606b4cfc1601f9443b5d6978 }} This AcknowledgedUpdateResult tells us:  * Zero documents
