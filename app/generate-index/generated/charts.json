You can access Charts with any Organization Role. In Atlas, click Charts in the navigation bar. \nPREREQUISITES \nMongoDB Charts is accessible through MongoDB Atlas. You will need a MongoDB Atlas user account to complete this tutorial. To learn more about creating an Atlas user, see the Atlas Getting Started documentation. You will also need an Atlas cluster to visualize data using Charts. The steps on this page guide you through creating an Atlas cluster. \nNOTE Each instance of the MongoDB Charts application is tied to a single Atlas project, and can only visualize data from Atlas clusters within the same project. \nREQUIRED ACCESS \nThis tutorial requires that your Atlas user have the appropriate permissions to read data from the clusters in your Atlas project. This means that your Atlas user must have any Project Role except Project Read Only, which does not grant the appropriate permissions. When you first register an Atlas account, you are granted the Project Owner role on your initial project. For information on configuring additional users and roles, see Atlas Access in the Atlas documentation. \nPROCEDURE \n1 \nLOG INTO MONGODB ATLAS. \nTo access the MongoDB Charts application, you must be logged into Atlas. 2 \nSELECT YOUR DESIRED ATLAS PROJECT, OR CREATE A NEW PROJECT. \nIf you have an Atlas project with clusters containing data you wish to visualize, select the project from the Context dropdown in the left navigation pane. If you do not have a suitable existing Atlas project, see Create a Project in the Atlas documentation for instructions on creating a new project. 3 \n(OPTIONAL) INVITE PEOPLE TO YOUR ATLAS PROJECT AND SHARED CHARTS INSTANCE. \nAll Atlas project users with Project Roles other than Project Read Only have access to the Charts instance associated with that project. To add additional members to your Atlas project, see Manage Project Users and Teams in the Atlas documentation. 4 \n(OPTIONAL) CREATE AN ATLAS CLUSTER. \nThe MongoDB Charts application makes it easy to connect collections in your cluster as data sources. Data sources reference specific collections and charts views that you can access in the Chart Builder to visualize the data in those collections or charts views. \nNOTE You can skip this step if you already have an Atlas cluster in the current project. To create an Atlas cluster:       a. In the left navigation menu, click Clusters.  b. Click Build a New Cluster.  c. In the Create New Cluster page, choose your preferred cloud provider and region, cluster tier, and additional settings. As you build your cluster, Atlas displays the associated cluster costs at the bottom of the page.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    Atlas provides a Free Tier M0 replica set as well as paid M10+ clusters. Free Tier deployments have restrictions as compared to paid M10+ deployments, but will work for the purposes of this setup and all Charts tutorials offered in this documentation. For complete documentation on these restrictions, see Atlas M0 (Free Tier), M2, and M5 Limitations.  d. The default cluster name is Cluster0. If you wish to change your cluster name, do so now, as cluster names cannot be changed once configured.  e. Click the Create Cluster button to deploy your cluster.\n    \n    Your new cluster connects to Charts automatically. \nNOTE For complete instructions on creating an Atlas cluster and details on all available configuration options, see Create a Cluster in the Atlas documentation. 5 \nLAUNCH THE MONGODB CHARTS APPLICATION. \nIn Atlas, click Charts in the navigation bar. \nNOTE When you first launch MongoDB Charts in a project, Charts automatically creates new MongoDB users in your Atlas project to access your cluster data. The names of these users are in the format: mongodb-stitch-charts-<PROJECT-NAME>-<ID>_<CLUSTER-NAME>  \nTo navigate back to the Atlas Clusters view, click Data Services at the top of the MongoDB Charts application. \nMOVING FORWARD \nNow that you have a data source, you are ready to begin visualizing your data.

NAVIGATION MENU, CLICK DATA SOURCES. \nThe Data Sources page displays. 2 \nIN THE DEPLOYMENT DROPDOWN, SELECT THE DEPLOYMENT THAT CONTAINS YOUR DATA SOURCE. \nDeployments in MongoDB Charts reference Atlas deployments that contain valid Charts data sources, including:      * All clusters and serverless instances in your Atlas project for which you have the Project Data Access Read Only role or higher.  * All federated database instances in your project, including Online Archives. After you select a deployment, the following information displays: Field\nDescription\nDeployment Name\nHuman-readable label that identifies the deployment in Atlas.\nDeployment Connection Status\nLabel that indicates whether you connected the deployment to MongoDB Charts.\nType\nLabel that identifies the deployment as a replica set, serverless instance, or federated database instance.\nStatus\nLabel that indicates the current operating condition of the deployment.\nVersion\nLabel that indicates the MongoDB version on which the deployment runs. Charts doesn't display Version for federated database instances.\nRegion\nLabel that indicates the cloud provider and region where MongoDB provisions the deployment. Charts doesn't display Region for serverless instances.\nTier\nLabel that indicates the Atlas cluster tier for the deployment. Charts doesn't display Tier for federated database instances and serverless instances. 3 \nCHECK THE CONNECTION STATUS AND CONNECT THE DEPLOYMENT. \nIf the deployment connection status is Connected, the deployment is already connected to Charts. The Data Access section displays all of the collections within the selected Atlas deployment. If the deployment connection status is Disconnected:  a. Click the connect icon next to the deployment connection status.  b. Click Reconnect on the modal that appears. The deployment connects and the Data Access section displays all of the databases for the selected Atlas deployment. You can manage the following deployment settings. \nCONNECT OR DISCONNECT THE DEPLOYMENT OR DATA SOURCES \nAn Atlas Project Owner can connect the deployment or its data sources. To learn more, see Connect or Disconnect Data Sources and Deployments. \nNOTE Charts connects to all deployments and data sources in your project by default. To manage other data source settings, see Manage Data Sources. \nENABLE ORGANIZATION-WIDE SHARING FOR A DEPLOYMENT \nOrganization-wide sharing grants users in your organization, including users who are not members of your project, permission to view data in a deployment that is used for dashboards shared with your organization. You can enable organization-wide sharing for an entire deployment or for a specific data source. \nIMPORTANT If you enable organization-wide sharing for a deployment, it applies to all existing data sources and to any new data source you add to that deployment in the future. To enable organization-wide sharing for a deployment: 1 \nIN THE LEFT NAVIGATION MENU, CLICK DATA SOURCES. \nThe Data Sources page displays. 2 \nIN THE DEPLOYMENT DROPDOWN, SELECT THE DEPLOYMENT THAT CONTAINS YOUR DATA SOURCE. \nDeployments in MongoDB Charts reference Atlas deployments that contain valid Charts data sources, including:  * All clusters and serverless instances in your Atlas project for which you have the Project Data Access Read Only role or higher.  * All federated database instances in your project, including Online Archives. After you select a deployment, the following information displays: Field\nDescription\nDeployment Name\nHuman-readable label that identifies the deployment in Atlas.\nDeployment Connection Status\nLabel that indicates whether you connected the deployment to MongoDB Charts.\nType\nLabel that identifies the deployment as a replica set, serverless instance, or federated database instance.\nStatus\nLabel that indicates the current operating condition of the deployment.\nVersion\nLabel that indicates the MongoDB version on which the deployment runs. Charts doesn't display Version for federated database instances.\nRegion\nLabel that indicates the cloud provider and region where MongoDB provisions the deployment. Charts doesn't display Region for serverless instances.\nTier\nLabel that indicates the Atlas cluster tier for the deployment.

You can choose from the following sample dashboards.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    Each of the following links provides a public preview version of a sample dashboard where you can experiment with dashboard filtering and interactive filtering.\n    \n    * Product event metadata\n    \n    * Sales records\n    \n    * System metrics for observability\n    \n    * IoT time series data\n    \n    * Movie data After you select a category of sample data, Charts creates a new Sample Dashboard of which you are the Owner. You can also create a Sample Dashboard by going through the Charts Welcome Experience. \nSAMPLE DASHBOARD FILTERS \nSample dashboards come with preset example dashboard filters. You can adjust these filters to modify the data that appears on your dashboard. To learn more about filtering dashboard data, see Filter Dashboards by Field Values. \nREFRESH DASHBOARD DATA \nMongoDB Charts automatically refreshes chart data once it becomes out of date with the backing data source. You can also manually refresh dashboard data at any time. To learn how to configure refresh settings and underlying refresh behavior, see Refresh Dashboard Data. \nGET CHART DATA \nThe data underlying a chart can be exported as a table. All viewers of public dashboards and authenticated users of non-public dashboards can view and export data. To view the chart data, click Get Chart Data from the menu. Each row in the table represents a data point. \nIMPORTANT \nDATA TABLE DIFFERS FROM CHART VISUALIZATION Some configuration options you see reflected on a chart visualization are not applied to the data table. The Chart Data table displays underlying data retrieved with your full aggregation pipeline, and not all Chart Builder configuration options apply aggregation stages. Review your data to verify its contents. If you want to analyze your underlying data with a third-party tool, you can download your data from the Chart Data modal. To download your data, click Download - CSV or Download - JSON. \nNOTE You can also retrieve chart data using the Embedding SDK getData() method. To learn more about SDK API methods, see the Embedding SDK Reference.  \nEXPORT AND IMPORT A DASHBOARD \nYou can export a dashboard to a file, which you can then import.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nSAVE AND REUSE QUERIES \nThe Query Library allows you to reuse a query across multiple charts. If you save a query to the library, any user on your charts project can apply the same query on their own charts. Any changes to a query stored in the library impact all charts thar are connected to that query. \nSAVE AGGREGATION PIPELINE QUERIES \nAfter you apply an aggregation pipeline query to a chart, you can save it to the Query Library. This makes the query available for use on other charts created by you and other users on the same charts project. To save a query: 1 \nIN THE QUERY BAR FOR A CHART, INPUT A FIND() QUERY OR AN AGGREGATION PIPELINE AND CLICK APPLY. \nTo learn more, see Run Aggregation Pipelines on Your Data and Filter Your Data Using the Query Bar. 2 \nCLICK THE LIBRARY DROPDOWN NEXT TO THE QUERY BAR. \nThe Query Library menu contains options for saving and loading queries. 3 \nCHOOSE SAVE QUERY TO DISPLAY THE CONFIRMATION WINDOW. \n4 \nENTER A NAME FOR YOUR QUERY. \nThe Query title field shows the names of each existing query and the number of charts that use the query. You can enter a new name for your query or select an eisting query name to overwrite the existing query with your new query. If you enter a new name, you must also click Create <your-query-title> to create a named query in the library. If you select an existing query from the list, the field is pre-populated with the selected query name. If you save an existing query, all charts connected to that query will inherit the new query text. 5 \nCLICK SAVE TO SAVE THE QUERY TO THE QUERY LIBRARY.  LOAD SAVED QUERIES \nTo use a previously saved query from the Query Library on a chart, use the Library dropdown to load the saved query. You can access queries saved by any user in the project. To load saved queries: 1 \nCREATE A NEW CHART, OR CLICK THE EDIT BUTTON FOR THE CHART. \n2 \nCLICK THE LIBRARY DROPDOWN NEXT TO THE QUERY BAR. \nThe Query Library menu contains options for loading and saving queries. 3 \nCHOOSE LOAD QUERY FROM THE DROPDOWN TO DISPLAY THE LOAD QUERY PANE. \n4 \nCHOOSE THE SAVED QUERY TO RUN AGAINST YOUR DATA. \nBy default, the current data source is selected. It contains the list of queries applied to charts using the current data source only. You can choose Any data source to select from all saved queries in the library. 5 \nBROWSE THE LIST OF SAVED QUERIES. \nIn the Load Query pane, the queries are listed in alphabetical order and are case insensitive. For each query, you can see the name of the query, the start of the query, and the number of charts that use the query. Also, you can do the following:      * Hover over the tooltip icon to see the query owner and when the query was last modified.  * Click x to close the library pane. To learn more about all other actions that you can perform on the saved queries, see Manage Saved Queries. 6 \nCLICK LOAD FOR THE QUERY YOU WISH TO LOAD IN THE QUERY BAR. \nAfter loading a query, you can run the query against the data in the chart. Also, you can modify or disconnect the query from the library. To learn more, see Modify or Disconnect Saved Queries. \nMODIFY OR DISCONNECT SAVED QUERIES \nAfter you load a saved query, you can modify or disconnect the query from the library. To modify, make changes to the query in the query bar and save the query under its original name, only if you created the query or have the Project Owner role, or save the query under a new name. If you save the modified query under the same name, all other charts using the same named query will inherit the modified query for reuse.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nEMBED A CHART AUTHENTICATED WITH ATLAS APP SERVICES \nOn this page    \n * Prerequisites\n   \n * Procedures\n * Enable Authenticated Embedding for a Chart\n * Configure Charts to use your Custom Atlas App Services Provider\n * Create a Web App to Display Your Chart\n * Customize the Node.js App Atlas App Services is a serverless platform that enables developers to quickly build applications without having to set up server infrastructure. App Services offers several authentication options, including Google OAuth, Facebook Login, and email/password. You can use the authentication mechanism from an app service to control data access for an embedded chart. This tutorial shows you how to:      * Enable authenticated embedding for a chart.  * Use the Embedding SDK to embed a chart authenticated by a custom Atlas App Services provider.  * Use your app service to control the data in your embedded chart. \nNOTE This tutorial does not cover creating an app service with authentication. See the Atlas App Services documentation for app creation tutorials. \nPREREQUISITES \n * You must be an Atlas Project Owner to configure embedding authentication providers for your linked Charts instance.  * You must have a chart which uses your app's backing database as its data source. For more information about creating a chart, see Build Charts. \nPROCEDURES  ENABLE AUTHENTICATED EMBEDDING FOR A CHART \nEnable authenticated embedding to generate a Charts Base URL and a chart ID. You will need your Charts Base URL and chart ID to display your chart on a web page. 1 SELECT A DASHBOARD. \nFrom your dashboard page, select the dashboard containing the chart you wish to embed. 2 SELECT A CHART. \nFrom the dashboard, click at the top-right of the chart to access its embedding information. Select Embed chart from the dropdown menu. \nNOTE If a chart is on a dashboard that has embedding enabled, the Embed Chart option is automatically enabled. Therefore, you can't select the Embed chart option for charts within dashboards that have embedding enabled. 3 ENABLE EXTERNAL SHARING ON THE DATA SOURCE \nIf you have already enabled external sharing on the data source this chart uses, skip this step.

Click the Configure external sharing link. 4 SELECT THE AUTHENTICATED TAB IN THE DIALOG WINDOW.  5 TOGGLE ENABLE AUTHENTICATED ACCESS TO ON. \n6 (OPTIONAL) SPECIFY A FILTER FUNCTION TO INJECT PER USER. \nYou can specify a function to inject a MongoDB filter document for each user who views the chart. This is useful for rendering user-specific charts. \nEXAMPLE The following filter function only renders data where the ownerId field of a document matches the value of the Embedding Authentication Provider's token's sub field: function getFilter(context) {  return { ownerId: context.token.sub };}  \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: To learn more about injecting filters per user, see Inject User-Specific Filters. 7 (OPTIONAL) SPECIFY FILTERABLE FIELDS FOR YOUR CHART. \nSpecify the fields on which chart viewers can filter data. By default, no fields are specified, meaning the chart cannot be filtered until you explicitly allow at least one field. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: To learn more about filterable fields, see Specify Filterable Fields. 8 COPY THE CHART BASE URL AND CHART ID \nUse these values in your application code together with your Embedded Authentication Provider attributes to embed your chart. \nCONFIGURE CHARTS TO USE YOUR CUSTOM ATLAS APP SERVICES PROVIDER \n1 GO TO THE AUTHENTICATION SETTINGS VIEW. \n a.

When this option is enabled, any App Services rules defined on collections will be observed by Charts when retrieving chart data. You can use this feature to restrict access to the data shown on your chart, including showing different subsets of data to different users, depending on their role. \nNOTE  * This option assumes that the data source for this chart uses the same MongoDB database and collection as your app service.  * Using this option may have a performance impact, so you should leave it off if you do not need to restrict data access based on App Services rules. 8 ENTER SERVICE NAME. \nEnter the name of the service that fetches data from MongoDB. To find the name of your data service:  a. Navigate to your app service.  b. Click Clusters in the sidebar navigation.  c. The service name is listed under App Service Name. 9 CLICK THE SAVE BUTTON.  CREATE A WEB APP TO DISPLAY YOUR CHART \nIf you already have an app in which to display your chart, you're ready to add an embedded chart. If not, proceed with the remaining steps to create a new app. MongoDB offers a pre-built example app that shows how to use the Embedding SDK to display an embedded chart using App Services authentication. Clone the GitHub repository and follow the instructions in the Readme file to begin using the app. You can run the app as-is, or you can customize it to use the chart you created earlier. \nNOTE The example app assumes that your app service uses email/password authentication. If your app service uses another authentication mechanism, the example app will require additional customization. \nCUSTOMIZE THE NODE.JS APP \nAll the lines you need to edit are marked with a comment containing ~REPLACE~. 1 OPEN THE FILE INDEX.JS IN A TEXT EDITOR. \nThe file index.js is located in the src directory. 2 ENTER YOUR APP ID \nReplace the existing App ID with your App ID, which you can find on the left side of your app service UI. const client = Stitch.initializeAppClient(  'authentication-sample-eibkj', // Optional: ~REPLACE~ with your  App ID{ 3 ENTER YOUR CHARTS BASE URL \nReplace the existing Charts Base URL with the Base URL of the chart you want to display. Your Charts Base URL is visible in the embedding options modal window. See Embedding SDK for detailed instructions on enabling embedding for a chart. const sdk = new ChartsEmbedSDK({  baseUrl: \"https://charts-dev.mongodb.com/charts-test2-pebbp\", // Optional: ~REPLACE~ with your Charts URL  getUserToken: () => getRealmUserToken(client),}); Note the getRealmUserToken() function in the code snippet above, which returns the JWT from the existing Atlas App Services authentication session. getRealmUserToken() must be imported from the Embedding SDK, as you can see in the import statement on line 2 of the example app: import ChartsEmbedSDK, { getRealmUserToken } from \"@mongodb-js/charts-embed-dom\"; You can also include the Embedding SDK with inline Javascript in an HTML page, as shown in the following code snippet: <script src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/js/bundles/4.6.0/stitch.js\"></script><script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@mongodb-js/charts-embed-dom\"></script>  To use the getRealmUserToken() function in this scenario, import it from the SDK: ChartsEmbedSDK.getRealmUserToken() \n4 ENTER YOUR CHART ID \nReplace the existing chart ID with the ID of the chart you want to display. Your chart ID is visible in the embedding options modal window. See Embedding SDK for detailed instructions on enabling embedding for a chart. const chart = sdk.createChart({  chartId: \"a2e775e6-f267-4c2c-a65d-fbf3fad4a4f2\", // Optional: ~REPLACE~ with your

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nCALCULATE NEW DATA FIELDS \nOn this page    \n * Considerations\n   \n * Create a Calculated Field\n * Edit a Calculated Field\n * Remove a Calculated Field You can combine data from one or more fields in your collection into a single calculated field. For example, you can:      * Convert a field in hours to seconds or in degrees Farenheit to Celsius  * Multiply a price field by a quantity field to create a total  * Combine multiple line items within an array to calculate a total \nCONSIDERATIONS \n * You can only create calculated fields from data within the same document.  * You can't convert the type of a calculated field through the MongoDB Charts interface. However, you can use Type Expression Operators in a calculated field's definition.  * Once you create a calculated field, you can modify its definition but not its name. However, you can remove and recreate the field if you need to rename it. \nCREATE A CALCULATED FIELD \nYou create a calculated field by combining the data of existing fields through simple expressions or MQL Operator Expressions. \nNOTE The definition of a calculated field can contain either simple expression language or operator expression language. You can't use both simple and operator expression language in the same definition. To create a calculated field:  1. In the corner of the Fields pane, click Add Field.  2. Select Calculated.  3. Enter the Field Name of the calculated field you want to define. You can specify a nested field by using dot notation. For example, metadata.target.  4. Enter the Value Expression using simple expression language or Operator Expressions.  5. Click Save Field. The calculated field appears in italics in the Fields pane. \nSIMPLE EXPRESSIONS \nYou can use the following simple expression language in a calculated field. Expression Language\nExample\nField names\norderTotal\n'orderTotal'\n\"orderTotal\"\nLiteral numbers\n2\n0.5\nMathematical operators\n+\n-\n*\n/\nBrackets\n( ) Whitespace that is outside of quoted strings is not included in the expression.  \nEXAMPLE The following examples are valid simple expressions to define a calculated field. Add the bathrooms field to the bedrooms field: bathrooms + bedrooms  Multiply the total amount field by 1.1: 'total amount' * 1.1  Subtract 32 from the sensor.temp field, then multiply by 5 and divide by 9: (sensor.temp - 32)*5/9  \nOPERATOR EXPRESSIONS \nYou can use Operator Expressions to define more complex calculated fields. \nEXAMPLE The following examples are valid operator expressions to define a calculated field. Multiply the price field by 0.075: { $multiply: [ \"$price\", 0.075 ] }  Combine multiple line items fields in an array to calculate a total: { $reduce: {  input: '$items', initialValue: 0,  in: { $sum : [\"$$value\",    { $multiply: [\"$$this.price\",      \"$$this.quantity\"] }  ] } } }  \nTIP You can use a calculated field in the definition of another calculated field. For example, if you create a salesTax calculated field with the following definition: { $multiply: [ \"$price\", 0.075 ] }  You can then create a totalCost calculated field that uses the salesTax field in its definition: { $sum: [\"$price\", \"$salesTax\"] }  \nLITERAL STRINGS \nYou can set a calculated field's value to a string using the $literal operator. \nEXAMPLE The following field definition assigns a value of my string: { $literal: \"my string\" }  \nEDIT A CALCULATED FIELD \nYou can modify the definition of a calculated field.  1. In the Fields pane, click the Ellipsis (...) next to the name of the calculated field you want to modify.  2. Select Modify field.  3. Update the Value Expression.  4. Click Save Field. If you are using the calculated field in a chart, the chart refreshes to reflect the new calculated field definition.  \nREMOVE A CALCULATED FIELD \nWhen you remove a calculated field, MongoDB Charts resamples the data source, updates the Fields pane, and refreshes your chart. If the calculated field was used in encodings or filters, it remains in the chart even after the field is removed from the Fields pane.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nEMBED AN AUTHENTICATED CHART USING A CUSTOM JWT PROVIDER \nOn this page    \n * Prerequisites\n   \n * Procedures\n * Enable Authenticated Embedding for a Chart\n * Configure Charts to use your Custom JWT Provider\n * Create a Web App to Display your Chart\n * Customize the Node.js App Many websites use authentication systems that generate JWTs to represent a signed-in user. If your website produces JWTs, you can configure Charts to validate the existing tokens to authorize the rendering of embedded charts. Alternatively, if your site does not already use JWTs as a part of the authentication process, you can write code to generate JWTs explicitly for the purpose of authorizing chart renders. This tutorial shows the latter approach. The example shows you how to generate a simple JWT for a logged in user and send it to Charts. Charts uses the details you provided when you configure a provider to validate JWTs it receives with requests to render embedded charts. If the token is invalid or does not conform to the details you provided, Charts doesn't render the authenticated chart view. \nPREREQUISITES \n     * You must be an Atlas Project Owner to configure embedding authentication providers for your linked Charts instance.  * Create a New Dashboard  * Create a Chart \nPROCEDURES  ENABLE AUTHENTICATED EMBEDDING FOR A CHART \nEnable authenticated embedding to generate a Charts Base URL and a chart ID. You will need your Charts Base URL and chart ID to display your chart on a web page. 1 SELECT A DASHBOARD. \nFrom your dashboard page, select the dashboard containing the chart you wish to embed. 2 SELECT A CHART. \nFrom the dashboard, click at the top-right of the chart to access its embedding information. Select Embed chart from the dropdown menu. \nNOTE If a chart is on a dashboard that has embedding enabled, the Embed Chart option is automatically enabled. Therefore, you can't select the Embed chart option for charts within dashboards that have embedding enabled. 3 ENABLE EXTERNAL SHARING ON THE DATA SOURCE \nIf you have already enabled external sharing on the data source this chart uses, skip this step. If you haven't yet enabled embedding on the data source, you can do so now. Click the Configure external sharing link. 4 SELECT THE AUTHENTICATED TAB IN THE DIALOG WINDOW.  5 TOGGLE ENABLE AUTHENTICATED ACCESS TO ON. \n6 (OPTIONAL) SPECIFY A FILTER FUNCTION TO INJECT PER USER. \nYou can specify a function to inject a MongoDB filter document for each user who views the chart. This is useful for rendering user-specific charts. \nEXAMPLE The following filter function only renders data where the ownerId field of a document matches the value of the Embedding Authentication Provider's token's sub field: function getFilter(context) {  return { ownerId: context.token.sub };}  \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: To learn more about injecting filters per user, see Inject User-Specific Filters. 7 (OPTIONAL) SPECIFY FILTERABLE FIELDS FOR YOUR CHART. \nSpecify the fields on which chart viewers can filter data. By default, no fields are specified, meaning the chart cannot be filtered until you explicitly allow at least one field. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: To learn more about filterable fields, see Specify Filterable Fields. 8 COPY THE CHART BASE URL AND CHART ID \nUse these values in your application code together with your Embedded Authentication Provider attributes to embed your chart. \nCONFIGURE CHARTS TO USE YOUR CUSTOM JWT PROVIDER  NOTE When you configure authentication using a custom JWT provider, you can choose the signing algorithm. This tutorial uses the HS256 signing algorithm. If you select the RS256 signing algorithm, you can also choose one of the following signing keys:  * JSON web key (JWK) or JSON web key set (JWKS) URL: Charts retrieves the key from the JWK or JWKS file at the specified URL. Charts then uses the key to validate the JSON web token. If there are multiple keys in the file, Charts tries each key until it finds a match.  * PEM public key: Charts uses the specified public key to verify the JSON web token. 1 GO TO THE AUTHENTICATION SETTINGS VIEW. \n a.

The app.js file in the sample application uses a simple web service and the jsonwebtoken package to generate and return a JWT signed using the HS256 algorithm when a user logs in to the application with these credentials:  * User name: admin  * Password: password 1const express = require(\"express\");2const bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\");3const cors = require(\"cors\");4const jwt = require(\"jsonwebtoken\");5const config = require(\"./config.js\");6\n7const app = express();8const port = 8000;9\n10// Configuring body parser middleware11app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));12app.use(bodyParser.json());13app.use(cors());14\n15app.post(\"/login\", (req, res) => {16  const loginDetails = req.body;17  // mock a check against the database18  let mockedUsername = \"admin\";19  let mockedPassword = \"password\";20\n21  if (22    loginDetails &&23    loginDetails.username === mockedUsername &&24    loginDetails.password === mockedPassword25  ) {26    let token = jwt.sign({ username: loginDetails.username }, config.secret, {27      expiresIn: \"24h\" // expires in 24 hours28    });29    res.json({ bearerToken: token });30  } else {31    res.status(401).send(false);32  }33});34\n35app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`));  \nNOTE Your application must handle refreshing or issuing new tokens before they expire.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nCREATE AND MANAGE CHARTS VIEWS \nOn this page    \n * Use Cases\n   \n * Create a Charts View from a Collection\n * Example Pipelines\n * Modify a Charts View's Pipeline\n * Disconnect a Charts View\n * Delete a Charts View If you are the Project Owner, you can create and modify a charts view. A charts view is a data source that applies an aggregation pipeline to a collection to pre-process data before it is used for Charts. You can create multiple charts views from a single collection. After you create a charts view, you can select the charts view as a data source when you create a chart. \nUSE CASES \nPre-processing a data source with a pipeline is useful when your collection data is not optimized for data visualization. Pre-processing your data can help accomplish the following tasks:      * Join data from multiple collections into a single data source using $lookup. See example.  * Hide fields which may contain sensitive data from Charts users using $project. See example.  * Convert data types, such as a string field to a date. See example. \nCREATE A CHARTS VIEW FROM A COLLECTION \n1 \nCONNECT YOUR DEPLOYMENT. \nTo learn more, see Connect a Deployment to Charts. 2 \nSELECT A DATABASE AND COLLECTION. \n a. In the deployment's Data Access section, click the name of the database that contains the collection to use for the charts view. The collections list appears.  b. Click the collection to use for the charts view. Charts also displays any existing charts views that use the collection. 3 \nCLICK CHARTS VIEW NEXT TO THE COLLECTION'S INFORMATION. \nCharts opens the Add Charts View modal. 4 \nSPECIFY A NAME FOR YOUR CHARTS VIEW. \n5 \nADD AN AGGREGATION PIPELINE. \nYour pipeline must be an array. Specify each stage of your pipeline as an object within the array. 6 \n(OPTIONAL) CLICK TEST PIPELINE. \nMongoDB Charts validates your pipeline. Charts reports any errors in your pipeline below the editor. If the pipeline is valid, Charts shows a sample document from the results or displays No documents returned. \nTIP For help creating your pipeline, you can utilize the Aggregation Pipeline Builder in the Atlas Data Explorer. You can create your pipeline using the Atlas pipeline builder and paste it into the MongoDB Charts pipeline editor. 7 \nCLICK SAVE. \nAfter you save the charts view, it displays in the Data Access section for the collection it uses. \nEXAMPLE PIPELINES  JOIN DATA FROM TWO COLLECTIONS \nThe following example adds a pipeline to a data source pointing to the sample_mflix.movies collection from the Sample Mflix Dataset provided by Atlas. The pipeline performs a $lookup to join data from the comments collection based on movie_id. The result is a new field in this data source called comments containing data from a separate collection. [ {   $lookup:     {       from: 'comments',       localField: '_id',       foreignField: 'movie_id',       as: 'comments'     } }]  \nHIDE SENSITIVE DATA \nThe following example adds a pipeline to a data source pointing to the sample_supplies.sales collection from the Sample Supply Store Dataset provided by Atlas. The pipeline hides the customer.email field, making that field unavailable to charts using this data source: [  {    $project: { \"customer.email\": 0 }  }]  To learn more about the $project aggregation stage, see $project. \nCONVERT THE TYPE OF A DATA FIELD \nThe following example adds a pipeline to a data source containing a string field that we want to convert to a date. The pipeline adds a new field to the data source with the string field saleDate converted to a date field called saleDateAsDate: [  {    $addFields: {      saleDateAsDate: { $toDate: '$saleDate' }

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nEMBED A CHART AUTHENTICATED WITH GOOGLE SIGN-IN \nOn this page    \n * Prerequisites\n   \n * Procedures\n * Enable Authenticated Embedding for your Chart\n * Create a Google Client ID\n * Configure Charts to use Google Sign-In\n * Create a Web App to Display Your Chart\n * Customize the Node.js App This tutorial shows you how to configure a sample application to render an embedded, Google-authenticated chart on a web page. Users must sign in with their Google account to view the chart. If a user doesn't sign in with Google, Charts doesn't render the authenticated chart view. \nPREREQUISITES \n     * You must be an Atlas Project Owner to configure embedding authentication providers for your linked Charts instance.  * Create a New Dashboard  * Create a Chart \nPROCEDURES  ENABLE AUTHENTICATED EMBEDDING FOR YOUR CHART \nEnable authenticated embedding to generate a Charts Base URL and a chart ID. You will need your Charts Base URL and chart ID to display your chart on a web page. 1 SELECT A DASHBOARD. \nFrom your dashboard page, select the dashboard containing the chart you wish to embed. 2 SELECT A CHART. \nFrom the dashboard, click at the top-right of the chart to access its embedding information. Select Embed chart from the dropdown menu. \nNOTE If a chart is on a dashboard that has embedding enabled, the Embed Chart option is automatically enabled. Therefore, you can't select the Embed chart option for charts within dashboards that have embedding enabled. 3 ENABLE EXTERNAL SHARING ON THE DATA SOURCE \nIf you have already enabled external sharing on the data source this chart uses, skip this step. If you haven't yet enabled embedding on the data source, you can do so now. Click the Configure external sharing link. 4 SELECT THE AUTHENTICATED TAB IN THE DIALOG WINDOW.  5 TOGGLE ENABLE AUTHENTICATED ACCESS TO ON. \n6 (OPTIONAL) SPECIFY A FILTER FUNCTION TO INJECT PER USER. \nYou can specify a function to inject a MongoDB filter document for each user who views the chart. This is useful for rendering user-specific charts. \nEXAMPLE The following filter function only renders data where the ownerId field of a document matches the value of the Embedding Authentication Provider's token's sub field: function getFilter(context) {  return { ownerId: context.token.sub };}  \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: To learn more about injecting filters per user, see Inject User-Specific Filters. 7 (OPTIONAL) SPECIFY FILTERABLE FIELDS FOR YOUR CHART. \nSpecify the fields on which chart viewers can filter data. By default, no fields are specified, meaning the chart cannot be filtered until you explicitly allow at least one field. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: To learn more about filterable fields, see Specify Filterable Fields. 8 COPY THE CHART BASE URL AND CHART ID \nUse these values in your application code together with your Embedded Authentication Provider attributes to embed your chart. \nCREATE A GOOGLE CLIENT ID \nCreate a Google API Console project to generate a Google Client ID. You will need your Google Client ID to configure Charts to use Google Sign-In. To create a Google API Console project, see Integrating Google Sign-In into your web app. \nCONFIGURE CHARTS TO USE GOOGLE SIGN-IN \n1 GO TO THE AUTHENTICATION SETTINGS VIEW. \n a. If Charts is not already displayed, click Charts in the navigation bar.  b. Click Embedding in the sidebar.  c. Click the Authentication Settings tab. 2 FROM THE AUTHENTICATION PROVIDERS SECTION, CLICK ADD. \n3 IN THE NAME FIELD, ENTER A DESCRIPTIVE NAME FOR THE PROVIDER. \n4 FROM THE PROVIDER LIST, SELECT GOOGLE. \n5 IN THE GOOGLE CLIENT ID FIELD, ENTER THE GOOGLE CLIENT ID YOU CREATED. \n6 CLICK SAVE.

If you select infinity, your chart doesn't automatically refresh.  5. Click Save. \nMANUALLY REFRESH DATA \nYou can manually refresh an entire dashboard or individual charts to render your charts with the latest data.

These settings are not persisted with the dashboard or shared between users.  * Hover over the timer at the bottom of the chart to view more information.\n   \n   \n   \n   What you see depends on where you view the chart and if the last refresh failed:\n   \n   Viewing Method\n   Details You See\n   Authenticated Dashboard\n   \n    * The error code that describes why the refresh failed, if applicable.\n   \n    * Time since the last refresh occurred.\n   \n    * Time until the next automatic refresh occurs.\n   \n   Dashboard Accessed with a Public Link\n   \n    * Time since the last refresh occurred.\n   \n    * Time until the next automatic refresh occurs.\n   \n   Embedded using an iframe or the SDK\n   \n    * The embedding error code that describes why the refresh failed, if applicable.\n   \n    * If the chart is configured to automatically refresh: - Time since the last refresh occurred. - Time until the next automatic refresh occurs. \nCACHING BEHAVIOR \nWhen MongoDB Charts loads charts on a dashboard, it does not consistently query the data source for each chart. Instead, MongoDB Charts queries the data sources when the dashboard first loads, and that data is cached on both the client and server. \nNOTE The data stored in the cache is encrypted with a key

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nCREATE A MULTI-SERIES CHART \nOn this page    \n * Map Multiple Fields to a Single Axis\n   \n * Series Field\n * count by value Aggregation Option MongoDB Charts supports building multi-series charts, which split your chart data into groups, or series, to compare additional fields within your schema. There are two ways to create multi-series charts:      * Map Multiple Fields to a Single Axis. Use this method to compare or aggregate upon multiple non-categorical fields in the schema.  * Using the Series field in the chart builder. Use this method when grouping data based on a discrete list of items. \nMAP MULTIPLE FIELDS TO A SINGLE AXIS \nMongoDB Charts allows you to map multiple Aggregation or Value fields to a single chart property (such as the X Axis or Y Axis). This allows you to compare additional fields by creating new series based on the encoding channels added. After dragging a field to an aggregation or value encoding channel, an additional optional encoding channel of the same type appears below the one which was just added, allowing you to add additional series to your visualization. This process repeats with each channel you add, so you can map as many fields as desired to your chart. \nEXAMPLE The following multi-series column chart shows average movie ratings by genre from two different sources: IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes:  There are two aggregation encoding channels on the chart's Y Axis, one for each of the site's rating fields. By selecting the mean aggregation option, the chart aggregates these two fields using the $avg operator to provide a comparison of the average of two fields in the same column. \nTIP Use multiple field mappings to create a multi-series chart when the values being compared in the visualization come from two or more separate fields in the schema. In the example above, there is one series for Rotten Tomato ratings and one series for IMDB ratings. Since these are separate fields within the schema, adding multiple aggregation encoding channels to map the data is the best choice to compare the fields. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: If you omit the Category field, you can create a single-series chart based on your selected aggregated fields. To learn more, see Create a Single-Series Chart with Multiple Aggregations. \nUSE A SECONDARY Y AXIS \nIf you map multiple Aggregation or Value fields to the Y axis, you can plot one set of values on a secondary Y axis. \nSERIES FIELD \nYou can also create multi-series charts by using the Series field in the chart builder. The Series field differs from aggregation encoding channels because it instead utilizes a Category encoding channel instead of a Value or Aggregation channel. When creating a series using the Category encoding channel, each unique value from the data field becomes a series in the visualization. \nEXAMPLE The following multi-series column chart shows order data from an office supply store, showing the most common items sold by store location:  By using the item.name in the Series encoding channel, a series within each location group is added for each item name. \nTIP The Series field is useful when you are grouping data based on a discrete list of items. This approach should be used when the values for all series are stored in a single field, with a separate field used to establish the discrete categories. \nCOUNT BY VALUE AGGREGATION OPTION \nWhen you drag a field onto an aggregation channel, you can select the count by value option to create a multi-series chart based on the values contained in the field. A series is automatically created for each unique value from the field, with the chart value representing the number of occurrences. Your chart can display multiple count by value fields with additional aggregations, as long as there is no field mapped to the category axis. \nNOTE If any field in the X or Y axis channel has the count by value aggregation selected, the Series channel is disabled, and any field previously mapped to that channel is removed. \nEXAMPLE The following multi-series bar chart uses the sample_airbnb database. It groups listings by the number of beds and the number of bedrooms they have, showing the total number of listings for each value.  You can also create a multi-series chart with a count by value aggregation channel and a category axis channel. \nEXAMPLE The following multi-series stacked column chart uses the sample_airbnb database. It shows all the different suburbs of Turkey with the number of each distinct type of property located there.

dashboard, you can interact with a chart that has Filter or highlight enabled to filter data in other charts. With Filter or highlight enabled, clicking a chart element with an associated dashboard filter temporarily reconfigures the scope of that dashboard filter to a single chart series, category or field value. Interactive filtering is useful for getting quick insights into subcategories of your data on dashboards with multiple charts. Interactive filtering is temporary; you can revert to your original dashboard filter at any time. To enable Filter or highlight:       1. Hover over the chart on the dashboard to reveal four buttons in the upper right corner of the chart.  2. Click the second button for Interactive Filters.  3. Select Filter or highlight from the dropdown. \nNOTE By default, charts set Interactive Filters to Filter or highlight. Setting a chart's Interactive Filters to Filter reflects dashboard filters and temporary interactive filters. That chart cannot be highlighted to set interactive filters on other charts. Setting a chart's Interactive Filters to Ignore ignores any dashboard or interactive filters. \nEXAMPLE On the MongoDB Charts Sample Dashboard, movie statistics are displayed across a range of chart types. If you create a dashboard filter for rated, the content rating of a movie (e.g. G, PG-13, R), you can click a specific movie rating on any one of your charts to temporarily reconfigure the scope of your dashboard filter to that specific movie rating. If you click on the PG-13 rating section of the Movie Ratings donut chart, the rest of the charts on your dashboard update to display only data for PG-13 movies. When you clear the selection of the PG-13 rating, your dashboard reverts to displaying charts according to the rated dashboard filter. The chart upon which you set an interactive filter is highlighted, not filtered. It emphasizes the element for which your other charts are filtered. You can clear the selection from that highlighted chart. A highlighted chart displays a status icon in the bottom left corner. Filtered charts display the icon. You can apply an interactive filter to all chart types except:  * Number Charts  * Gauge Charts  * Top Item Charts  * Geospatial Scatter Charts  * Geospatial Heatmaps \nFILTER A DASHBOARD BY A CHART ELEMENT \nTo interactively filter a dashboard based on a chart element, you must first create a dashboard filter for the field that you want to filter by. \nEXAMPLE To filter the Sample Dashboard to only English movies, you must have a dashboard filter on the language field. To filter a dashboard by a chart element, you can click on:  * a legend entry  * a chart category, such as an X or Y series label  * a chart mark, such as a bar segment or line chart node When you hover over a chart element with an associated dashboard filter, your cursor displays the icon. If a chart element isn't filterable, your cursor displays the icon. You might be able to add a dashboard filter for that value's field to make that element filterable. \nNOTE If the dashboard filter card associated with a clicked element is disabled, Charts enables it temporarily until you clear the selection of that element. When you filter a dashboard by a chart element, Charts disables all other dashboard filters until you clear the selection. \nREMOVE AN INTERACTIVE FILTER \nYou can remove an interactive dashboard filter by:  * Clicking the whitespace on the highlighted chart upon which you set the interactive filter, or  * Changing the associated dashboard filter. \nCLICK TO EMPHASIZE SERIES \nChart viewers can interact with a chart to highlight one or more series in a multi-series chart. This behavior applies to any chart type that displays a discrete color legend, except for geospatial charts. The following chart types support emphasizing specific series:  * Grouped and Stacked Bar/Column charts  * Discrete and Continuous Line/Area charts  * Scatter charts  * Donut charts \nEMPHASIZE A

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nFILTER DASHBOARDS BY FIELD VALUES \nOn this page    \n * Dashboard Filters\n   \n * Example Scenario\n * Filter Persistence Per Dashboard Viewer\n * The Dashboard Filters Pane\n * Expand or Collapse Dashboard Filters\n * Manage Dashboard Filters\n * Add Dashboard Filters\n * Edit Dashboard Filters\n * Delete Dashboard Filters\n * Disable Dashboard Filters for a Chart\n * Use Dashboard Filters\n * Filter Dashboards\n * Revert Dashboard Filters to Default Values \nDASHBOARD FILTERS \nDashboard filters refine data across some or all of the charts in a dashboard. They allow you to view a common subset of data across the dashboard's charts. Dashboard Authors or Owners can:      * Select the fields that all dashboard users can use to filter data.  * Set initial default values for each filter.  * Disable filtering for a specific chart. Disabling filtering exempts the chart from dashboard filters. All dashboard users can filter based on values they specify and save their own default filter values. \nNOTE Users who open a dashboard using a public link can't save their own default filter values. Charts reverts to the initial default filter values after refreshing the page or starting a new session.  If one or more dashboard filters affect the data a chart displays, an icon displays in the bottom left corner of that chart. Hover over the icon for a list of the filtered fields impacting that chart. \nNOTE Dashboard Authors or Owners define filters using specific data sources and can disable filtering on specific charts. A single filter might not refine all charts if:  * The dashboard contains charts mapped to data sources that the filter doesn't use.  * A dashboard Author or Owner disables filtering on some charts. \nEXAMPLE SCENARIO \nA dashboard Author creates a dashboard with charts that contain sales data for all of a company's customers. The author creates a filter allowing dashboard viewers to select which region(s) to display data from. Members of a sales team use this filter to display customer data only for the region(s) that they cover. \nTIP You can use a prebuilt sample dashboard to experiment with dashboard filters. \nFILTER PERSISTENCE PER DASHBOARD VIEWER \nCharts persists the following states for each dashboard viewer across reloads and user sessions:  * which filters are enabled or disabled  * field values chosen to filter dashboards  * whether the Dashboard Filters is expanded or collapsed. The changes that a dashboard viewer makes to filters don't affect other Charts users. A viewer's saved filters are not affected when a dashboard Author or Owner modifies a filter's default values unless you reset a filter. \nNOTE Charts doesn't persist filter states or values for users who open a dashboard using a public link. Charts reverts to the initial default filter values after refreshing the page or starting a new session. \nTHE DASHBOARD FILTERS PANE \nThe Dashboard Filters icon indicates the number of active filters. Click the icon to expand the Dashboard Filters pane.  The Dashboard Filters pane displays a filter card for each field you can use to filter chart data. You can configure filter cards to use related fields from multiple data sources. When you update a field value, Charts updates dashboard charts to display data that matches the field values you provide from all configured data sources. In the following example, a dashboard Author creates filters on the genres and year fields from two sample movie datasets. The Author sets default values for these fields to only display Science Fiction and History movies released in or after 1968. Dashboard Viewers can provide their own values for the filterable fields to refine chart data based on their interests.  To learn about filtering options for each field data type, see Create Filters for Your Data. \nEXPAND OR COLLAPSE DASHBOARD FILTERS \nYou can expand or collapse dashboard filter cards by clicking Show or Hide on that card. Disabled filters are automatically collapsed. Enabled, collapsed filters are still applied to your charts. \nMANAGE DASHBOARD FILTERS \nDashboard Authors and Owners can:  * Add, edit, and delete dashboard filters.  * Disable dashboard filters on specific charts. \nADD DASHBOARD FILTERS \nYou can specify fields that any dashboard users can filter data with. When you create a dashboard filter, you select related fields from the data sources that a dashboard chart uses. You can add dashboard filters based on any number of data sources that a dashboard chart uses.

When a filter affects chart A, the query for that chart uses field A only. When a filter affects chart B, the query for that chart uses field B only. To add a dashboard filter:  1. Expand the Dashboard Filters pane on the desired dashboard.  2. If a dashboard has no filers, click Add Filters. Otherwise, click Edit.  3. Expand a data source that contains fields you want to add a filter for.  4. Drag a field from the data source to the + filter drop zone.\n    \n    \n    TIP\n    \n    To search for specific data fields, use the search bar at the upper left corner of the Edit Dashboard Filters pane.\n    \n    The data source name appears below the field name in the filter card.  5. (Optional) You can stack fields from other data sources. This allows you to use a single filter to refine chart data from related fields from multiple data sources.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    \n    TO STACK FIELDS IN A FILTER CARD:\n    \n     * Each field must be of the same data type as the other fields on the filter card.\n    \n     * The filter card must not have another field from the selected data source on it.\n    \n    To stack fields from other data sources:\n    \n    a. Expand another data source that contains a related field.\n    \n    b. Drag a field from the data source to the + another field drop zone on the same filter card.\n    \n    The data source name appears below the field name and the other data sources you selected fields from in the filter card.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    The field names might differ from each data source. The filter card lists the field name you used to create the filter.\n    \n    Click next to a data source to remove its field from a filter card.  6. (Optional) Supply default values for the field in the filter card. All dashboard viewers see chart data that matches the default field values you provide until they provide their own filter values or disable the filter card.\n    \n    The filter card options are based on the data type of the field.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nUNDERSTAND ENCODING CHANNELS \nOn this page    \n * Encoding Channel Types\n   \n * Aggregation\n * Geopoint Channel Type\n * Add Missing Fields in the Chart Builder Encoding channels are the building blocks of your visualizations. These channels are the means by which Charts translates data from your collection to the visualization. The encoding process dictates how that data appears in the chart based on the channel type selected. \nENCODING CHANNEL TYPES \nEach encoding channel type provides different capabilities for processing and visualizing your data. Each channel type accepts distinct data types (e.g., string versus numeric data). The following table describes each encoding channel type in MongoDB Charts: Encoding Channel Type\nDescription\nValue\nA point on the chart is created from the chosen field for each document in the collection. You may only assign fields with a numeric or date type to a Value channel.\nCategory Each unique value from this field in the collection is used as a chart category. The Category encoding channel provides the following additional visualization options:      * For fields with a string data type, you can specify a field to sort on and the sort order.  * For fields with a numeric data type, you can toggle data binning and select the bin size.  * For fields with a date data type, you can toggle date grouping and select the grouping period. Aggregation\nA point on the chart is created by applying an aggregation function over the values of this field from multiple documents. For more information on using aggregation functions in Charts, see Aggregation Options.\nGeopoint When you create a chart using a geopoint channel type, MongoDB Charts renders a map to visualize your data. A mark is plotted on the map for each document containing the selected field based on the field's latitude and longitude values. Geopoint channel types are used in the Coordinates channel on Geospatial Scatter and Geospatial Heatmap chart types. For more information on the geopoint encoding channel type, refer to the Geopoint Channel Type section. Charts shows required encoding channels in green, and optional encoding channels in blue. \nAGGREGATION \nDragging a field onto an aggregation encoding channel allows you to use an aggregation pipeline operator on that field. For a list of the available aggregation pipeline operators in Charts, see Aggregation Options. \nEXAMPLE Donut charts provide two encoding channels:  * A category channel called Label dictating which field to use when dividing the sections of the chart.  * An aggregation channel called Arc dictating the aggregation operation to perform on the Label category. The following donut chart examines NASA's Landslide data source to show the frequency of various landslide triggers by performing a $count aggregation on the trigger field:  We see from the chart that the most common landslide trigger is Downpour followed by Rain. \nGEOPOINT CHANNEL TYPE \nGeopoint channel types are used in the Coordinates channel on Geospatial Scatter and Geospatial Heatmap chart types. Geospatial charts visualize data that references specific geographic locations. MongoDB Charts automatically determines which fields in your dataset, if any, are GeoJSON Points. Charts signifies these fields with a icon. You can map these fields directly to a geopoint channel type by dragging them onto an appropriate geopoint channel type in the chart builder. Charts automatically determines the latitude and longitude values from the field and adds a point to the map for each document. \nNOTE You can also assign numeric coordinates or arrays to a geopoint channel type to specify latitude and longitude not stored as GeoJSON Points. For details on this process, see the following section. \nASSIGN NON-GEOJSON FIELDS TO A GEOPOINT CHANNEL TYPE \nThis section describes how to use fields not stored as GeoJSON Points in a geopoint channel type.  * You can drag numeric fields onto a geopoint channel type to specify latitude and longitude. When you drag a numeric field onto a geopoint channel type, the channel updates to use the selected field as either Latitude or Longitude. Charts prompts you for a second numeric field to fill in the other value.  * Alternatively, you can drag a numeric array onto a geopoint channel type to specify location coordinates from a field. When you use this approach, you can specify which indexes of the array to use for latitude and longitude components.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nEMBED AN UNAUTHENTICATED CHART \nOn this page    \n * Prerequisites\n   \n * Procedures\n * Enable Unauthenticated Embedding for a Chart\n * Create a Web App to Display Your Chart\n * Customize the Node.js App You can embed a chart in a web application and not require authentication to view chart data. To restrict access to your embedded chart, see the authenticated embedded chart tutorials. \nPREREQUISITES \n     * You must be a dashboard Author to enable unauthenticated embedding for a chart.  * Create a New Dashboard  * Create a Chart \nPROCEDURES  ENABLE UNAUTHENTICATED EMBEDDING FOR A CHART \nEnable unauthenticated embedding to generate a chart ID and Charts Base URL. You will need your chart ID and Charts Base URL to display your chart on a web page. 1 SELECT A DASHBOARD. \nFrom your dashboard page, select the dashboard containing the chart you wish to make embeddable. 2 SELECT A CHART. \nFrom the dashboard, click at the top-right of the chart to access its embedding information. Select Embed chart from the dropdown menu. \nNOTE If a chart is on a dashboard that has embedding enabled, the Embed Chart option is automatically enabled. Therefore, you can't select the Embed chart option for charts within dashboards that have embedding enabled. 3 ENABLE EXTERNAL SHARING ON THE DATA SOURCE. \nIf you have already enabled external sharing on the data source this chart uses, skip this step. If you haven't yet enabled embedding on the data source, you can do so now. Click the Configure external sharing link. 4 SELECT THE UNAUTHENTICATED TAB IN THE DIALOG WINDOW.  5 TOGGLE ENABLE UNAUTHENTICATED ACCESS TO ON. \n6 (OPTIONAL) SPECIFY FILTERABLE FIELDS FOR YOUR CHART. \nSpecify the fields on which chart viewers can filter data. By default, no fields are specified, meaning the chart cannot be filtered until you explicitly allow at least one field. Alternatively, you can specify all the fields in your chart by selecting Allow all fields in the data source used in this chart. To learn more about filterable fields, see Specify Filterable Fields. 7 SELECT THE JAVASCRIPT SDK PANEL. \n8 COPY THE CHARTS BASE URL AND CHART ID. \nYou'll need the Charts Base URl and Chart ID values in your web application code. \nCREATE A WEB APP TO DISPLAY YOUR CHART \nIf you already have an app in which to display your chart, you're ready to add an unauthenticated embedded chart. If not, proceed with the remaining steps to create a new app. MongoDB offers a pre-built example app in the GitHub repository that shows how to use the Embedding SDK to display an unauthenticated embedded chart. Clone the GitHub repository to get all the example apps. Instructions for running the unauthenticated example are in the Readme file in the unauthenticated directory. You can run the app as-is, or you can customize it to use a chart of your own. \nCUSTOMIZE THE NODE.JS APP \nAll the lines you need to edit are marked with a comment containing ~REPLACE~. 1 OPEN THE FILE INDEX.JS IN A TEXT EDITOR. \nThe file index.js is located in the src directory. 2 ENTER YOUR CHARTS BASE URL \nReplace the existing Charts Base URL with the Base URL of the chart you want to display. Your Charts Base URL is visible in the embedding options modal window. See Embedding SDK for detailed instructions on enabling embedding for a chart. const sdk = new ChartsEmbedSDK({  baseUrl: \"https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-embedding-examples-wgffp\" // Optional: ~REPLACE~ with the Base URL from your Embed Chart dialog}); You can also include the Embedding SDK with inline Javascript in an HTML page, as shown in the following code snippet: <script

Element\n * Examples\n * Basic Handling of Click Events\n * Interactive Filtering for Click Events \nNOTE Click Events in the Charts Embedding SDK is available in version 2.1.0 and later. The Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK includes a click event handler that allows you to subscribe to click events. When you click on a particular element on your chart, the click event handler captures details of the element that you clicked. Use this feature to build interactive experiences similar to the following in your application:      * Click on an element on a chart and open a pane with more details on the clicked element.  * Create a filter for another chart. \nPREREQUISITES \nBefore you begin, install version 2.1.0 or later of the Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK. \nCLICK EVENT SYNTAX \nThe event handler takes an event type, click, and a callback function that contains information about the click event and the clicked element as a single payload object. The click event handler syntax looks similar to the following: chart.addEventListener(\"click\", callback); The event handler also allows you to define the mark roles for which you want to receive event information, thus eliminating the need to check the payload. The click event handler syntax for defining the mark roles to filter by looks similar to the following: const options = { includes: [{ roles: ['mark', 'axis-label'] }] };chart.addEventListener(\"click\", callback, options); The click event handler must be added after the chart has finished rendering, as shown in the following example: \nEXAMPLE chart.render(document.getElementById(\"chart\")).then(     () => chart.addEventListener('click',       (payload) => alert(JSON.stringify(payload)),       options)   );  \nNOTE If you specify the options parameter, the click event handler captures events only if the clicked mark's role matches one of the values specified in the parameter. If you omit this parameter, the click event handler captures all click events on the chart. \nPAYLOAD \nYou can use the click event payload to construct a custom filter that you can apply on other charts in your application.

For each encoded data field (x, y, series, intensity, color, shape, size, label, arc, value, target, number, display, text, location), the data element contains:  * The channel label  * The value of the clicked element  * The lower bound for numeric or date binning only For data tables, the Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK click event handler captures click events for fields that represent the channel data for the clicked element:  * groups field, which contains all Groups channels including label and value  * cell field, which contains the column header label and value of the clicked cell For geospatial charts, the Charts Embedding JavaScript SDK click event handler captures click events for the following elements:  * For choropleth charts, the click event handler captures the fields that represent the channel data for the clicked element:\n   \n   * lat field, which contains latitude\n   \n   * lng field, which contains longitude\n   \n   * location field, which contains the field label and value of the clicked geospatial area  * For geospatial scatter charts, the click event handler captures the fields that represent the channel data for the clicked element:\n   \n   * geopoint field, which contains the field name, value in GeoJSON format, and the coordinates of the clicked point \nSELECTIONFILTER ELEMENT \nThe selectionFilter element of the payload must contain a valid MQL filter document, which represents the filter that corresponds to the clicked mark's category channels or x value channel on a continuous chart. You can modify or implement your own selectionFilter. The filter object represents a single clicked item:  * A string or unbinned number or date, which becomes an equality match query ({field: value}) or a query using $eq, $ne, $in, or $nin operators.  * A binned number or date, which becomes a query using gt, $gte, $lt, or lte operators. Periodic dates are ignored. \nEXAMPLE { field: 'value' }{ field1: 'value1', field2: 'value2' }{ field: { $in: [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] } }{ field: { $nin: [ 'x', 'y', 'z' ] } }{ field: { $gt: 10 } }{ field: { $gt: 13, $lte: 30 } }{ field: { $gt: Date(\"2020-01-01\"), $lt: Date(\"2020-03-31\") } } The selectionFilter document can have several key and value filters. For example, if a mark of a multi-series chart is clicked, the filter document contains both the category and series filter pairs. Each filter must reference the actual data source fields used and not their labels. You can enable highlighting for clicked events using the setHighlight method. \nEXAMPLE const eventHandler = (payload) => {  chart.setHighlight(payload.selectionFilter);};\nchart.render(container).then(() => {  chart.addEventListener('click', eventHandler);}); To learn more, see Highlight Chart Elements. On an embedded chart that includes event handlers with a filter for element roles, the chart shows:  * The when you hover over an element that triggers a filtered click event  * The when you hover over an element that doesn't trigger a click event If the event handler doesn't include filter for element roles, the appears when you hover over any chart element. \nTARGET ELEMENT \nThe target element of the payload contains information about the clicked target including:  * The type of mark, such as rect, line, arc, symbol, group, or area  * The role of mark, such as mark, legend,

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nBACKING AGGREGATION PIPELINE \nTo get the data needed to render a chart, Charts creates a MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline which is executed on the MongoDB database server. The pipeline consists of multiple stages, each of which is generated based on different settings specified by the chart's author. This document explains how the various Chart Builder settings are used to construct the Aggregation Pipeline. You can view the pipeline used to create a chart by choosing the View Aggregation Pipeline option in the Chart Builder's ellipsis dropdown on the top right. The pipeline constructed by MongoDB Charts consists of the following segments in the following order:        1.  Charts views  2.  Dashboard filters  3.  Chart query  4.  Embedding filters  5.  Lookup fields  6.  Calculated fields  7.  Chart filters  8.  Encoded fields  9.  Sorting  10. Maximum document limit \nNOTE You do not need to configure all of the above settings when creating a chart. Unspecified settings are skipped when generating the aggregation pipeline. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following chart shows the total sale amounts from an office supply company, categorized by purchase method. Each document in the data collection represents a single sale. Using this chart as an example, we will explore how the specifications for each of the above settings change the aggregation pipeline generated by MongoDB Charts.  \nENCODING \nWithout any Data Source pipeline, Query bar queries, calculated fields, and filters added in the Filter pane, MongoDB Charts generates the following aggregation pipeline: 1{2  \"$addFields\": {              // Encoding3    \"__alias_0\": {4      \"$sum\": \"$items.price\"5    }6  }7},8{9  \"$group\": {10    \"_id\": {11      \"__alias_1\": \"$purchaseMethod\"12    },13    \"__alias_0\": {14      \"$sum\": \"$__alias_0\"15    }16  }17},18{19  \"$project\": {20    \"_id\": 0,21    \"__alias_1\": \"$_id.__alias_1\",22    \"__alias_0\": 123  }24},25{26  \"$project\": {27    \"x\": \"$__alias_1\",28    \"y\": \"$__alias_0\",29    \"_id\": 030  }31},32\n33{34  \"$addFields\": {              // Sorting35    \"__agg_sum\": {36      \"$sum\": [37        \"$y\"38      ]39    }40  }41},42{43  \"$sort\": {44    \"__agg_sum\": -145  }46},47{48  \"$project\": {49    \"__agg_sum\": 050  }51},52{53  \"$limit\": 500054}  The pipeline at this point consists of groups from the Encode panel, stages for the default sort order, and the maximum document limit, which is set to 5000 by MongoDB Charts. \nADDING QUERIES \nThe query below restricts the documents shown to only those with a saleDate equal to or more recent than January 1, 2017 with at least 5 elements in the items array. items is an array where each element is an item purchased during a sale. Query: {  $and: [  {    saleDate: { $gte: new Date(\"2017-01-01\") }  },  {    'items.4': { $exists: true }  } ]}  Applying the above query in the Query bar generates the following chart and

Adding this new calculated field, in addition to the query above, produces the following chart and pipeline: Calculated Field Expression:  Aggregation Pipeline: 1{2  \"$match\": {3    \"$and\": [4      {5        \"saleDate\": {6          \"$gte\": {7            \"$date\": \"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z\"8          }9        }10      },11      {12        \"items.4\": {13          \"$exists\": true14        }15      }16    ]17  }18},19{20  \"$addFields\": {              // Calculated Field21    \"revenue\": {22      \"$reduce\": {23        \"input\": \"$items\",24        \"initialValue\": 0,25        \"in\": {26          \"$sum\": [27            \"$$value\",28            {29              \"$multiply\": [30                \"$$this.price\",31                \"$$this.quantity\"32              ]33            }34          ]35        }36      }37    }38  }39},40{41  \"$group\": {42    \"_id\": {43      \"__alias_0\": \"$purchaseMethod\"44    },45    \"__alias_1\": {46      \"$sum\": \"$revenue\"47    }48  }49},50{51  \"$project\": {52    \"_id\": 0,53    \"__alias_0\": \"$_id.__alias_0\",54    \"__alias_1\": 155  }56},57{58  \"$project\": {59    \"x\": \"$__alias_0\",60    \"y\": \"$__alias_1\",61    \"_id\": 062  }63},64{65  \"$addFields\": {66    \"__agg_sum\": {67      \"$sum\": [68        \"$y\"69      ]70    }71  }72},73{74  \"$sort\": {75    \"__agg_sum\": -176  }77},78{79  \"$project\": {80    \"__agg_sum\": 081  }82},83{84  \"$limit\": 500085}  The updated pipeline now includes the calculated field right below the query applied in the Query bar while the order of the rest of the components remains unchanged. \nADDING FILTERS \nThis chart can be further refined by adding a filter in the Filter pane to only select in-store sales made in the New York location.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nCONNECT OR DISCONNECT DATA SOURCES AND DEPLOYMENTS \nOn this page    \n * Connect a Deployment to Charts\n   \n * Connect a Data Source to Charts\n * Disconnect a Deployment from Charts\n * Disconnect a Data Source from MongoDB Charts On the Data Sources page, an Atlas Project Owner can:      * Connect a deployment or connect a data source to MongoDB Charts.  * Disconnect a deployment or disconnect a data source from MongoDB Charts. To learn more about data sources and deployments, see Data Sources. Charts connects to all deployments and data sources by default. \nCONNECT A DEPLOYMENT TO CHARTS \nYou can connect a deployment to Charts to access the data for the collections within the deployment in Charts. To connect a deployment to Charts: 1 \nIN THE LEFT NAVIGATION MENU, CLICK DATA SOURCES. \nThe Data Sources page displays. 2 \nIN THE DEPLOYMENT DROPDOWN, SELECT THE DEPLOYMENT THAT CONTAINS YOUR DATA SOURCE. \nDeployments in MongoDB Charts reference Atlas deployments that contain valid Charts data sources, including:  * All clusters and serverless instances in your Atlas project for which you have the Project Data Access Read Only role or higher.  * All federated database instances in your project, including Online Archives. After you select a deployment, the following information displays: Field\nDescription\nDeployment Name\nHuman-readable label that identifies the deployment in Atlas.\nDeployment Connection Status\nLabel that indicates whether you connected the deployment to MongoDB Charts.\nType\nLabel that identifies the deployment as a replica set, serverless instance, or federated database instance.\nStatus\nLabel that indicates the current operating condition of the deployment.\nVersion\nLabel that indicates the MongoDB version on which the deployment runs. Charts doesn't display Version for federated database instances.\nRegion\nLabel that indicates the cloud provider and region where MongoDB provisions the deployment. Charts doesn't display Region for serverless instances.\nTier\nLabel that indicates the Atlas cluster tier for the deployment. Charts doesn't display Tier for federated database instances and serverless instances. 3 \nCHECK THE CONNECTION STATUS AND CONNECT THE DEPLOYMENT. \nIf the deployment connection status is Connected, the deployment is already connected to Charts. The Data Access section displays all of the collections within the selected Atlas deployment. If the deployment connection status is Disconnected:  a. Click the connect icon next to the deployment connection status.  b. Click Reconnect on the modal that appears.

\nDISCONNECT A DEPLOYMENT FROM CHARTS \nDisconnect a deployment to disconnect all data sources within the deployment from Charts. If you disconnect a deployment, you can reconnect it later to resume rendering charts that use the deployment's data sources. To disconnect a deployment: 1 \nIN THE LEFT NAVIGATION MENU, CLICK DATA SOURCES. \nThe Data Sources page displays. 2 \nIN THE DEPLOYMENT DROPDOWN, SELECT THE DEPLOYMENT THAT CONTAINS YOUR DATA SOURCE. \nDeployments in MongoDB Charts reference Atlas deployments that contain valid Charts data sources, including:  * All clusters and serverless instances in your Atlas project for which you have the Project Data Access Read Only role or higher.  * All federated database instances in your project, including Online Archives. After you select a deployment, the following information displays: Field\nDescription\nDeployment Name\nHuman-readable label that identifies the deployment in Atlas.\nDeployment Connection Status\nLabel that indicates whether you connected the deployment to MongoDB Charts.\nType\nLabel that identifies the deployment as a replica set, serverless instance, or federated database instance.\nStatus\nLabel that indicates the current operating condition of the deployment.\nVersion\nLabel that indicates the MongoDB version on which the deployment runs. Charts doesn't display Version for federated database instances.\nRegion\nLabel that indicates the cloud provider and region where MongoDB provisions the deployment. Charts doesn't display Region for serverless instances.\nTier\nLabel that indicates the Atlas cluster tier for the deployment. Charts doesn't display Tier for federated database instances and serverless instances. 3 \nCHECK THE CONNECTION STATUS AND DISCONNECT THE DEPLOYMENT. \nIf the deployment connection status is Disconnected, the deployment is already disconnected from Charts. If the deployment connection status is Connected:  a. Click the disconnect icon next to the deployment connection status. The Disconnect Deployment modal appears.  b. Click Check for connected charts to learn whether any charts use the deployment's collections as a data source.  c. Click Disconnect. The deployment disconnects from Charts. \nDISCONNECT A DATA SOURCE FROM MONGODB CHARTS \nDisconnect a data source from Charts to remove its data from your charts. If you disconnect a data source:  * Any charts you built that use the data source no longer render and display an error.  * Any charts that use $lookup to access data in the data source no longer render and display an error.  * You can't use the data source to build new charts. You can also disconnect a deployment. If you disconnect a data source, you can reconnect it later to resume rendering charts that use its data. \nNOTE Charts automatically includes the Sample Data: Movies data source in all Charts tenants. The Sample Dashboard uses this data source to show the charts you can create. You can access the sample data source from all dashboards. You can't:  * Add, edit, or delete the data in the Sample Data: Movies data source.  * Remove the sample data source.  * Externally share or embed charts that use the sample data. To disconnect a data source from Charts: 1 \nIN THE LEFT NAVIGATION MENU, CLICK DATA SOURCES. \nThe Data Sources page displays. 2 \nIN THE DEPLOYMENT DROPDOWN, SELECT THE DEPLOYMENT THAT CONTAINS YOUR DATA SOURCE. \nDeployments in MongoDB Charts reference Atlas deployments that contain valid Charts data sources, including:  * All clusters and serverless instances in your Atlas project for which you have the Project Data Access Read Only role or higher.  * All federated database instances in your project, including Online Archives. After you select a deployment, the following information displays: Field\nDescription\nDeployment Name\nHuman-readable label that identifies the deployment in Atlas.\nDeployment Connection Status\nLabel that indicates whether you connected the deployment to MongoDB Charts.\nType\nLabel that identifies the deployment as a replica set, serverless instance, or federated database instance.\nStatus\nLabel that indicates the current operating condition of the deployment.\nVersion\nLabel that indicates the MongoDB version on which the deployment runs. Charts doesn't display Version for federated database instances.\nRegion\nLabel that indicates the cloud provider and region where MongoDB provisions the deployment. Charts doesn't display Region for serverless instances.\nTier\nLabel that indicates the Atlas cluster tier for the deployment. Charts doesn't display Tier for federated database instances and serverless instances. 3 \nIN THE DATA ACCESS SECTION, SELECT THE DATABASE THAT CONTAINS THE DATA SOURCE. \nSelect the database that contains the data source you want to disconnect.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nFILTER EMBEDDED DASHBOARDS \nOn this page    \n * Specify Filterable Fields\n   \n * Filters for Embedded Documents\n * Filter Data on Dashboards Embedded in an iframe\n * Filter Syntax\n * Filter Data on Dashboards Embedded with the SDK\n * Inject User-Specific Filters You can customize your embedded dashboards by appending various query parameters to their iframe URLs or using the filter option with the Charts Embedding SDK. \nSPECIFY FILTERABLE FIELDS \nA dashboard Author specifies the fields that can be included in filters set by the embedding application code or added by dashboard viewers. A dashboard author can limit access to data by allowing only certain fields to be filtered. By default, no fields are allowed, meaning the dashboard cannot be filtered until you explicitly allow at least one field. To define filterable fields:       1. For the desired dashboard, click the button and select Embed from the dropdown.  2. In the Allowed filter fields section, click the button.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    This option only appears if you already have Unauthenticated or Authenticated embedding access enabled.\n    \n    You can specify on which fields dashboard viewers can filter data by:\n    \n    * Using the dropdown to select the fields\n    \n    * Manually typing values to add fields not listed in the dropdown\n    \n    * Selecting Allow all fields in the data source used in this dashboard  3. When you have selected all desired fields, click Save below the dropdown. Dashboard viewers and applications which render the dashboard can now use filters based on the specified fields to display subsets of the original dashboard data. If a viewer attempts to use a filter for a field not included in the Allowed filter fields list, MongoDB Charts returns an error. \nFILTERS FOR EMBEDDED DOCUMENTS \nWhen you add a field to the Allowed filter fields list whose value is an embedded document, you must also specify each individual sub-field you want to allow. \nEXAMPLE Consider the following document: {  \"name\": \"Alice\",  \"favorites\" :  {    \"color\": \"green\",    \"animal\": \"turtle\",    \"season\": \"autumn\"  }}  If you only add the favorites field to the list of allowed fields, it does not grant viewers permission to filter upon any of the sub-fields of favorites. Instead, you may add one or more of the sub-fields to the list individually by specifying favorites.color, favorites.animal, or favorites.season. \nFILTER DATA ON DASHBOARDS EMBEDDED IN AN IFRAME \nUse the filter query parameter to only display data that matches a specified MQL filter in your dashboard embedded in an iframe. You can only use the filter query parameter on the Unauthenticated dashboard. With unauthenticated dashboards, the dashboard Author specifies the fields that can be included in filters set by the embedding application code or added by dashboard viewers. To learn how to specify filterable fields, see Specify Filterable Fields. \nFILTER SYNTAX \nYou can specify an MQL document as your filter query parameter provided that the fields used in your filter are in the list of allowed filterable fields. Your filter must match the format used in a $match query and be either a:  * Top level query\n   \n   \n   EXAMPLE\n   \n   { \"quantity\": { $gte: 20 } }\n   \n     * Or within boolean expressions ( $and, $nor, $or)\n   \n   \n   EXAMPLE\n   \n   { $or: [ { quantity: { $lt: 20 } }, { price: 10 } ] }\n   \n    \nNOTE You must URL-encode special characters of the filter parameter.

Charts users have access to the dashboard and the actions they can perform on the dashboard. The following dashboard permissions are available: Permission\nDescription\nViewer Can perform the following actions:      * Open a dashboard and view charts that are backed by a data source the user has permission to view. If the user doesn't have the appropriate project role on a chart's backing data source, the dashboard doesn't render the chart.\n   \n   Viewers cannot make any modifications to the dashboard.  * Open a dashboard and view charts that have been shared with the user's Atlas organization. To learn more about sharing dashboards with an entire organization, see Access for All Users in an Organization.  * Filter dashboards based on available fields.  * Configure refresh settings and manually refresh dashboard data.\n   \n   \n   NOTE\n   \n   Refresh settings are stored in the local browser state. These settings are not persisted with the dashboard or shared between users. Author Has all privileges of Viewer and can also:  * Add, modify, and delete charts,  * Add, edit, and delete dashboard filters,  * Specify which fields can be used for Unauthenticated embedded chart filters,  * Change dashboard layout,  * Rename the dashboard. Owner Has all privileges of Author and can also:  * Manage permissions on the dashboard  * Delete the dashboard. The creator of the dashboard automatically has the Owner permission. The creator cannot be removed from the list of dashboard users and their Owner permission cannot be modified. To view a chart on a dashboard, the user must have both:  * A project role that grants access to the data source. To learn more about granting access, see Modify Role Permissions for Data Sources.  * Any role on the dashboard, or access to an Atlas organization's dashboard through organization-wide sharing. \nNOTE \nDEFAULT DASHBOARD PERMISSIONS You can have no permissions on a dashboard. That dashboard won't appear on your dashboards page. Newly-created dashboards aren't shared by default. Only the dashboard Owner can view the dashboard until they grant access to more users. \nVIEW DASHBOARD PERMISSIONS \nTo view permissions for a specific dashboard, hover over the icon next to the dashboard's Share button.

Syntax\n * Filter Data on Charts Embedded with the SDK\n * Inject User-Specific Filters You can customize your embedded charts by appending various query parameters to their iframe URLs or using the filter option with the Charts Embedding SDK. \nNOTE To embed charts from your dashboards, you must configure embedding options on your data sources. For instructions, see:      * Embed Charts in Your Web Application You can filter embedded charts and charts on embedded dashboards. \nSPECIFY FILTERABLE FIELDS \nA chart Author specifies the fields that can be included in filters set by the embedding application code or added by chart viewers. A chart author can limit access to data by allowing only certain fields to be filtered. By default, no fields are allowed, meaning the chart cannot be filtered until you explicitly allow at least one field. To define filterable fields:  1. Navigate to the dashboard that contains the chart where you wish to define filterable fields.  2. For the desired chart, click the button and select Embed Chart from the dropdown.  3. In the Allowed filter fields section, use the dropdown to select which fields chart viewers can use filter data in the chart. You can also manually type values to add fields not listed in the dropdown.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    This option only appears if you already have Unauthenticated or Authenticated embedding access enabled.\n    \n    You can specify on which fields chart viewers can filter data by:\n    \n    * Using the dropdown to select the fields\n    \n    * Manually typing values to add fields not listed in the dropdown\n    \n    * Selecting Allow all fields in the data source used in this chart  4. When you have selected all desired fields, click Save below the dropdown. Chart viewers and applications which render the chart can now use filters based on the specified fields to display subsets of the original chart data. If a viewer attempts to use a filter for a field not included in the Allowed filter fields list, MongoDB Charts returns an error. \nFILTERS FOR EMBEDDED DOCUMENTS \nWhen you add a field to the Allowed filter fields list whose value is an embedded document, you must also specify each individual sub-field you want to allow. \nEXAMPLE Consider the following document: {  \"name\": \"Alice\",  \"favorites\" :  {    \"color\": \"green\",    \"animal\": \"turtle\",    \"season\": \"autumn\"  }}  If you only add the favorites field to the list of allowed fields, it does not grant viewers permission to filter upon any of the sub-fields of favorites. Instead, you may add one or more of the sub-fields to the list individually by specifying favorites.color, favorites.animal, or favorites.season. \nFILTER DATA ON CHARTS EMBEDDED IN AN IFRAME \nUse the filter query parameter to only display data that matches a specified MQL filter in your chart embedded in an iframe. You can use the filter query parameter on both Unauthenticated and Verified Signature charts. The filtering behavior differs with each authentication setting:  * With unauthenticated charts, the chart Author specifies the fields that can be included in filters set by the embedding application code or added by chart viewers. To learn how to specify filterable fields, see Specify Filterable Fields.  * With charts which require a Verified Signature, all document fields can be filtered upon, however you must generate the filter in the server-side code and include the filter as part of your signed payload. \nFILTER SYNTAX \nSelect the appropriate tab to see an example of how to filter data in an Unauthenticated chart and a Verified Signature chart:   FILTER DATA ON CHARTS EMBEDDED WITH THE SDK \nYou can add a filter to an embedded chart with the filter option. Filtering allows the chart author to only display data in the embedded chart which matches a specified MQL filter. In the Embed Chart modal, you must specify any fields included in the filter.

The token lifetime is the difference between the issued at time claim and the expiration time claim.\n   \n   \n   EXAMPLE\n   \n   Charts rejects a token containing the following claims because the token lifetime of one year is too long:\n   \n   {  \"iat\": \"1587497399\",  \"exp\": \"1617305399\"}\n   \n   Charts can accept a token containing the following claims because the token lifetime of one hour is acceptable:\n   \n   {  \"iat\": \"1585769399\",  \"exp\": \"1585772999\"}  * Are signed using either the HS256 or RS256 signing algorithm.  * Are signed with a key that can be verified by the secret you provide when you configure the custom JWT authentication provider.  * Contain an audience claim that matches the one you specified when you configure the provider, if applicable. \nPROCEDURES  VIEW AUTHENTICATION PROVIDERS \nTo view the embedding authentication providers you have configured: 1 GO TO THE AUTHENTICATION SETTINGS VIEW. \n a. If Charts is not already displayed, click Charts in the navigation bar.  b. Click Embedding in the sidebar.  c. Click the Authentication Settings tab. 2 VIEW THE CONFIGURED AUTHENTICATION PROVIDERS IN THE AUTHENTICATION PROVIDERS SECTION.  ADD AN AUTHENTICATION PROVIDER \nTo add an embedding authentication provider: 1 GO TO THE AUTHENTICATION SETTINGS VIEW. \n a. If Charts is not already displayed, click Charts in the navigation bar.  b. Click Embedding in the sidebar.  c. Click the Authentication Settings tab. 2 FROM THE AUTHENTICATION PROVIDERS SECTION, CLICK ADD. \n3 IN THE NAME FIELD, ENTER A DESCRIPTIVE NAME FOR THE PROVIDER. \n4 FROM THE PROVIDER LIST, SELECT THE TYPE OF PROVIDER YOU WANT TO ADD. \n5 CONFIGURE CHARTS TO VERIFY TOKENS FROM THE PROVIDER. \nThe values you must enter differ based on the provider you selected: Provider\nFields\nCustom JWT Provide the following values: Field\nValue\nSigning Algorithm Encryption algorithm with which the JWT signature is encoded. Must be one of:  * HS256  * RS256 Signing Key Secret or key used to validate the JWT signature. If tokens are not signed, Charts considers them invalid.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nAREA CHART SHOWING AGE DISTRIBUTION OF CUSTOMERS \nTime to Complete: 5 minutes In the final chart of the dashboard, highlight some of the customer analytic information available in the schema using an area chart. By visualizing the age range and distribution of store customers, you can ensure that any advertising the store performs is directed where it will be seen by the most potential buyers. \nCONSTRUCT THE CHART \n1 \nAT THE TOP-RIGHT CORNER OF THE DASHBOARD, CLICK ADD CHART. \n2 \nSELECT THE SAMPLE_SUPPLIES.SALES DATA SOURCE. \nIn the Select Data Source modal that appears:       a. Click the Project tab.  b. Click the name of the deployment that contains the sample data source.  c. Click the sample_supplies database. The database's data sources appear.  b. Click Select on the sales data source. 3 \nSELECT THE CHART TYPE \n a. In the Chart Type dropdown, select Area.  b. Click Discrete below the dropdown. \nEXAMPLE \nAREA CHART An area chart is a good choice to easily visualize the ages where customers are the most concentrated. Since you are not concerned with exact values in this scenario but rather general trends, an area chart makes more sense than a line chart because the filled-in visualization allows us to more easily identify the most common age ranges. We use a discrete area chart, rather than continuous, because we are ultimately looking for a count of the customers in each particular age bracket determined by the chart's bin size. Discrete charts allow us to perform aggregation operations on the data, whereas in a continuous chart each data point must come from a distinct document. 4 \nADD THE DESIRED FIELDS TO THE PROPER ENCODING CHANNELS. \n a. In the Fields section click the customer field to expand the customer object and view its properties.  b. Drag the customer.age field to the X Axis encoding channel. The X Axis encoding channel dictates which field to display on the horizontal axis.  c. Set the Bin Size to 5.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    \n    DATA BINNING\n    \n    Binning data groups continuous data into bins of a specified size. In this case, rather than plotting points for each individual age in the dataset, the data is grouped into bins of 5 ages. This provides a clearer look into the overall trend of the age distribution.\n    \n    For more information on data binning, see the Data Binning section.  d. Drag the _id field to the Y Axis encoding channel. The Y Axis encoding channel determines which field to use for the chart's aggregation.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    \n    Y AXIS ENCODING CHANNEL\n    \n    Because we will be performing a $count aggregation on the documents, it does not matter what field we use for this encoding channel because the chosen field does not affect the number of documents in each bin.  e. In the Y Axis Aggregate dropdown, select count. This option counts the occurrence of each customer age from each sale and adds it to the visualization after placing it in the appropriate bin. Your chart should now look something like this:  Customers appear to be mostly between the ages 40-45. This is where the largest area region in the chart occurs. Additionally, the rest of the ages appear to be normally distributed, meaning the average customer age is at the center of the area chart and there are the same number of younger and older customers. You can use this information to direct advertising where the largest customer age group is most likely to see company advertisements. 5 \nTITLE YOUR CHART. \n a. Hover over your chart title and click the pencil icon.  b. Copy the following into the title input:\n    \n    Distribution of Customer Ages\n    \n      c. Click the check mark to save your title. 6 \nCLICK SAVE AND CLOSE AT THE TOP-LEFT OF THE CHART BUILDER VIEW. \nAfter adding the last chart to your dashboard and performing some final reorganizing, the

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nCOLUMN CHART SHOWING TOTAL SALES BY STORE LOCATION \nTime to Complete: 5 minutes Looking at the data fields available in the schema, some of the most valuable information you can relay revolves around revenue. You may want to know how various stores are performing, specifically if there are any stores significantly under or overperforming compared to others. A column chart works well for this type of visualization because you can easily compare individual store revenue based on the size of each column. \nCONSTRUCT THE CHART \n1 \nCLICK ADD CHART. \n2 \nSELECT THE SAMPLE_SUPPLIES.SALES DATA SOURCE. \nIn the Select Data Source modal that appears:       a. Click the Project tab.  b. Click the name of the deployment that contains the sample data source.  c. Click the sample_supplies database. The database's data sources appear.  b. Click Select on the sales data source. 3 \nSELECT THE CHART TYPE \n a. In the Chart Type dropdown, select Column.  b. Click Stacked below the dropdown. \nEXAMPLE \nCOLUMN CHART This chart renders a column for each store location's revenue. Because there are six different store locations, the chart will contain six columns. 4 \nADD THE DESIRED FIELDS TO THE PROPER ENCODING CHANNELS. \n a. Drag the storeLocation property from the Fields section of the Chart Builder view to the X Axis encoding channel. This tells MongoDB Charts to create a column for each storeLocation value in the dataset.  b. In the Fields section click the items field to expand the items object and view its properties.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    MongoDB Charts infers the data type of each field and provides symbols to easily determine these data types when building your chart. For example, the calendar icon next to the saleDate field signifies that this field is a timestamp. These symbols can help ensure your chart renders as expected by using proper data types for each encoding channel.  c. Drag the items.price field to the Y Axis encoding channel. The Y Axis encoding channel determines which field to use for the chart's aggregation.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    \n    AGGREGATION\n    \n    Aggregation processes data records using a wide variety of methods and returns computed results which may not be available in the original dataset. Because we are interested in the total revenue from each store, we use the items.price field here and will use an aggregation operator which will allow us to add the items.price fields together.  d. In the Array Reductions dropdown, select Unwind array.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    \n    UNWIND ARRAY\n    \n    Array reductions dictate how to process an array so its elements can be visualized. The unwind array option creates a new document for each element in the array, so each item's price is added to the total for that store.\n    \n    For more information on unwinding arrays, refer to the unwind aggregation documentation.  e. In the Aggregate dropdown, select sum.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    \n    SUM\n    \n    This option adds the prices of all items per store together to display the chart. For more information on the $sum aggregation command, refer to the sum aggregation documentation. Your chart should now look something like this:  Notice that the stores generating the most revenue are the Denver and Seattle locations. 5 \nTITLE YOUR CHART. \n a. Hover over your chart title above the center of the chart and click the pencil icon.  b. Copy the following into the chart title input:\n    \n    Total Sales ($) by Store Location\n    \n      c. Click the check mark to save your title. 6 \nCLICK SAVE AND CLOSE AT THE TOP RIGHT OF THE CHART BUILDER VIEW. \nYou will be navigated back to your Super Store Supply Sales dashboard and it should look

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nDONUT CHART SHOWING MOST COMMON TAGS FOR ITEMS SOLD \nTime to Complete: 5 minutes Next we will add a chart where you can quickly see which types of items the company is selling the most of. This information will be helpful for the company marketing team to know how effectively direct advertising. In this scenario, your manager has expressed interest specifically in items sold from the Denver and New York store locations. Additionally, they have requested to only visualize sales which contain an item costing $1200 or more, in an effort to more closely examine the new line of laptops being sold at these locations and what types of items are being bought with them. You can accomplish this using a filter in your donut chart, as shown in the following procedure. \nCONSTRUCT THE CHART \n1 \nAT THE TOP-RIGHT CORNER OF THE DASHBOARD, CLICK ADD CHART. \n2 \nSELECT THE SAMPLE_SUPPLIES.SALES DATA SOURCE. \nIn the Select Data Source modal that appears:       a. Click the Project tab.  b. Click the name of the deployment that contains the sample data source.  c. Click the sample_supplies database. The database's data sources appear.  b. Click Select on the sales data source. 3 \nSELECT THE CHART TYPE \n a. In the Chart Type dropdown, select Circular.  b. Click Donut below the dropdown. \nEXAMPLE \nDONUT CHART A donut chart is a good choice for this chart because donut charts show the relationship of parts to a whole. Using this chart type you can easily get an idea of which tags make up the greatest portion of total sales. 4 \nADD THE DESIRED FIELDS TO THE PROPER ENCODING CHANNELS. \n a. In the Fields section click the items field to expand the items object and view its properties.  b. Drag the items.tags field to the Label encoding channel. The Label encoding channel dictates which field to use when dividing the sections of the chart.  c. In the array reduction dropdown for the items array select Unwind array.  d. In the array reduction dropdowns for the tags select Array element by index. Using this option you can specify which element of the tags array to visualize.  e. Enter 0 for the Index input to only visualize the first element of the tags array. The first item tag is the most relevant tag to the item, so it should be the main concern in the visualiztion. This is the primary item tag.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    Selecting an array element by index also ensures the chart does not get overcrowded with less important tags as it would had you chosen to unwind the tags array rather than select a specific element.  f. Drag the id field to the Arc encoding channel.  g. In the Aggregate dropdown, select count. This option counts the occurrences of the first tag of each item and adds them to the chart. Your chart should now look something like this: \n5 \nCOPY THE FOLLOWING FILTER INTO THE QUERY INPUT ABOVE THE MAIN CHART DISPLAY. \n{ storeLocation: { $in: [ \"Denver\", \"New York\" ] }, 'items.price': {$gte: 1200} }  This filter specifies that Charts only visualizes item tags from items sold from either the Denver or New York store location where there was an item in the sale costing $1200 or more. 6 \nCLICK APPLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE FILTER. \nYour chart should now look something like this:  Notice how the electronics tag now takes a larger slice of the distribution compared to when not using the filter. Based on this chart, notice that office and school are the two most common primary item tags from sales matching the filter. 7 \nTITLE YOUR CHART. \n a. Hover over your chart title and click the pencil icon.  b. Copy the following into the chart title input:\n    \n    Frequency of Item Tags from Sales in Denver and New York with Price Threshold\n    \n      c. Click the check mark to save your title. 8 \nCLICK SAVE AND CLOSE AT THE TOP-LEFT OF THE CHART BUILDER VIEW. \nYour dashboard should now look something like this:  \nNEXT STEPS \nNow that we have a chart showing the tags of the items sold, it would be helpful to know which specific items are most commonly sold at the various store locations.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nAXES \nOn this page    \n * Max and Min\n   \n * Logarithmic Scale\n * Label Override\n * Secondary Y Axis MongoDB Charts offers several customization options which modify the representation of a chart's X and Y value axes without affecting the formatting of the data points in the visualization. \nNOTE This page illustrates the value axis customization options which are available for most chart types. Some chart types have other customization options which are noted on their individual documentation pages. To access value axis customization options, expand the Axes section of the Customize tab.  \nNOTE A value axis shows a continuous scale of values. Charts such as Bar/Column and Discrete Line/Area have just one value axis. Continuous line and area and scatter charts have two value axes. \nMAX AND MIN \nThe Max and Min value axis options allow you to specify maximum and minimum values to display on a chart. Any data points with values outside the specified limits appear at the boundaries of the chart. Setting a maximum display value is useful for removing outlying data from the chart and allowing the viewer to focus on more relevant information. \nNOTE Changing the minimum for bar and column charts from the default of zero is not recommended. Doing so means the length of the bars is no longer proportional to the data point values. The following chart types can use max and min:      * all Bar/Column except 100% stacked  * Discrete and Continuous Line  * Discrete and Continuous Area  * Scatter \nLOGARITHMIC SCALE \nToggling the Logarithmic Scale switch to the On position causes your chart to use a logarithmic scale instead of a linear scale for data values. Using a logarithmic scale is helpful for showing the percentage change from one value to the next and for charts with a large value differential from smallest to largest. Data sets such as stock market movements, earthquake strength measurements, and global population sizes are good use cases for a logarithmic scale chart. \nLOGARITHMIC SCALE CONSIDERATIONS \n * Use the Logarithmic Scale option only with chart data that consists of either all positive values or all negative values. If the chart includes a mix of positive and negative values, or if it includes the value 0, the chart will not render.  * Bar and column charts normally have a baseline of 0, but logarithmic scale charts have a baseline of 1 because log(0) is undefined. As a result, charts with data points between 0 and 1 do not render well. You can mitigate this effect by setting the axis minimum of the chart to a value greater than zero but smaller than the lowest value in the data set. The following chart types can use logarithmic scale:  * Grouped and Colored Bar/Column  * Discrete and Continuous Line  * Scatter \nLABEL OVERRIDE \nThe Label Override field allows you to create a custom axis label. Custom labels can be more descriptive than the default labels and help chart viewers quickly grasp the significance of chart data. The Label Override customization option is available on the X or Y value axis for charts in which the author has encoded multiple data series by mapping more than one field on a given axis. To customize the axis label for charts that have a single field mapped, use the Label Override option within that field's customization options. The following chart types can use label override:  * Bar/Column  * Line  * Area  * Scatter \nSECONDARY Y AXIS \nIf you map multiple Aggregation or Value fields to the Y axis, you can plot one set of values on a secondary Y axis. This customization option is useful for comparing two data series with significantly different scales using the same chart.  \nUSAGE \nYou can plot a secondary Y axis on the following chart types:  * Grouped column  * Discrete line  * Continuous line  * Continuous area To plot a field on a secondary Y axis:  1. Click the Customize tab above the encoding channels in the Chart Builder.  2. Expand the Fields section of the Customize tab.  3. Select the field you want to plot on a secondary Y axis from the dropdown menu.  4. Set the Plot on Secondary Axis toggle switch to On. After the secondary Y axis is enabled, you can customize its value axis options.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nSCATTER CHART \nOn this page    \n * Scatter Chart Encoding Channels\n   \n * Use Cases\n * Customization Options\n * Examples\n * Limitations Scatter charts plot data with individual data points placed along the X and Y axes. Optionally, the data point representations may use shapes and colors to display additional data dimensions. \nSCATTER CHART ENCODING CHANNELS \nScatter charts provide the following encoding channels: Encoding Channel\nDescription\nX / Y Axis\nThe X and Y axis encoding channels accept numerical and date fields and display the range of values from the field along the corresponding axis.\nSize (Optional) An aggregation encoding channel that changes the size of the data point markers, with larger sizes indicating larger aggregated values. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: Customize Mark Size Color\n(Optional) A category encoding channel that changes the color of the data point markers based on the value of the selected field. MongoDB Charts lists the colors used in a key to the right of the chart.\nShape\n(Optional) A category encoding channel that changes the shape of the data point markers based on the value of the selected field. MongoDB Charts lists the shapes used in a key to the right of the chart.\nTooltip Detail (Optional) A category encoding channel that adds the value of the selected field to each data point's tooltip. To view a data point tooltip, hover over that point in the chart. In addition to the Tooltip Detail field, the tooltip also shows other fields used to construct the chart. \nUSE CASES \nScatter charts are useful for representing numerical data and showing clearly how data points cluster together in certain areas. The Size, Color, and Shape encoding channels allow you to reveal additional trends for data dimensions with low cardinality. \nTIP A chart with many different colors or shapes may result in a cluttered visualization which is difficult to read. You can limit the number of categories in your chart by binning or limiting your data. Scatter charts show an individual marker for each data point, so they work better with smaller result sets. Outliers and extreme data points are easy to identify. Consider using a scatter chart to display:      * Temperature data for selected cities  * Volume of sales data for selected retail outlets  * Population density figures across several countries \nCUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS \nThe following customization options are specific to scatter charts. To see all available customization options, see Customize Charts. \nOPACITY \nThe Opacity customization option, measured as a percentage, modifies the transparency of the data point fill. This setting defaults to 0%, which renders the data point fill as completely transparent. \nSTROKE THICKNESS \nThe Stroke Thickness customization option, measured in pixels, modifies the thickness of data point outlines. This setting defaults to 2. \nMARK SIZE \nAdjust the size of the scatter marks. This option behaves differently based on whether you have a field mapped to the Size encoding channel.  * If you do not have a field mapped to Size, the Mark Size setting changes the size of the marks linearly based on the chosen value.  * If you have a field mapped to Size, the Mark Size setting changes the size of the largest mark, and also controls the difference between the smallest and largest marks. \nSMART DATE LABELS \nSmart labels for dates are axis markers grouped by units of time to reduce repetition of information. They are generated automatically based on the range of the chart when a date type field is encoded on an X or Y value axis. Smart labels are enabled by default when dates fields are encoded on value axes on supported chart types. To toggle smart labels on and off:  1. Click the Customize tab above the encoding channels in the Chart Builder.  2. Expand the Fields section.  3. Select the desired field from the dropdown menu.  4. If the Use Smart Labels on Axis toggle swich is set to Off, toggle it to On.  \nNOTE When smart labels are enabled, date and time formatting options remain available. Any formatting options you apply are visible in the chart's tooltips. \nADD A TRENDLINE \nYou can add a trendline to a continuous line/area or scatter chart. To enable the trendline feature:  1. Open the Customize pane for your chart.  2. Scroll down to the Chart Elements section.  3. Toggle the Trendline switch.  4. Select a series from the Series dropdown menu.  5. Select a trendline type from the Type dropdown menu. Trendlines span the entire length of a chart's X axis, including any additional space added as a result of a min/max axis customization.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nCOLUMN AND BAR CHARTS \nOn this page    \n * Column and Bar Chart Encoding Channels\n   \n * Column and Bar Chart Types\n * Use Cases\n * Customization Options\n * Examples\n * Limitations Column and bar charts plot data in either horizontal or vertical segments where the length of the segment is proportional to the data value. Column and bar charts provide high-level overviews of data trends by comparing values within a specific category. \nCOLUMN AND BAR CHART ENCODING CHANNELS \nColumn and bar charts provide the following encoding channels: Encoding Channel\nDescription\nX / Y Axis\n     * In the category axis encoding channel, a bar or column is rendered for each unique value from this field.\n   \n   In a column chart, the category is the X Axis, which results in vertical segments. In a bar chart, the category is the Y Axis, which results in horizontal segments.  * The aggregation axis encoding channel dictates which field to aggregate on and the type of aggregation to perform. This ultimately dictates the size of each bar or column.\n   \n   \n   NOTE\n   \n   You can aggregate upon multiple fields in your dataset to create multi-series charts. For more information, see Multiple Field Mappings. Series (Optional) A category encoding channel that segments the axis category based on the unique values in this field. If omitted, MongoDB Charts renders a basic bar or column chart with just a comparison of the X Axis and Y Axis fields. \nNOTE This option is only available for Grouped and Stacked charts with a single field mapped in the aggregation channel. Color\n(Optional) An aggregation encoding channel for Colored charts that changes the bars or columns' colors to reflect the aggregated value of the field, with darker colors meaning greater values. \nCOLUMN AND BAR CHART TYPES \nColumn and bar charts provide the following sub-types: Sub-Type Name\nDescription\nGrouped MongoDB Charts groups data by the category specified in the category encoding channel, and plots a bar or column for each value in the Series encoding channel. For a more detailed example, refer to the grouped column chart example. Stacked MongoDB Charts creates a bar or column for each distinct value in the category encoding channel field, and splits each bar or column into segments based on the the Series encoding channel. For a more detailed example, refer to the stacked bar chart example. 100% Stacked 100% stacked charts behave similarly to traditional stacked charts, with the difference that in a 100% stacked chart each bar or column is normalized to a consistent value of 100%. Just as with traditional stacked charts, each bar or column is split into segments based on the Series encoding channel. Each series is shown as a percentage of the whole. When using a traditional stacked chart, it can be difficult to compare the proportions of each series to the whole if the total values of the bars / columns greatly differ. This type of chart makes it easier to compare proportions within each bar or column by showing relative percentages. \nNOTE You cannot customize the minimum, maximum, or logarithmic scale value axis options of 100% stacked charts. For a more detailed example, refer to the 100% stacked bar chart example. Colored MongoDB Charts creates a bar or column for each distinct value in the category encoding channel field, and the Color encoding channel changes the color of each bar / column based on the aggregated value of the value specified in the encoding channel. For a more detailed example, refer to the colored bar chart example. \nUSE CASES \nColumn and bar charts display information in similar manners and, as such, have similar use cases. There are, however, situations where it may be beneficial to use one over the other:  * A bar chart may be a better choice than a column chart when the category labels are long, as it may be difficult to quickly pinpoint which label applies to which column.  * A column chart may be a better choice when comparing sequential values (such as time or geographic data) because the viewer will intuitively read these charts from left to right and attain the full picture of the visualization. \nTIP Column and bar charts are best suited for data with limited categories. When plotting data with many categories, such as years across a long period of time, consider using a Line Chart. You can also limit the number of categories displayed in your chart to focus on a subset of your data.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nFIELDS \nOn this page    \n * Field Label Override\n   \n * Number Formats\n * Date Format and Time Zone Within the customization tab, you can modify how MongoDB Charts displays data fields in your visualization. The customization options available depend on the data type of the value you are customizing. \nNOTE This page illustrates the field-level customization options which are available for most chart types. Some chart types have other customization options which are noted on their individual documentation pages. To access field-level customization options, expand the General section of the Customize tab. Select the desired field from the dropdown menu.  \nFIELD LABEL OVERRIDE \nWhen you encode a field in the Chart Builder, MongoDB Charts automatically generates a label for the field in the visualization. Charts generates the label based on the field name and the type of aggregation applied to the field if appropriate. You can use this customization option to override the default label to provide more insightful or descriptive field labels. To override a field label:       1. Navigate to the Customize tab in the Chart Builder.  2. Expand the Fields section.  3. Select the field whose label you wish to modify from the dropdown menu to expand its customization options.  4. Set the Label Override toggle switch to On.  5. Enter the new desired field label in the text box. This option affects all places in the chart the field label appears, including axis titles, legends, tooltips, etc. Your chart automatically updates to show the new label. This option is available on all chart types. \nNUMBER FORMATS \nYou can use these customization options to specify how Charts formats numbers in your data fields. These options are available on all chart types. \nNUMBER FORMAT OPTIONS \nMongoDB Charts provides the following options for formatting numbers. You can use any combination of these options to customize your chart: Option\nDescription\nThousands Separators\nShow or hide commas as thousands separators for data values. By default, Charts shows thousands separators.\nDecimals\nSpecifies to how many decimal places Charts rounds each data value or label. If you specify this option, Charts displays all values with the specified number of decimal places, either by rounding decimals or adding zeroes to whole numbers. If you do not specify this option, Charts displays values in their original form with no modifications.\nMultiplier\nSpecifies a number by which Charts multiplies each data value or label. This option is useful for scaling data, such as showing values in terms of thousands or millions.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nLINE AND AREA CHARTS \nOn this page    \n * Discrete Line and Area Charts\n   \n * Continuous Line and Area Charts\n * Discrete Area Versus Continuous Area Charts Display\n * Use Cases\n * Customization Options\n * Examples\n * Limitations Line charts and area charts display information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. In area charts, the space beneath the line segments is filled in with color, whereas in line charts only the line segments are rendered with no additional coloring or shading. These charts facilitate visualizing data over a period of time (using time series data) and identifying trends and patterns across the entire data range. Line and area charts support visualizing both discrete and continuous data. \nDISCRETE LINE AND AREA CHARTS \nDiscrete line and area charts visualize categorical or binned data with some form of logical ordering, such as time. MongoDB Charts always aggregates values in discrete charts such that any number of documents can supply values to a given plotted point. A discrete chart would be useful to visualize a store's average annual sales over time. \nDISCRETE CHART ENCODING CHANNELS \nDiscrete line and area charts provide the following encoding channels: Encoding Channel\nDescription\nX Axis\nThe category encoding channel. MongoDB Charts renders a data point for each unique value from the field assigned to this encoding channel.\nY Axis The aggregation encoding channel. This channel dictates which field to aggregate on and the type of aggregation to perform. This ultimately dictates the position of each category's data point on the chart. Categories are defined by the X Axis encoding channel. \nNOTE You can aggregate upon multiple fields in your dataset to create multi-series charts. For more information, see Multiple Field Mappings. Series (Optional) Adds an additional category encoding channel to the visualization. When utilized, MongoDB Charts adds an additional line to the visualization for each unique value in this field. Use this field to map additional discrete categorical fields in your data, rather than multiple aggregated fields. \nNOTE This option is only available when there is a single field mapped to the Y Axis aggregation encoding channel. \n100% STACKED AREA CHARTS \n100% stacked area charts are a subtype of discrete area charts. In 100% stacked area charts, the total area shown is normalized to 100% and split into segments based on the category in the Series encoding channel. Each series is shown as a percentage of the whole. When using a traditional stacked area chart, it can be difficult to compare the proportions of each series to the whole if the total value of the chart segments greatly differ. 100% stacked charts make it easier to compare proportions of each series to the whole by showing relative percentages. For a detailed example, see the 100% Stacked Area Chart Example. \nCONTINUOUS LINE AND AREA CHARTS \nIn continuous line and area charts, every data point comes from a distinct document in the data source. Continuous charts do not support aggregation or binning. A continuous chart would be useful to visualize stock closing prices over time, assuming each closing price comes from a distinct document in the dataset. \nCONTINUOUS CHART ENCODING CHANNELS \nContinuous line and area charts provide the following encoding channels: Encoding Channel\nDescription\nX Axis\nMongoDB Charts renders a data point for the values in this field from each document in the collection.\nY Axis For each document in the data source, MongoDB Charts compares the value of this field against the X Axis field and plots the resulting value. \nNOTE You can add multiple value encoding channels to the chart's Y Axis to create multi-series charts. For more information, see Multiple Field Mappings. Series (Optional) Adds an additional category encoding channel to the visualization. When utilized, this field adds an additional line to the visualization for each unique value in this field. \nNOTE This option is only available when there is a single field mapped to the Y Axis aggregation encoding channel. \nSMART DATE LABELS FOR CONTINUOUS LINE AND AREA CHARTS \nSmart labels for dates are axis markers grouped by units of time to reduce repetition of information. They are generated automatically based on the range of the chart when a date type field is encoded on an X or Y value axis. Smart labels are enabled by default when dates fields are encoded on value axes on supported chart types. To toggle smart labels on and off:       1. Click the Customize tab above the encoding channels in the Chart Builder.  2. Expand the Fields section.  3. Select the desired field from the dropdown menu.  4.

\nDISCRETE AREA VERSUS CONTINUOUS AREA CHARTS DISPLAY \nDiscrete area charts are stacked, meaning MongoDB Charts plots each series above or below the others in the visualization. The chart shows the total aggregated value of all of the series, so you can easily see the proportion of each series in relation to the total. Continuous area charts are overlaid, meaning MongoDB Charts plots each series directly on top of one another in the visualization. \nUSE CASES \nLine charts and area charts are closely related and are both useful for depicting time series data and data with logical ordering. However, there are scenarios when it may be beneficial to use one chart type over the other.  * Consider using a line chart when creating multi-series charts where each series represents an isolated field. MongoDB Charts stacks multi-series area charts, as shown in this example, which results in a chart where the stacked totals appear to share a relationship contributing to a larger summed value. This may not be desireable depending on the specific relationships within the data fields.\n   \n   * The line chart displays the data from each series in-line with one another without stacking, which may provide a more accurate representation of the data as shown in the discrete line chart.  * Area charts are useful for showing an overall trend while also highlighting relative performances of individual components of that sum.\n   \n   * Consider using a discrete area chart when illustrating a part-to-whole relationship, such as tracking data metrics over time. An example of this might be showing revenue compared with expenses over the course of a year.\n   \n   * A continuous area chart would work in this scenario if you were less concerned with the summation of the two fields and instead wanted a more direct comparison of the fields against one another. \nTIP When your data does not have a logical order, consider instead using a bar or column chart to visualize your data. When the order of the data is not important, a bar or column chart can quickly highlight the highest and lowest values in the visualization, which may be more beneficial than suggesting the viewer read the chart from left to right as in a line or area chart. \nCUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS \nThe following customization options are specific to line and area charts. To see all available customization options, see Customize Charts. \nADJUST X-AXIS LABEL ANGLE \nYou can adjust the X-axis label angles in Discrete Area Chart with Multiple Series and Discrete Line Chart with Multiple Aggregated Fields charts.

In the General Customization section, set the Dash Styles per Series toggle switch to the desired setting. \nSHOW OR HIDE DATA VALUE LABELS \nYou can dictate whether Charts displays text labels for your data values.

Each document in the collection represents an individual sale with information on the item(s) sold and the customer conducting the purchase. This discrete area chart shows the distribution of customer ages throughout sales in the collection:  The X Axis field of customer.age plots the ages of the customers along the X axis. We direct to Charts to bin the ages into groups of 5. The Y Axis field of customer.age and aggregate option of count counts the occurrences of each age in the corresponding bin. Lastly, we apply the item.name field to the Series encoding channel to split the age area into segments displaying the count of each age group purchasing each store item. \nNOTE For more information on multi-series charts, see Multi-Series Charts. \n100% STACKED AREA CHART \nThe following chart visualizes data from a mock office supply store. Each document in the collection represents an individual sale with information on the item(s) sold and the customer conducting the purchase. This 100% stacked area chart shows the relative percentages of items sold on each date of the month:  The X Axis field of saleDate plots each sale according to its date. The Binning and Periodic settings are enabled, so Charts groups the dates into bins based on each date of the month. \nNOTE For more information on binning dates and the periodic setting, refer to the Bin Data page. The Y Axis field of _id runs a count aggregation to calculate the total number of sales that happened each day of the month. Since this is a 100% stacked chart, these values are all normalized to 100%, and are segmented by the Series encoding channel. The Series field of item.name segments the total chart area based on the name of the item sold. Since there may be multiple items in a single document, we Unwind this array to add each item to the visualization. This provides a clear picture of the relative percentages of items sold based on the date of the month. \nDISCRETE LINE CHART WITH MULTIPLE AGGREGATED FIELDS \nThe following chart visualizes data pertaining to movies. Each document in the collection represents a movie and contains general information about the film and ratings from various rating aggregators. This discrete line chart compares average Rotten Tomatoes tomato.meter ratings and average Metacritic ratings of films over time. Both ratings are on a scale from 0 - 100:  The X Axis field of year plots each film according to its release year. We direct to Charts to bin the years into groups of 5. The Y Axis fields of tomato.meter and metacritic along with the aggregate option of mean calculate and plot the average ratings of films from each group of 5 years. \nNOTE For more information on creating charts with multiple aggregated fields, see Multiple Field Mappings. \nCONTINUOUS LINE CHART USING TIME SERIES DATA \nThe following chart visualizes data pertaining to the usage of a solar-powered house battery.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nDATA TABLE \nOn this page    \n * Data Table Encoding Channels\n   \n * Use Cases\n * Customization Options\n * Examples\n * Limitations Data tables represent data in a tabular view, similar to a spreadsheet. Data tables split your data into categories, with each categorization field represented in the table columns. The unique categories are represented as the table rows, and Charts displays aggregated values in the table body based on the fields selected. \nDATA TABLE ENCODING CHANNELS \nData tables use the following encoding channels: Encoding Channel\nDescription\nGroups The category encoding channels. Charts creates a row in the table for each unique value in this field. When multiple Groups are added to the chart, Charts creates a row for each unique combination of group fields. \nNOTE The Groups encoding channel supports binning for numeric and date fields. Values\nThe aggregation encoding channels. Charts creates a column for each field mapped into the Values channel. Charts aggregates the encoded Values fields using the selected aggregation methods and populates the grid cells with the aggregated value for the corresponding Group.\nDynamic Columns A second Category encoding channel. When you use Dynamic Columns, Charts creates table columns based on the unique values retrieved from the field mapped into the Dynamic Columns channel. Charts uses the field mapped into the Values channel to populate the grid cells, aggregated against both the Group and Dynamic Column categories. You cannot apply dynamic columns to a table if you have selected multiple Value encoding channels. For an example of how to use dynamic columns, see the following example. \nNOTE The Dynamic Columns encoding channel supports binning for numeric and date fields. \nUSE CASES \nData tables have a wide variety of applications, but are most useful when comparing multiple categories of calculated values. Visual charts struggle to display multiple categories of data without losing their audience. Data tables present data with multiple categories such that you can see which value applies to which slice of data. Data tables are also useful for showing precise data values, rather than comparing approximate values. Comparing approximate values is best done with a visual representation, instead of text. You can use data tables to show:      * The total cost to rent an apartment, including rent, cleaning fees, and security deposits organized by location and total area of the unit.  * Time spent working out and total calories burned during various exercises categorized by the type of exercise and time of day the exercised was performed. \nCUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS \nThe following customization options are specific to data table charts. To see all available customization options, see Customize Charts. \nWRAP TEXT \nYou can wrap text that does fit in a single data cell across multiple lines. This setting is off by default. To turn it on:  1. Select the Customize tab of the Chart Builder.  2. Expand the Fields section.  3. Select your desired field from the dropdown menu.  4. Toggle the Wrap Text switch to enable this feature. \nPIN COLUMNS \nYou can pin Group and Row Total columns to the side of the data table. A pinned column remains fixed in place while the rest of the table scrolls. To pin a column, hover over the column you want to pin and click the button in the column header. The button toggles on and the column pins to the side of the data table:  * A Group column pins to the left of any unpinned columns.  * The Row Total column pins to the right of any unpinned columns. To unpin a column, click the button in the header of the column you want to unpin. The button toggles off and if the column is a Group column, it moves to the right of any pinned Group columns. \nCONDITIONAL FORMATTING \nYou can create styling rules for table cell values that match conditions you define. Conditional formatting rules affect the look of your chart dynamically: if the value of a table cell changes to match or stop matching your conditions, its styling updates to reflect that. To learn how to use conditional formatting rules, see the Conditional Formatting customization option. \nEXAMPLES \nThe following data table examples visualize data from a hospitality and property service. Each document in the collection represents a unit available for rent and includes information such as the monthly unit price, neighborhood, and property type. \nBASIC DATA TABLE \nThe following data table categorizes the rental listings by property type and location, and shows the average review rating and average weekly rent for each group:  The Group encoding channels of property_type and

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nCOMBO CHARTS \nOn this page    \n * Combo Chart Encoding Channels\n   \n * Combo Chart Types\n * Use Cases\n * Customization Options\n * Examples\n * Limitations Combo charts offer a combined column and line view. \nCOMBO CHART ENCODING CHANNELS \nCombo charts provide the following encoding channels: Encoding Channel\nDescription\nX Axis\nIn the category axis encoding channel, a column is rendered for each unique value from this field.\nColumns\n     * The fields that you use in this channel build the columns in this chart.  * The aggregation axis encoding channel dictates which field to aggregate on and the type of aggregation to perform. This ultimately dictates the size of each column. \nNOTE You can map multiple fields to this channel to create a multi-series chart. However, unlike other charts, you can't create a multi-series chart with the Series channel on combo charts. To learn more, see Multiple Field Mappings. Lines  * The fields that you use in this channel build one or more lines on this chart.  * The aggregation axis encoding channel dictates which field to aggregate on and the type of aggregation to perform. \nCOMBO CHART TYPES \nCombo charts provide the following sub-types: Sub-Type Name\nDescription\nGrouped\nMongoDB Charts groups data by the category specified in the category encoding channel, and plots a column for each value in the Columns encoding channel.\nStacked\nMongoDB Charts creates a column for each distinct value in the category encoding channel field, and splits each column into segments based on the the Columns encoding channel. \nUSE CASES \n * Combo charts bring together the useful aspects of both column and line charts into a single chart. \nCUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS \nThe following customization options are specific to combo charts. To see all available customization options, see Customize Charts. \nNOTE If the columns and lines in your combo use different scales, consider a Secondary Y Axis. This option appears on the Customize pane in the Fields section for any fields mapped to the Lines channel. Fields mapped to the Columns channel appear only on the primary axis. \nADJUST X-AXIS LABEL ANGLE \nYou can adjust the X-axis label angle. You can choose one of the following options: Option\nDescription\nVertical\nLabels right-aligned at a 270 degree angle.\nHorizonal\nLabels center-aligned at a 0 degree angle.\nDiagonal\nLabels right-aligned at a 315 degree angle. To set this option:  1. Open the Customize pane for your chart.  2.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nDONUT CHART \nOn this page    \n * Donut Chart Encoding Channels\n   \n * Use Cases\n * Customization Options\n * Examples\n * Limitations Donut Charts display data in a series of segments of a circle, with larger segments representing larger data values. The entire circle represents the sum of all data values, and each segment indicates the proportion of each category in the data to the total. \nDONUT CHART ENCODING CHANNELS \nDonut charts provide the following encoding channels: Encoding Channel\nDescription\nLabel The category encoding channel. MongoDB Charts creates a segment in the donut for each unique value from this field. \nNOTE The Label encoding channel supports binning for numeric and date fields. The channel supports sorting and limiting for string fields. Arc The aggregation encoding channel. MongoDB Charts aggregates this field based on the aggregation method selected. This field dictates the size of each circle segment. If you don't add a field to the Label channel, you can add multiple fields to the Arc channel. MongoDB Charts creates one segment for each encoded field. \nUSE CASES \nDonut charts are ideal for giving readers a quick overview of the proportional distribution of a dataset. Use donut charts when the general trend of data is more important than precise data values. Donut charts are especially useful when there is a low number of categories to visualize, because it is easier to compare fewer segments of the circle to see which values make up the greatest parts of the whole. Consider using donut charts to display:      * The proportion of store customers who place orders in-store versus online  * The proportion of various resources exported by a country  * The choices thrown during several Rock, Paper, Scissors games \nNOTE Although you can limit your data to reduce the number of categories in the visualization, this may not be the best choice for donut charts. The purpose of donut charts is to show each value as a proportion of a total, so excluding categories may result in a misleading visualization that reflects inaccurate proportions. If you do limit your data, donut charts enable the Show \"All Others\" option by default. This option creates an \"All others\" category that represents the sum of the omitted values and ensures that chart values are displayed as a proportion of the total. When looking to compare individual data values, rather than show values as a proportion to a whole, consider using a column or bar chart. \nCUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS \nThe following customization options are specific to donut charts. To see all available customization options, see Customize Charts. \nSHOW OR HIDE CATEGORY LABELS \nYou can dictate whether Charts displays text labels for categories in your donut charts. To set this option:  1. Open the Customize pane for your chart.  2. In the General Customization section, set the Data Category Labels toggle switch to the desired setting. \nNOTE When you enable one or both of the Data Value Labels or Data Category Labels settings on a Donut Chart with many categories, MongoDB Charts only renders labels for the highest value categories. \nSHOW OR HIDE DATA VALUE LABELS \nYou can dictate whether Charts displays text labels for your data values. Data value labels show the exact values of your data points. To set this option:  1. Open the Customize pane for your chart.  2. In the General Customization section, set the Data Value Labels toggle switch to the desired setting. To customize the formatting of the number in the data label, modify the Number Formatting settings for the relevant field. \nNOTE When used with stacked column and bar charts, data labels show the sum of all series in each column or bar. \nSHOW VALUE OR PERCENTAGE LABELS \nYou can dictate whether a Donut Chart displays data values as raw values or percentages. By default, data value labels show the raw values of your data points. For percentage values in Donut Charts, the whole value is the total value of the entire chart. Percentage labels are always rounded to one decimal place, and do not adhere to Number Formatting settings. To set this option:  1. Open the Customize pane for your chart.  2. In the General Customization section, set the Data Value Labels toggle switch to on if off.  3. Select Show Value or Show Percentage from the drop-down. \nEXAMPLES  DONUT CHART USING COUNT \nThe following chart visualizes sales data from a mock office supply store.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nGAUGE CHART \nOn this page    \n * Gauge Chart Encoding Channels\n   \n * Target and Maximum Interaction\n * Use Cases\n * Cutomization Options\n * Examples Gauge Charts display data as a percentage of a semicircle, with customizable minimum and maximum values. Optionally you may also specify a Target value, which renders as a heavy line within the gauge's range. \nGAUGE CHART ENCODING CHANNELS \nGauge charts provide the following encoding channels: Encoding Channel\nDescription\nValue\nThe data value for the chart. Each gauge chart can have only one data value. Required\nTarget A specific value of importance to the chart, such as a sales quota or maximum capacity level. If no maximum value for the chart is set, the Target value serves as the upper limit for the chart. See Target and Maximum Interaction for more information on how the maximum range of the gauge is determined. If you wish to set a specific value as the chart target, you can create a calculated field, assign it your desired value, and encode it in the Target channel. \nNOTE The Target channel is an aggregation. To set a specific arbitrary value, set your calculated field to a constant value and choose either Max or Min from the Aggregate dropdown menu. \nTARGET AND MAXIMUM INTERACTION \nThe value encoded in the Target channel and the Maximum customization affect each others' behavior. The followling table explains the effect on the chart of having one, both, or neither of the values set. Target\nMaximum\nBehavior\nNone\nDefault\nNo target line. Gauge maximum is the next power of 10 above the value of the Value channel.\nNone\nCustom\nNo target line. Gauge maximum is the specified value.\nEncoded\nDefault\nTarget line is rendered. Gauge maximum matches the target value.\nEncoded\nCustom\nTarget line is rendered.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nCHOROPLETH CHART \nOn this page    \n * Regions\n   \n * Choropleth Chart Encoding Channels\n * Use Cases\n * Customization Options\n * Examples\n * Limitations Choropleth charts are maps that use shading to depict differences across regions. The shading of a region (e.g. states, countries) is based on an aggregated value and is proportional to the corresponding value of other regions. Unlike other geospatial charts, choropleths do not require coordinate data in your collections. Instead you can have names of regions as strings, so long as the region strings correspond to the names used in a supported Shape Scheme. \nREGIONS \nTo help define regions, MongoDB Charts provides Shape Schemes. For example, with the US States scheme, you can define regions at a state level, and your location field value must be one of the 50 states. \nCHOROPLETH CHART ENCODING CHANNELS \nChoropleth charts use the following encoding channels: Encoding Channel\nDescription\nLocation \nDefines the regions to be shaded on the map. The value must match (case insensitive) a region value for the selected Shape Scheme. For example, when using the US States scheme, the region of California matches california and CA as well as California. For a complete list of shape schemes and their expected values, refer to the Shape Schemes page. Color Defines the Aggregation that determines the shading of the corresponding Location. You can customize the range of colors that corresponds to the relative aggregated values. \nUSE CASES \nChoropleth charts can be used to depict differences in your selected aggregated field between geographic subregions, such as states or countries. They are useful when you have a dataset with clearly defined subregions compatible with one of the Shape Schemes MongoDB Charts provides. A choropleth chart is a good choice to compare:      * Population density across US states.  * Annual rainfall across European countries.  * Number of cellphone towers across Australian states. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: If you are looking for a chart to depict exact values rather than a high-level comparison, consider using a Data Table. \nCUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS \nThe following customization options are specific to choropleth charts. For general customization options, see Customize Charts. \nAUTOMATICALLY SET VIEWPORT \nBy default, geospatial charts show a map which includes all the data point markers in your specified collection. You can pan and zoom to change the map view, but if you close the chart and re-open it the map reverts to its default state. This behavior is controlled by the Automatically Set Viewport option. When you toggle the Automatically Set Viewport switch to Off, the area and zoom level at which the map is saved becomes the new default view. \nNOTE You can pan and zoom the map area in a chart on a dashboard, but these changes do not affect the default map view. \nOPACITY \nThe Opacity level of a map modifies the degree to which the chart's map data shows through the data point markers. Choropleth charts default to 100%. \nCUSTOM COLOR PALETTE \nThe color palette specifies the range of colors that corresponds to relative aggregated values in your map. Choropleth charts use a gradient color picker. To enable palette customization, toggle the Custom Color Palette switch in the General section. For more information, see Color Palette Customization. \nEXAMPLES \nThe following choropleth chart visualizes the total count of movie releases across various countries. Each document in the collection contains an array of countries where a particular movie was released.  In this chart, we specify a Shape Scheme of World Countries to divide the map into countries. The countries array in the Location field contains an array of elements representing each country where a movie was released. These elements match the values expected by the World Countries shape scheme. We unwind the array so each movie contributes to the count for each country where it was released. The Color field of id is aggregated by Count. As a result, each country is shaded based on its number of movies released. The custom color palatte for this chart ranges from yellow for lower ratings to dark red for higher ratings. Based on the visualization, we see that France, India, and Japan have relatively high movie release counts compared with other countries. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: For a complete list of choropleth Shape

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nGEOSPATIAL HEATMAP \nOn this page    \n * Geospatial Heatmap Encoding Channels\n   \n * Customization Options\n * Examples\n * Tutorials\n * Limitations You can use geospatial heatmap charts to visualize how geographic areas of a map compare to one another based on a given criterion. \nGEOSPATIAL HEATMAP ENCODING CHANNELS  COORDINATES \nA geopoint encoding channel which defines the map area of the chart. See the Geopoint reference page for more information about what types of data you can use in this channel. \nINTENSITY \nAn aggregation encoding channel that changes the shading of the colors in different chart regions to reflect the aggregated values of this field. More intense colors in the visualization reflect greater aggregated values. The radius customization option dictates the size of the data markers in Geospatial Heatmaps. The color of each data marker reflects the aggregated value of all data points within that marker's radius. \nEXAMPLE If ten data points exist within the specified radius, the color displayed is based on the aggregated value of those ten data points. \nNOTE Intensity shading is local to the map's current view. The most intense color is displayed for the most extreme aggregated values currently visible on the map, even if there are points outside the current view that are more extreme. \nLEGEND \nUnlike other types of charts, the legend and the chart colors on geospatial heatmaps change when the view changes. The color range is based on the data in the current view, and may change when you pan or zoom the map. \nCUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS \nThe following customization options are specific to geospatial heatmap charts. For general customization options, see Customize Charts. \nAUTOMATICALLY SET VIEWPORT \nBy default, geospatial charts show a map which includes all the data point markers in your specified collection. You can pan and zoom to change the map view, but if you close the chart and re-open it the map reverts to its default state. This behavior is controlled by the Automatically Set Viewport option. When you toggle the Automatically Set Viewport switch to Off, the area and zoom level at which the map is saved becomes the new default view. \nNOTE You can pan and zoom the map area in a chart on a dashboard, but these changes do not affect the default map view. \nRADIUS \nYou can adjust the radius of your data points. The radius is measured in pixels and defaults to 30. \nOPACITY \nThe Opacity level of a map modifies the degree to which the chart's map data shows through the data point markers. Geospatial heatmap charts default to 100%. \nCUSTOM COLOR PALETTE \nThe color palette specifies the range of colors that corresponds to relative aggregated values in your map. Geospatial heatmap charts use a gradient color picker. To enable palette customization, toggle the Custom Color Palette switch in the General section. For more information, see Color Palette Customization. \nEXAMPLES \nThe following chart is based on AirBnB data for the New York City area. It shows rental rate hot spots in a geospatial heatmap.  The Coordinates channel uses the location database field, which contains arrays of latitude-longitude pairs. The Intensity field uses the monthly_price database field, which contains monthly rental rates for each property in the database. \nTUTORIALS \nSee the following tutorials to build geospatial heatmap charts:      * Create a Geospatial Heatmap Chart Using GeoJSON Points  * Create a Geospatial Heatmap Chart Using Numeric or Numeric Array Fields \nPREREQUISITES \nThe tutorials on this page use the sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews and sample_geospatial.shipwrecks collections. Before starting, you must load the sample data on your cluster. To learn how to load the sample data provided by Atlas into your cluster, see Load Sample Data. \nCREATE A GEOSPATIAL HEATMAP CHART USING GEOJSON POINTS \nThis tutorial demonstrates how to create a geospatial heatmap chart with fields that are GeoJSON Points. The final chart displays a heatmap of average AirBnB prices in New York. \nNOTE Charts automatically determines if field types in your collection are GeoJSON Points by displaying the icon. You can map these fields directly to a geopoint channel type in the Chart Builder.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nWORD CLOUD \nOn this page    \n * Word Cloud Encoding Channels\n   \n * Use Cases\n * Examples\n * Limitations Word clouds visually represent text data, highlighting prevalent keywords and phrases. The frequency at which each word appears is reflected by the word's size. \nWORD CLOUD ENCODING CHANNELS \nWord clouds provide the following encoding channels: Encoding Channel\nChannel Type\nDescription\nText\nCategory The text values to add to the word cloud. Charts adds each unique value from the field applied to this channel to the word cloud. \nTIP Word clouds can display a maximum of 100 values. If the field applied to this channel contains more than 100 unique values, the chart shows a random sample of 100 values. To ensure that the chart only shows the most common words, you should apply a limit and sort by Value. Size\nAggregation\nDictates the field to aggregate on and the type of aggregation to perform. The results of the aggregation define the size of each Text value, with larger aggregated values resulting in larger text sizes.\nColor\nCategory\n(Optional) Colors each text value to indicate a corresponding data value from the applied field. \nUSE CASES \nUse word clouds to show the frequency of specific words or phrases in text fields. Word clouds provide a high-level view of common words and themes across a series of text data. They can also highlight the most common phrases from a known set of strings, such as product categories or tags. Consider using a word cloud to:      * Show common words and phrases used in reviews of a product.  * Identify common terms in existing content to improve SEO.  * Highlight specific customer pain points from aggregated user surveys. \nEXAMPLES \nWord clouds are commonly used to show the frequency of words appearing within long text fields. By default, word clouds do not split text fields into words, and instead attempt to visualize the entire text field as a single value. You can use an aggregation pipeline to split a text field into individual words. \nNOTE The dataset used in this tutorial is included in the sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews dataset provided by Atlas. The following example creates a word cloud from a dataset containing information on AirBnB rental properties. Each property listing contains a description field; a text field describing the property. First, we run an aggregation pipeline to pre-process the description field. The following aggregation pipeline:  1. Splits the description field into an array where each individual word is an array element.  2. Unwinds this array, creating a new document for each individual word from each description field.  3. Adds a new field called words to the collection, where each unwound word from the description becomes a value of words.  4.

Docs Home → MongoDB Charts \nGEOSPATIAL SCATTER CHART \nOn this page    \n * Geospatial Scatter Chart Encoding Channels\n   \n * Customization Options\n * Tutorials\n * Limitations Geospatial scatter charts distribute data from a data source across geographic locations, and, optionally, color the data points based on the database field of your choice and scale the size of data points. The sample images in the next section demonstrate how to construct a geospatial scatter chart to locate the neighborhoods in NYC with the most rooms available at a specified price. \nGEOSPATIAL SCATTER CHART ENCODING CHANNELS \nGeospatial scatter charts use the Coordinates, Color and Size encoding channels. \nCOORDINATES \nThe Coordinates encoding channel defines the map area of geospatial charts. The image below distributes all of the instances of the location geopoint in the Sample AirBnB Listings Dataset. However, all of the circles are green and the same size since we have not yet specified fields for the Size and Color encoding channels. \nNOTE Atlas provides several sample data sets for download. See the Geopoint reference page for more information about what types of data you can use in this channel.  \nCOLOR \n(Optional) The Color encoding channel changes the color of the data points to categorize the displayed geopoints by the value of the selected collection field. MongoDB Charts lists the colors used in a key to the right of the chart. In the image below, the property_type distributes the property types in NYC by color. The key to the right of the chart indicates green for guest suites and dark blue for apartments, for example. However, all of the circles are still the same size since we have not yet specified a field for the Size encoding channel.  \nSIZE \n(Optional) The Size aggregation encoding channel changes the size of the data point markers, with larger sizes indicating larger aggregated values. The image below uses the mean of the weekly_price collection field to aggregate all instances of the geopoint that you chose for the Coordinates encoding channel. The key to right of the chart indicates the aggregation value for the different circle sizes.  \nNOTE If no fields are encoded in the Size encoding channel, Charts displays all points with the same size. \nTOOLTIP DETAIL \n(Optional) The Tooltip Detail encoding channel adds the value of the selected field to each data point's tooltip. To view a data point tooltip, hover over that point in the chart. In addition to the Tooltip Detail field, the tooltip also shows other fields used to construct the chart. For example, the following chart encodes the Summary field as a Tooltip Detail:  \nCUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS \nThe following customization options are specific to geospatial scatter charts. For general customization options, see Customize Charts. \nAUTOMATICALLY SET VIEWPORT \nBy default, geospatial charts show a map which includes all the data point markers in your specified collection. You can pan and zoom to change the map view, but if you close the chart and re-open it the map reverts to its default state. This behavior is controlled by the Automatically Set Viewport option. When you toggle the Automatically Set Viewport switch to Off, the area and zoom level at which the map is saved becomes the new default view. \nNOTE You can pan and zoom the map area in a chart on a dashboard, but these changes do not affect the default map view. \nOPACITY \nThe Opacity level of a map modifies the degree to which the chart's map data shows through the data point markers. Geospatial scatter charts default to 20%. \nSTROKE THICKNESS \nYou can set the Stroke Thickness, measured in pixels, of the map's data point markers. The default is 2. \nCUSTOM COLOR PALETTE \nThe color palette specifies the range of colors that corresponds to relative aggregated values in your map. Geospatial scatter charts use a discrete color picker. To enable palette customization, toggle the Custom Color Palette switch in the General section. For more information, see Color Palette Customization. \nTUTORIALS \nSee the following tutorials to build geospatial scatter charts:      * Create a Geospatial Scatter Chart Using GeoJSON Points  *

The final chart displays a scatter chart of shipwrecks across the world. 1 ADD A GEOSPATIAL SCATTER CHART TO YOUR DASHBOARD. \n a. From the Dashboards page, select the dashboard where you want to add a new chart. For instructions on setting up a dashboard, see Dashboards.  b. Click Add Chart.  c. In the Select Data Source modal, click the Project tab.  d. In the cluster where you loaded the sample data, select the shipwrecks collection in the sample_geospatial database.  e. In the Chart Type dropdown, click Geo Scatter. For more details, see Create a Chart. 2 ADD FIELDS TO YOUR CHART. \n a. Select the Encode tab.  b. Navigate to the Fields pane on the left side of the Chart Builder. This section lists all available fields in the shipwrecks collection.  c. Drag the coordinates numeric array field to the Coordinates encoding channel.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    Alternatively, you can specify the latitude and longitude coordinates separately. First, drag the latdec numeric field to the Coordinates encoding channel. Once the Longitude channel appears, drag the londec numeric field to the corresponding channel.  d.
