[{"url":"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/compatibility/","chunkOrder":1,"text":" Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nCOMPATIBILITY  MONGODB COMPATIBILITY  MONGODB KAFKA SINK CONNECTOR \nThe MongoDB Kafka sink connector requires MongoDB v3.6 or later. \nMONGODB KAFKA SOURCE CONNECTOR \nThe MongoDB Kafka source connector requires MongoDB v3.6 or later. If you are using MongoDB v3.6, the connector can only listen for changes on collections. If you need the connector to listen for changes on a database or deployment, you must use MongoDB v4.0 or later. \nNOTE We recommend that you only use the MongoDB Kafka Connector with an official version of the MongoDB server. We cannot guarantee it functions correctly with any other version. \nKAFKA COMPATIBILITY \nThe MongoDB Kafka Connector requires Confluent Kafka Connect v2.1.0 or later. It's tested against Apache Kafka v2.3 and later. You can use the Kafka Connect service with several Apache Kafka compatible platforms including the following:      * Confluent Platform v5.3 or later  * Microsoft Azure Event Hubs  * Red Hat AMQ Streams The connector works directly with Kafka Connect. The connector does not connect directly to a Kafka cluster which means it's compatible with any Apache Kafka platform that supports Kafka Connect.

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nMIGRATE FROM KAFKA CONNECT MONGODB \nUse this guide to migrate your Kafka deployments from the community-created Kafka Connect MongoDB sink connector to the official MongoDB Kafka connector. The following sections list the changes you must make to your Kafka Connect sink connector configuration settings and custom classes to transition to the MongoDB Kafka sink connector. \nUPDATE CONFIGURATION SETTINGS \nMake the following changes to the configuration settings of your Kafka Connect deployment before using them with your MongoDB Kafka connector deployment:      * Replace values that include the package at.grahsl.kafka.connect.mongodb with the package com.mongodb.kafka.connect.  * Replace your connector.class setting with the MongoDB Kafka sink connector class.\n   \n   connector.class=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSinkConnector\n   \n     * Remove the mongodb. prefix from your Kafka Connect property names. For example, change mongodb.connection.uri to connection.uri.  * Remove the document.id.strategies setting if it exists. If the value of this setting reference custom strategies, move them to the document.id.strategy setting. Read the Update Custom Classes section to discover what changes you must make to your custom classes.  * Replace any property names you use to specify per-topic or collection overrides that contain the mongodb.collection prefix with the equivalent key in sink connector Kafka topic configuration topic properties. \nUPDATE CUSTOM CLASSES \nIf you use any custom classes in your Kafka Connect sink connector deployment, make the following changes to them before adding them to your MongoDB Kafka connector deployment:  * Replace imports that include at.grahsl.kafka.connect.mongodb with com.mongodb.kafka.connect.  * Replace references to the MongoDbSinkConnector class with the MongoSinkConnector class.  * Update custom sink connector strategy classes to implement the com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.IdStrategy interface.  * Update references to the MongoDbSinkConnectorConfig class. In the MongoDB Kafka connector, the logic from that class is split into the following classes:\n   \n   * MongoSinkConfig\n   \n   * MongoSinkTopicConfig \nUPDATE POST PROCESSOR SUBCLASSES \nIf you

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nQUICK START \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Install the Required Packages\n * Download the Sandbox\n * Start the Sandbox\n * Add Connectors\n * Add a Source Connector\n * Add a Sink Connector\n * Send the Contents of a Document through Your Connectors\n * Remove the Sandbox\n * Next Steps \nOVERVIEW \nThis guide shows you how to configure the MongoDB Kafka Connector to send data between MongoDB and Apache Kafka. After completing this guide, you should understand how to use the Kafka Connect REST API to configure MongoDB Kafka Connectors to read data from MongoDB and write it to a Kafka topic, and to read data from a Kafka topic and write it to MongoDB. To complete the steps in this guide, you must download and work in a sandbox, a containerized development environment that includes services you need to build a sample data pipeline. Read the following sections to set up your sandbox and sample data pipeline. \nNOTE After you complete this guide, you can remove the environment by following the instructions in the Remove the Sandbox section. \nINSTALL THE REQUIRED PACKAGES \nDownload and install the following packages:      * Docker  * Git \nTIP \nREAD THE DOCKER DOCUMENTATION This guide uses the following Docker-specific terminology:  * Container  * Image Learn more about Docker from the Docker official Get Started Guide. The sandbox uses Docker for convenience and consistency. To learn more about deployment options for Apache Kafka, see the following resources:  * Official Apache Kafka Quick Start  * Official Install Confluent Platform Guide \nDOWNLOAD THE SANDBOX \nWe created a sandbox that includes the services you need in this tutorial to build your sample data pipeline. To download the sandbox, clone the tutorial repository to your development environment. Then navigate to the directory that corresponds to the quickstart tutorial. If you use bash or a similar shell, use the following commands: git clone https://github.com/mongodb-university/kafka-edu.gitcd kafka-edu/docs-examples/mongo-kafka-base  \nSTART THE SANDBOX \nThe sandbox starts the following services in Docker containers:  * MongoDB, configured as a replica set  * Apache Kafka  * Kafka Connect with the MongoDB Kafka Connector installed  * Apache Zookeeper which manages the configuration for Apache Kafka To start the sandbox run the following command from the tutorial directory: docker-compose -p mongo-kafka up -d  When you start the sandbox, Docker downloads any images it needs to run. \nNOTE \nHOW LONG DOES THE DOWNLOAD TAKE? In total, the Docker images for this tutorial require about 2.4 GB of space. The following list shows how long it takes to download the images with different internet speeds:  * 40 megabits per second: 8 minutes  * 20 megabits per second: 16 minutes  * 10 megabits per second: 32 minutes After Docker downloads and builds the images, you should see the following output in your development environment: ...Creating zookeeper ... doneCreating broker    ... doneCreating schema-registry ... doneCreating connect         ... doneCreating rest-proxy      ... doneCreating mongo1          ... doneCreating mongo1-setup    ... done \nNOTE \nPORT MAPPINGS The sandbox maps the following services to ports on your host machine:  * The sandbox MongoDB server maps to port 35001 on your host machine  * The sandbox Kafka Connect JMX server maps to port 35000 on your host machine These ports must be free to start the sandbox. \nADD CONNECTORS \nTo complete the sample data pipeline, you must add connectors to Kafka Connect to transfer data between Kafka Connect and MongoDB. Add a source connector to transfer data from MongoDB to Apache Kafka. Add a sink connector to transfer data from Apache Kafka to MongoDB. To add connectors in the sandbox, first start an interactive bash shell in your Docker container using the following command: docker exec -it mongo1 /bin/bash  After your shell session starts, you should see the following prompt: MongoDB Kafka Connector Sandbox $ \nADD A SOURCE CONNECTOR \nUse the shell in your Docker container to add a source connector using the Kafka Connect REST API. The following API request adds a source connector configured with the following properties:  * The class Kafka Connect uses to instantiate the connector  * The connection URI, database, and collection of the MongoDB replica set from which the connector reads data  * An aggregation pipeline that adds a field travel with the value \"MongoDB Kafka Connector\" to inserted documents the connector reads

 \nNOTE \nWHY DO I SEE THE MESSAGE 'FAILED TO CONNECT'? It takes up to three minutes for the Kafka Connect REST API to start. If you receive the following error, wait three minutes and run the preceding command again: ...curl: (7) Failed to connect to connect port 8083: Connection refused To confirm that you added the source connector, run the following command: curl -X GET http://connect:8083/connectors  The preceding command should output the names of the running connectors: [\"mongo-source\"] To learn more about source connector properties, see the page on Source Connector Configuration Properties. To learn more about aggregation pipelines, see the MongoDB manual page on Aggregation Pipelines. \nADD A SINK CONNECTOR \nUse the shell in your Docker container to add a sink connector using the Kafka Connect REST API. The following API request adds a sink connector configured with the following properties:  * The class Kafka Connect uses to instantiate the connector  * The connection URI, database, and collection of the MongoDB replica set to which the connector writes data  * The Apache Kafka topic from which the connector reads data  * A change data capture handler for MongoDB change event documents curl -X POST \\     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\     --data '     {\"name\": \"mongo-sink\",      \"config\": {         \"connector.class\":\"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSinkConnector\",         \"connection.uri\":\"mongodb://mongo1:27017/?replicaSet=rs0\",         \"database\":\"quickstart\",         \"collection\":\"topicData\",         \"topics\":\"quickstart.sampleData\",         \"change.data.capture.handler\": \"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.cdc.mongodb.ChangeStreamHandler\"         }     }     ' \\     http://connect:8083/connectors -w \"\\n\"  To confirm that you added both source and sink connector, run the following command: curl -X GET http://connect:8083/connectors  The preceding command should output the names of the running connectors: [\"mongo-source\", \"mongo-sink\"] To learn more about sink connector properties, see the page on Sink Connector Configuration Properties. To learn more about change data capture events, see the Change Data Capture Handlers guide. \nSEND THE CONTENTS OF A DOCUMENT THROUGH YOUR CONNECTORS \nTo send the contents of a document through your connectors, insert a document into the MongoDB collection from which your source connector reads data. To insert a new document into your collection, enter the MongoDB shell from the shell in your Docker container using the following command: mongosh mongodb://mongo1:27017/?replicaSet=rs0  After you run the preceding command, you should see the following prompt: rs0 [primary] test> From the MongoDB shell, insert a document into the sampleData collection of the quickstart database using the following commands: use quickstartdb.sampleData.insertOne({\"hello\":\"world\"})  After you insert a document into the sampleData collection, confirm that your connectors processed the change. Check the contents of the topicData collection using the following command: db.topicData.find()  You should see output that resembles the following: [    {      _id: ObjectId(...),      hello: 'world',      travel: 'MongoDB Kafka Connector'    }] Exit the MongoDB shell with the following command: exit  \nREMOVE THE SANDBOX \nTo conserve resources in your development environment, remove the sandbox. Before you remove the sandbox, exit from the shell session in your Docker container by running the following command: exit  You can choose to remove both the Docker containers and images, or exclusively the containers. If you remove the containers and images, you must download them again to restart your sandbox which is approximately 2.4 GB in size. If you exclusively remove the containers, you can reuse the images and avoid downloading most of the large files in the sample data pipeline. Select the tab that corresponds to the removal task you want to run.

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nHOW TO CONTRIBUTE \nWe are happy to accept contributions to help improve the MongoDB Kafka Connector. We guide community contributions to ensure they meet the standards of the codebase. Please ensure that your pull request meets the following criteria:      * Includes documentation comments describing your feature  * Includes unit tests that cover the functionality of your feature  * Passes the Gradle check task, which includes the following tasks:\n   \n   a. test task\n   \n   b. integrationTest task\n   \n   c. spotlessCheck task To get started, check out the source code and create a branch by running the following commands in your shell: git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-kafka.gitcd mongo-kafkagit checkout -b <your branch name>  Once you push your changes to your feature branch, make sure it passes the Gradle checks. You can run the checks with the following command: ./gradlew clean check --continue -Dorg.mongodb.test.uri=<your local mongodb replica set connection uri>  \nIMPORTANT \nINTEGRATION TESTS You must have a local MongoDB replica set running to perform Gradle integration tests. To learn how to set up a MongoDB replica set, see Deploy a Replica Set in the MongoDB manual. \nNOTE \nSKIPPED TESTS You can skip tests in the integrationTest task related to the following areas unless your code specifically modifies connector behavior related to these areas:  * Specific versions of MongoDB  * Authentication You can run the authentication tests by enabling authentication in your local MongoDB replica set and specifying your credentials in your connection URI. To learn how to enable authentication in a replica set, see Deploy Replica Set With Keyfile Authentication in the MongoDB manual.

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nSOURCE CONNECTOR \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Configuration Properties\n * Usage Examples\n * Fundamentals \nOVERVIEW \nThis section focuses on the MongoDB Kafka source connector. The source connector is a Kafka Connect connector that reads data from MongoDB and writes data to Apache Kafka. The source connector works by opening a single change stream with MongoDB and sending data from that change stream to Kafka Connect. Your source connector maintains its change stream for the duration of its runtime, and your connector closes its change stream when you stop it. \nCONFIGURATION PROPERTIES \nTo learn about configuration options for your source connector, see the Configuration Properties section. \nUSAGE EXAMPLES \nTo view examples of source connector configurations, see the Usage Examples section.

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nCOPY EXISTING DATA \nThis usage example demonstrates how to copy data from a MongoDB collection to an Apache Kafka topic using the MongoDB Kafka source connector. \nEXAMPLE \nSuppose you need to copy a MongoDB collection to Apache Kafka and filter some of the data. Your requirements and your solutions are as follows: Requirement\nSolution\nCopy the customers collection of the shopping database in your MongoDB deployment onto an Apache Kafka topic.\nSee the Copy Data section of this guide.\nOnly copy documents that have the value \"Mexico\" in the country field.\nSee the Filter Data section of this guide. The customers collection contains the following documents: {  \"_id\": 1,  \"country\": \"Mexico\",  \"purchases\": 2,  \"last_viewed\": { \"$date\": \"2021-10-31T20:30:00.245Z\" }}{  \"_id\": 2,  \"country\": \"Iceland\",  \"purchases\": 8,  \"last_viewed\": { \"$date\": \"2015-07-20T10:00:00.135Z\" }} \nCOPY DATA \nCopy the contents of the customers collection of the shopping database by specifying the following configuration options in your source connector: database=shoppingcollection=customersstartup.mode=copy_existing  Your source connector copies your collection by creating change event documents that describe inserting each document into your collection. \nNOTE \nDATA COPY CAN PRODUCE DUPLICATE EVENTS If any system changes the data in the database while the source connector converts existing data from it, MongoDB may produce duplicate change stream events to reflect the latest changes. Since the change stream events on which the data copy relies are idempotent, the copied data is eventually consistent. To learn more about change event documents, see the Change Streams guide. To learn more about the startup.mode option, see Startup Properties. \nFILTER DATA \nYou can filter data by specifying an aggregation pipeline in the startup.mode.copy.existing.pipeline option of your source connector configuration. The following configuration specifies an aggregation pipeline that matches all documents with \"Mexico\" in the country field: startup.mode.copy.existing.pipeline=[{ \"$match\": { \"country\": \"Mexico\" } }]  To learn more about the startup.mode.copy.existing.pipeline option, see Startup Properties. To learn more about aggregation pipelines, see the following resources:      * Customize a Pipeline to Filter Change Events Usage Example  * Aggregation in the MongoDB manual. \nSPECIFY THE CONFIGURATION \nYour final source connector configuration to copy the customers collection should look like this: connector.class=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnectorconnection.uri=<your production MongoDB connection uri>database=shoppingcollection=customersstartup.mode=copy_existingstartup.mode.copy.existing.pipeline=[{ \"$match\": { \"country\": \"Mexico\" } }]  Once your connector copies your data, you see the following change event document corresponding to the preceding sample collection in the shopping.customers Apache Kafka topic: {  \"_id\": { \"_id\": 1, \"copyingData\": true },  \"operationType\": \"insert\",  \"documentKey\": { \"_id\": 1 },  \"fullDocument\": {    \"_id\": 1,    \"country\": \"Mexico\",    \"purchases\": 2,    \"last_viewed\": { \"$date\": \"2021-10-31T20:30:00.245Z\" }  },  \"ns\": { \"db\": \"shopping\", \"coll\": \"customers\" }} \nNOTE \nWRITE THE DATA IN YOUR TOPIC INTO A COLLECTION Use a change data capture handler to convert change event documents in an Apache Kafka topic into MongoDB write operations.

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nSPECIFY A SCHEMA \nThis usage example demonstrates how you can configure your MongoDB Kafka source connector to apply a custom schema to your data. A schema is a definition that specifies the structure and type information about data in an Apache Kafka topic. Use a schema when you need to ensure the data on the topic populated by your source connector has a consistent structure. To learn more about using schemas with the connector, see the Apply Schemas guide. \nEXAMPLE \nSuppose your application keeps track of customer data in a MongoDB collection, and you need to publish this data to a Kafka topic. You want the subscribers of the customer data to receive consistently formatted data. You choose to apply a schema to your data. Your requirements and your solutions are as follows: Requirement\nSolution\nReceive customer data from a MongoDB collection\nConfigure a MongoDB source connector to receive updates to data from a specific database and collection.\nSee Receive Data from a Collection.\nProvide the customer data schema\nSpecify a schema that corresponds to the structure and data types of the customer data.\nSee Create a Custom Schema.\nOmit Kafka metadata from the customer data\nInclude only the data from the fullDocument field.\nSee Omit Metadata from Published Records. For the full configuration file that meets the requirements above, see Specify the Configuration. \nRECEIVE DATA FROM A COLLECTION \nTo configure your source connector to receive data from a MongoDB collection, specify the database and collection name. For this example, you can configure the connector to read from the purchases collection in the customers database as follows: database=customerscollection=purchases  \nCREATE A CUSTOM SCHEMA \nA sample customer data document from your collection contains the following information: {  \"name\": \"Zola\",  \"visits\": [    {      \"$date\": \"2021-07-25T17:30:00.000Z\"    },    {      \"$date\": \"2021-10-03T14:06:00.000Z\"    }  ],  \"goods_purchased\": {    \"apples\": 1,    \"bananas\": 10  }}  From the sample document, you decide your schema should present the fields using the following data types: Field name\nData types\nDescription\nname\nstring\nName of the customer\nvisits\narray of timestamps\nDates the customer visited\ngoods_purchased\nmap of string (the assumed type) to integer values\nNames of goods and quantity of each item the customer purchased You can describe your data using the Apache Avro schema format as shown in the example schema below: {  \"type\": \"record\",  \"name\": \"Customer\",  \"fields\": [{      \"name\": \"name\",      \"type\": \"string\"    },{      \"name\": \"visits\",      \"type\": {        \"type\": \"array\",        \"items\": {          \"type\": \"long\",          \"logicalType\": \"timestamp-millis\"        }      }    },{      \"name\": \"goods_purchased\",      \"type\": {        \"type\": \"map\",        \"values\": \"int\"      }    }  ]}  \nIMPORTANT \nCONVERTERS If you want to send your data through Apache Kafka with Avro binary encoding, you must use an Avro converter. For more information, see the guide on Converters. \nOMIT METADATA FROM PUBLISHED RECORDS \nThe connector publishes the customer data documents and metadata that describes the document to a Kafka topic. You can set the connector to include only the document data contained in the fullDocument field of the record using the following setting: publish.full.document.only=true  For more information on the

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nLISTEN FOR CHANGES ON MULTIPLE SOURCES \nThis usage example demonstrates how to configure a MongoDB Kafka source connector to listen for change events on multiple MongoDB collections, and publish them to a Kafka topic. If you need your connector to listen for change events on a more particular set of databases and collections, you can use a pipeline. A pipeline is a MongoDB aggregation pipeline composed of instructions to the database to filter or transform data. See the next section for examples of how to configure your connector pipeline setting to match multiple database and collection names using a regular expression. \nNOTE The database and collection configuration settings also affect which databases and collections on which the connector listens for change events. To learn more about these settings, see the MongoDB Source Connection Properties guide. \nEXAMPLES \nThe following examples show you how to use an aggregation pipeline to select specific database or collection names on which to listen for change events. \nINCLUDE CHANGE EVENTS FROM MULTIPLE DATABASES \nYou can define an aggregation pipeline to select only change events on multiple databases by specifying the following in the pipeline setting:      * A $match aggregation operator  * The ns.db, field which identifies the database part of the namespace  * The $regex operator and a regular expression that matches the database names The following sample configuration shows how you can set your source connector to listen for change events on the sandbox and firewall databases: pipeline=[{\"$match\": {\"ns.db\": {\"$regex\": \"/^(sandbox|firewall)$/\"}}}]  \nEXCLUDE CHANGE EVENTS FROM MULTIPLE COLLECTIONS \nYou can define an aggregation pipeline to ignore change events on multiple collections by specifying the following in the pipeline setting:  * A $match aggregation operator  * The ns.coll field, which identifies the collection part of the namespace  * The $regex operator and a regular expression that matches the collection names  * The $not operator which instructs the enclosing $regex operator to match everything the regular expression does not match The following sample configuration shows how you can set your source connector to filter out change events that originate from all collections named \"hyperspace\" in any database: pipeline=[{\"$match\":

topic.namespace.map={\"myDb.myColl\": \"topicOne\", \"myDb\": \"topicTwo\"} The following examples show which topic the connector sends different change stream documents to using the preceding mapping:  * A change stream document originating from the myDb database and the myColl collection publishes to the topicOne topic.  * A change stream document originating from the myDb database and the newColl collection publishes to the topicTwo.newColl topic.  * A change stream document originating from dropping the myDb database, which does not bear a collection name, publishes to the topicTwo topic. You can use the \"*\" wildcard character to match change stream document namespaces. \nEXAMPLE The following mapping instructs the connector to publish all change stream documents to the topicThree topic: topic.namespace.map={\"*\": \"topicThree\"} Default: \"\"\nAccepted Values: A valid JSON object\ntopic.separator\nType: string \nDescription:\nSpecifies the string the connector uses to concatenate the values used to create the name of your topic. The connector publishes records to a topic with a name formed by concatenating the values of the following fields in the following order:  1. topic.prefix  2. database  3. collection  4. topic.suffix \nEXAMPLE The following configuration instructs the connector to publish change stream documents from the coll collection of the db database to the prefix-db-coll topic:    topic.prefix=prefix   database=db   collection=coll   topic.separator=- \nIMPORTANT \nTOPIC SEPARATOR AND TOPIC NAMESPACE MAP When you use the topic.separator property, keep in mind that it does not affect how you define the topic.namespace.map property. The topic.namespace.map property uses MongoDB namespaces which you must always specify with a \".\" character to separate the database and collection name.  Default: \".\"\nAccepted Values: A string\ntopic.mapper\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe Java class that defines your custom topic mapping logic. \nDefault: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.source.topic.mapping.DefaultTopicMapper\nAccepted Values: Valid full class name of an implementation of the TopicMapper class. \nCHANGE STREAMS \nUse the following configuration settings to specify aggregation pipelines for change streams and read preferences for change stream cursors when working with the MongoDB Kafka source connector. To view only the options related to change streams, see the Change Stream Properties page. Name\nDescription\npipeline\nType: string \nDescription:\nAn array of aggregation pipelines to run in your change stream. You must configure this setting for the change stream event document, not the fullDocument field. \nEXAMPLE [{\"$match\": { \"$and\": [{\"operationType\": \"insert\"}, {\"fullDocument.eventId\": 1404 }] } }]  \nTIP \nADDITIONAL EXAMPLES  * Customize a Pipeline to Filter Change Events  * Listen for Changes on Multiple Sources Default: []\nAccepted Values: Valid aggregation pipeline stage\nchange.stream.full.document\nType: string \nDescription:\nDetermines what values your change stream returns on update operations.\nThe default setting returns the differences between the original document and the updated document.\nThe updateLookup setting returns the differences between the original document and updated document as well as a copy of the entire updated document at a point in time after the update.\nThe whenAvailable setting returns the updated document, if available.\nThe required setting returns the updated document and raises an error if it is not available. \nTIP For more information on how this change stream option works, see the MongoDB server manual guide on Lookup Full Document for Update Operations.  Default: \"\"\nAccepted Values: \"\", \"updateLookup\", \"whenAvailable\", or \"required\"\nchange.stream.full.document.before.change\nType: string \nDescription:\nConfigures the document pre-image your change stream returns on update operations. The pre-image is not available for source records published while copying existing data, and the pre-image configuration has no effect on copying. \nTIP To learn how to configure a collection to enable pre-images, see the Server manual entry on pre- and post-images. The default setting suppresses the document pre-image.\nThe whenAvailable setting returns the document pre-image if it's available, before it was replaced, updated, or deleted.\nThe required setting

\nAccepted Values: A valid JSON schema\noutput.schema.infer.value\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nWhether the connector should infer the schema for the value document of the SourceRecord. Since the connector processes each document in isolation, the connector may generate many schemas. \nIMPORTANT The connector only reads this setting when you set your output.format.value setting to schema. Default: false\nAccepted Values: true or false \nSTARTUP \nUse the following configuration settings to configure startup of the MongoDB Kafka source connector to convert MongoDB collections into Change Stream events. To view only the options related to startup, see the Startup Properties page. Name\nDescription\nstartup.mode\nType: string \nDescription:\nSpecifies how the connector should start up when there is no source offset available. Resuming a change stream requires a resume token, which the connector gets from the source offset. If no source offset is available, the connector may either ignore all or some of the existing source data, or may at first copy all existing source data and then continue with processing new data. \nIf startup.mode=latest, the connector ignores all existing source data. \nIf startup.mode=timestamp, the connector actuates startup.mode.timestamp.* properties. If no properties are configured, timestamp is equivalent to latest. \nIf startup.mode=copy_existing, the connector copies all existing source data to Change Stream events. This setting is equivalent to the deprecated setting copy.existing=true. \nNOTE \nDATA COPY CAN PRODUCE DUPLICATE EVENTS If any system changes the data in the database while the source connector converts existing data from it, MongoDB may produce duplicate change stream events to reflect the latest changes. Since the change stream events on which the data copy relies are idempotent, the copied data is eventually consistent. Default:latest\nAccepted Values: latest, timestamp, copy_existing\nstartup.mode.timestamp.start.at.operation.time\nType: string \nDescription:\nActuated only if startup.mode=timestamp. Specifies the starting point for the change stream. To learn more about Change Stream parameters, see the Server manual entry.\nDefault: \"\"\nAccepted Values:  * An integer number of seconds since the Epoch in decimal format (for example, 30)  * An instant in the ISO-8601 format with one second precision (for example, 1970-01-01T00:00:30Z)  * A BSON Timestamp in the canonical extended JSON (v2) format (for example, {\"$timestamp\": {\"t\": 30, \"i\": 0}}) startup.mode.copy.existing.namespace.regex\nType: string \nDescription:\nRegular expression the connector uses to match namespaces from which to copy data. A namespace describes the MongoDB database name and collection separated by a period (for example, databaseName.collectionName). \nEXAMPLE In the following example, the regular-expression setting matches collections that start with \"page\" in the stats database. startup.mode.copy.existing.namespace.regex=stats\\.page.*  The \"\" character in the example above escapes the \".\" character that follows it in the regular expression. For more information on how to build regular expressions, see the Java API documentation on Patterns. Default: \"\"\nAccepted Values: A valid regular expression\nstartup.mode.copy.existing.pipeline\nType: string \nDescription:\nAn inline array of pipeline operations the connector runs when copying existing data. You can use this setting to filter the source collection and improve the use of indexes in the copying process. \nEXAMPLE The following example shows how you can use the $match aggregation operator to instruct the connector to copy only documents that contain a closed field with a value of false. startup.mode.copy.existing.pipeline=[ { \"$match\": { \"closed\": \"false\" } } ] \nDefault: \"\"\nAccepted Values: Valid aggregation pipeline stages\nstartup.mode.copy.existing.max.threads\nType: int \nDescription:\nThe maximum number of threads the connector can use to copy data.\nDefault: number of processors available in the environment\nAccepted Values: An integer\nstartup.mode.copy.existing.queue.size\nType: int \nDescription:\nThe size of the queue the connector can use when copying data.\nDefault: 16000\nAccepted Values: An integer\nstartup.mode.copy.existing.allow.disk.use\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nWhen set to true, the connector uses temporary disk storage for the

\nUse the following configuration settings to specify how the MongoDB Kafka source connector behaves when it encounters errors and to specify settings related to resuming interrupted reads. To view only the options related to handling errors, see the Error Handling and Resuming from Interruption Properties page. Name\nDescription\nmongo.errors.tolerance\nType: string \nDescription:\nWhether to continue processing messages when the connector encounters an error.\nSet this to \"none\" if you want the connector to stop processing messages and report the issue if it encounters an error.\nSet this to \"all\" if you want the connector to continue processing messages and ignore any errors it encounters. \nIMPORTANT This property overrides the errors.tolerance Connect Framework property.  Default: \"none\"\nAccepted Values: \"none\" or \"all\"\nmongo.errors.log.enable\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nWhether the connector should report errors in the log file.\nSet this to true to log all errors the connector encounters.\nSet this to false to log errors that are not tolerated by the connector. You can specify which errors the connector should tolerate using the errors.tolerance or mongo.errors.tolerance setting. \nIMPORTANT This property overrides the errors.log.enable Connect Framework property.  Default: false\nAccepted Values: true or false\nmongo.errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe name of topic to use as the dead letter queue.\nIf you specify a value, the connector writes invalid messages to the dead letter queue topic as extended JSON strings.\nIf you leave this setting blank, the connector does not write invalid messages to any topic. \nIMPORTANT You must set errors.tolerance or mongo.errors.tolerance setting to \"all\" to enable this property. Default: \"\"\nAccepted Values: A valid Kafka topic name\noffset.partition.name\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe custom offset partition name to use. You can use this option to instruct the connector to start a new change stream when an existing offset contains an invalid resume token. If you leave this setting blank, the connector uses the default partition name based on the connection details. To view a strategy for naming offset partitions, see the Reset Stored Offsets guide.\nDefault: \"\"\nAccepted Values: A string. To learn more about naming a partition, see SourceRecord in the Apache Kafka API documentation.\nheartbeat.interval.ms\nType: long \nDescription:\nThe number of milliseconds the connector waits between sending heartbeat messages. The connector sends heartbeat messages when source records are not published in the specified interval.\nHeartbeat messages contain a postBatchResumeToken data field. The value of this field contains the MongoDB server oplog entry that the connector last read from the change stream.\nThis mechanism improves resumability of the connector for low volume namespaces. See the Invalid Resume Token page for more information on this feature.\nSet this to 0 to disable heartbeat messages.\nDefault: 0\nAccepted Values: An integer\nheartbeat.topic.name\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe name of the topic on which the connector should publish heartbeat messages. You must provide a positive value in the heartbeat.interval.ms setting to enable this feature. \nDefault: __mongodb_heartbeats\nAccepted Values: A valid Kafka topic name ←  Error Handling and Resuming

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nTOPIC NAMING \nThe examples on this page show how to configure your MongoDB Kafka source connector to customize the name of the topic to which it publishes records. By default, the MongoDB Kafka source connector publishes change event data to a Kafka topic with the same name as the MongoDB namespace from which the change events originated. A namespace is a string that's composed of the database and collection name concatenated with a dot \".\" character. The following examples show different ways that you can customize the Kafka topics to which the connector publishes change event data:      * Topic Prefix  * Topic Suffix  * Topic Namespace Map  * Topic Namespace Map with Wildcard \nTOPIC PREFIX EXAMPLE \nYou can configure your source connector to prepend a string to the namespace of the change event data, and publish records to that Kafka topic. This setting automatically concatenates your prefix with your namespace with the \".\" character. To specify the topic prefix, use the topic.prefix configuration setting as shown in the following example: topic.prefix=myPrefixdatabase=testcollection=data  Once set, your connector publishes any changes to the data collection in the test database to the Kafka topic named myPrefix.test.data. \nTOPIC SUFFIX EXAMPLE \nYou can configure your source connector to append a string to the namespace of the change event data, and publish records to that Kafka topic. This setting automatically concatenates your namespace with your suffix with the \".\" character. To specify the topic suffix, use the topic.suffix configuration setting as shown in the following example: topic.suffix=mySuffixdatabase=testcollection=data  Once set, your connector publishes any changes to the data collection in the test database to the Kafka topic named test.data.mySuffix. \nTOPIC NAMESPACE MAP EXAMPLE \nYou can configure your source connector to map namespace values to Kafka topic names for incoming change event data. If the database name or namespace of the change event matches one of the fields in the map, the connector publishes the record to the value that corresponds to that mapping. If the database name or namespace of the change event do not match any mapping, the connector publishes the record using the default topic naming scheme unless otherwise specified by a different topic naming setting. Any mapping that includes both database and collection takes precedence over mappings that only specify the source database name. \nIMPORTANT The namespace map matching occurs before the connector applies any other topic naming setting. If defined, the connector applies the topic.prefix and the topic.suffix settings to the topic name after the mapping. The following example shows how to specify the topic.namespace.map setting to define a topic namespace mappings from the carDb database to the automobiles topic and the carDb.ev namespace to the electricVehicles topic: topic.namespace.map={\"carDb\": \"automobiles\", \"carDb.ev\": \"electricVehicles\"}  Since the carDb.ev namespace mapping takes precedence over the carDb mapping, the connector performs the following actions:  * If the change event came from the database carDb and collection ev, the connector sets the destination to the electricVehicles topic.  * If the change event came from the database carDb and a collection other than ev, the connector sets the destination to the automobiles.<collectionName> topic.  * If the change document came from any database other than carDb, the connector sets the destination topic to the default namespace naming scheme.  * If defined, the connector applies the topic.prefix and topic.suffix settings to the destination topic name after it performs namespace mapping. \nTOPIC NAMESPACE MAP WITH WILDCARD EXAMPLE \nIn addition to specifying database name and namespace in your topic namespace map as shown in Topic Namespace Map Example, you can use a wildcard * to match change events from all databases and namespaces without mappings. topic.namespace.map={\"carDb\": \"automobiles\", \"carDb.ev\": \"electricVehicles\", \"*\": \"otherVehicles\"}  In the preceding wildcard example, the connector publishes change documents that originated from all databases other than carDb to the otherVehicles topic. ←  Listen for

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nCUSTOMIZE A PIPELINE TO FILTER CHANGE EVENTS \nThis usage example demonstrates how to configure a pipeline to customize the data that your MongoDB Kafka source connector consumes. A pipeline is a MongoDB aggregation pipeline composed of instructions to the database to filter or transform data. MongoDB notifies the connector of data changes that match your aggregation pipeline on a change stream. A change stream is a sequence of events that describe data changes a client made to a MongoDB deployment in real-time. For more information, see the MongoDB Server manual entry on Change Streams. \nEXAMPLE \nSuppose you're an event coordinator who needs to collect names and arrival times of each guest at a specific event. Whenever a guest checks into the event, an application inserts a new document that contains the following details: {  \"_id\": ObjectId(...),  \"eventId\": 321,  \"name\": \"Dorothy Gale\",  \"arrivalTime\": 2021-10-31T20:30:00.245Z} You can define your connector pipeline setting to instruct the change stream to filter the change event information as follows:      * Create change events for insert operations and omit events for all other types of operations.  * Create change events only for documents that match the fullDocument.eventId value \"321\" and omit all other documents.  * Omit the _id and eventId fields from the fullDocument object using a projection. To apply these transformations, assign the following aggregation pipeline to your pipeline setting: pipeline=[{\"$match\": { \"$and\": [{\"operationType\": \"insert\"}, { \"fullDocument.eventId\": 321 }] } }, {\"$project\": { \"fullDocument._id\": 0, \"fullDocument.eventId\": 0 } } ]  \nIMPORTANT Make sure that the results of the pipeline contain the top-level _id field of the payload object, which MongoDB uses as the value of the resume token. When the application inserts the sample document, your configured connector publishes the following record to your Kafka topic: {  ...  \"payload\": {    _id: { _data: ... },    \"operationType\":

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nSTARTUP PROPERTIES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Settings \nOVERVIEW \nUse the following configuration settings to configure startup of the MongoDB Kafka source connector to convert MongoDB collections into Change Stream events. \nTIP For an example using the copy existing feature, see the Copy Existing Data Usage Example. For a list of source connector configuration settings organized by category, see the guide on Source Connector Configuration Properties. \nSETTINGS \nName\nDescription\nstartup.mode\nType: string \nDescription:\nSpecifies how the connector should start up when there is no source offset available. Resuming a change stream requires a resume token, which the connector gets from the source offset. If no source offset is available, the connector may either ignore all or some of the existing source data, or may at first copy all existing source data and then continue with processing new data. \nIf startup.mode=latest, the connector ignores all existing source data. \nIf startup.mode=timestamp, the connector actuates startup.mode.timestamp.* properties. If no properties are configured, timestamp is equivalent to latest. \nIf startup.mode=copy_existing, the connector copies all existing source data to Change Stream events. This setting is equivalent to the deprecated setting copy.existing=true. \nNOTE \nDATA COPY CAN PRODUCE DUPLICATE EVENTS If any system changes the data in the database while the source connector converts existing data from it, MongoDB may produce duplicate change stream events to reflect the latest changes. Since the change stream events on which the data copy relies are idempotent, the copied data is eventually consistent. Default:latest\nAccepted Values: latest, timestamp, copy_existing\nstartup.mode.timestamp.start.at.operation.time\nType: string \nDescription:\nActuated only if startup.mode=timestamp. Specifies the starting point for the change stream.

A namespace describes the MongoDB database name and collection separated by a period (for example, databaseName.collectionName). \nEXAMPLE In the following example, the regular-expression setting matches collections that start with \"page\" in the stats database. startup.mode.copy.existing.namespace.regex=stats\\.page.*  The \"\" character in the example above escapes the \".\" character that follows it in the regular expression. For more information on how to build regular expressions, see the Java API documentation on Patterns. Default: \"\"\nAccepted Values: A valid regular expression\nstartup.mode.copy.existing.pipeline\nType: string \nDescription:\nAn inline array of pipeline operations the connector runs when copying existing data. You can use this setting to filter the source collection and improve the use of indexes in the copying process. \nEXAMPLE The following example shows how you can use the $match aggregation operator to instruct the connector to copy only documents that contain a closed field with a value of false. startup.mode.copy.existing.pipeline=[ { \"$match\": { \"closed\": \"false\" } } ] \nDefault: \"\"\nAccepted Values: Valid aggregation pipeline stages\nstartup.mode.copy.existing.max.threads\nType: int \nDescription:\nThe maximum number of threads the connector can use to copy data.\nDefault: number of processors available in the environment\nAccepted Values: An integer\nstartup.mode.copy.existing.queue.size\nType: int \nDescription:\nThe size of the queue the connector can use when copying data.\nDefault: 16000\nAccepted Values: An integer\nstartup.mode.copy.existing.allow.disk.use\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nWhen set to true, the connector uses temporary disk storage for the

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nCHANGE STREAM PROPERTIES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Settings \nOVERVIEW \nUse the following configuration settings to specify aggregation pipelines for change streams and read preferences for change stream cursors when working with the MongoDB Kafka source connector. For a list of source connector configuration settings organized by category, see the guide on Source Connector Configuration Properties. \nSETTINGS \nName\nDescription\npipeline\nType: string \nDescription:\nAn array of aggregation pipelines to run in your change stream. You must configure this setting for the change stream event document, not the fullDocument field. \nEXAMPLE [{\"$match\": { \"$and\": [{\"operationType\": \"insert\"}, {\"fullDocument.eventId\": 1404 }] } }]  \nTIP \nADDITIONAL EXAMPLES      * Customize a Pipeline to Filter Change Events  * Listen for Changes on Multiple Sources Default: []\nAccepted Values: Valid aggregation pipeline stage\nchange.stream.full.document\nType: string \nDescription:\nDetermines what values your change stream returns on update operations.\nThe default setting returns the differences between the original document and the updated document.\nThe updateLookup setting returns the differences between the original document and updated document as well as a copy of the entire updated document at a point in time after the update.\nThe whenAvailable setting returns the updated document, if available.\nThe required setting returns the updated document and raises an error if it is not available. \nTIP For more information on how this change stream option works, see the MongoDB server manual guide on Lookup Full Document for Update Operations.  Default: \"\"\nAccepted Values: \"\", \"updateLookup\", \"whenAvailable\", or \"required\"\nchange.stream.full.document.before.change\nType: string \nDescription:\nConfigures the document pre-image your change stream returns on update operations. The pre-image is not available for source records published while copying existing data, and the pre-image configuration has no effect on copying. \nTIP To learn how to configure a collection to enable pre-images, see the Server manual entry on pre- and post-images.

how to observe the behavior of your MongoDB Kafka source connector or MongoDB Kafka sink connector through monitoring. Monitoring is the process of getting information about the activities a running program performs for use in an application or an application performance management library. To learn how monitoring works in the connector and how to use it, see the Use Cases section. To view an example that shows how to monitor a running connector, see the Example - Monitor the Quick Start section. To view a list of all metrics produced by MongoDB source and sink connectors, see the Available Metrics section. \nUSE CASES \nThis section describes use cases for monitoring MongoDB source and sink connectors, and how you can use the metrics your connector provides to satisfy those use cases. \nTIP \nCOMPUTED VALUES To learn what types of metrics the connector provides and when you must implement logic to compute a value, see Types of Metrics. \nSINK CONNECTOR \nThe following table describes some use cases for monitoring the MongoDB sink connector and the metrics the sink connector provides to satisfy those use cases: Use Case\nMetrics to Use\nYou need to know if a component of your pipeline is falling behind.\nUse the latest-kafka-time-difference-ms metric. This metric indicates the interval of time between when a record arrived in a Kafka topic and when your connector received that record. If the value of this metric is increasing, it signals that there may be a problem with Apache Kafka or MongoDB.\nYou need to know the total number of records your connector wrote to MongoDB.\nUse the records metric.\nYou need to know the total number of write errors your connector encountered when attempting to write to MongoDB.\nUse the batch-writes-failed metric.\nYou need to know if your MongoDB performance is getting slower over time. Use the in-task-put-duration-ms metric to initally diagnose a slowdown. Use the following metrics to further diagnose any issues:      * batch-writes-successful-duration-over-<number>-ms  * batch-writes-failed-duration-over-<number>-ms  * processing-phase-duration-over-<number>-ms You need to find a bottleneck in how Kafka Connect and your MongoDB sink connector write Apache Kafka records to MongoDB. Compare the values of the following metrics:  * in-task-put-duration-ms  * in-connect-framework-duration-ms You can find descriptions of all MongoDB sink connector metrics in the Sink Connector JMX Metrics section. \nSOURCE CONNECTOR \nThe following table describes some use cases for monitoring the MongoDB source connector and the metrics the source connector provides to satisfy those use cases: Use Case\nMetrics to Use\nYou need to know if a component of your pipeline is falling behind.\nUse the latest-mongodb-time-difference-secs metric. This metric indicates how old the most recent change stream event your connector processed is. If this metric is increasing, it signals that there may be a problem with Apache Kafka or MongoDB.\nYou need to know the total number of change stream events your source connector has processed.\nUse the records metric.\nYou need to know the percentage of records your connector received but failed to write to Apache Kafka. Perform the following calculation with the records, records-filtered, and records-acknowledged metrics: (records - (records-acknowledged + records-filtered)) / records \nYou need to know the average size of the documents your connector has processed. Perform the following calculation with the mongodb-bytes-read and records metrics: mongodb-bytes-read / records  To learn how to calculate the average size of records over a span of time, see mongodb-bytes-read. You need to find a bottleneck in how Kafka Connect and your MongoDB source connector write MongoDB documents to Apache Kafka.

You need to know if your MongoDB performance is getting slower over time. Use the in-task-poll-duration-ms metric to initially diagnose a slowdown. Use the following metrics to further diagnose any issues:  * initial-commands-successful-duration-over-<number>-ms  * initial-commands-failed-duration-over-<number>-ms  * getmore-commands-successful-duration-over-<number>-ms  * getmore-commands-failed-duration-over-<number>-ms You can find descriptions of all MongoDB source connector metrics in the Source Connector JMX Metrics section. \nMONITOR THE CONNECTOR \nThe MongoDB Kafka Connector uses Java Management Extensions (JMX) to enable monitoring. JMX is a technology included in the Java Platform, Standard Edition that provides tools to monitor applications and devices. You can view the metrics produced by the connector with any JMX console, such as JConsole. The MongoDB Kafka Connector provides metrics for individual tasks. Tasks are classes instantiated by Kafka Connect that copy data to and from datastores and Apache Kafka. The names and responsibilities of the two types of tasks in Kafka Connect are as follows:  * A source task copies data from a data store to Apache Kafka.  * A sink task copies data from Apache Kafka to a data store. A sink connector configures one or more sink tasks. A source connector configures one or more source tasks. To learn more about JMX, see the following resources from Oracle:  * Java Management Extensions Guide  * Using JConsole To learn more about tasks and connectors in Kafka Connect, see the following resources:  * Kafka Connect Concepts from Confluent  * Kafka Connect API documentation for the Task interface  * Kafka Connect API documentation for the Connector abstract class \nENABLE MONITORING \nThe MongoDB Kafka Connector uses Kafka Connect's metrics infrastructure to serve metrics. To read the metrics produced by your connector, enable JMX in your Kafka Connect deployment. To learn how to enable JMX for a Kafka Connect instance running on your host machine, see the Official Kafka Documentation. To learn how to enable JMX for a containerized Kafka Connect deployment, see Kafka Monitoring and Metrics Using JMX with Docker. \nTYPES OF METRICS \nThe connector provides metrics related to the following types of quantities:  * The number of times an event has occurred in total for a connector task  * The value related to the most recent occurrence of an event For some use cases, you must perform extra computations with the metrics the connector provides. For example, you must compute the following values from provided metrics:  * The rate of change of a metric  * The value of a metric over a span of time  * The difference between one metric and another metric To view some examples of computed metrics, see the Use Cases section. \nJMX PATHS \nThe MongoDB Kafka Connector and Kafka Connect both produce metrics for MongoDB connector tasks. Both sets of metrics provide information about how your tasks interact with Kafka Connect, but only the MongoDB Kafka Connector metrics provide information about how your tasks interact with MongoDB. The MongoDB Kafka Connector produces metrics under the following JMX paths:  * com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink-task-metrics.sink-task-<monitonically increasing number>  * com.mongodb.kafka.connect.source-task-metrics.source-task-<monitonically increasing number>  * com.mongodb.kafka.connect.source-task-metrics.source-task-change-stream-<monitonically increasing number>  * com.mongodb.kafka.connect.source-task-metrics.source-task-copy-existing-<monitonically increasing number> Kafka Connect produces metrics under the following JMX paths:  * kafka.connect.sink-task-metrics.<connector-name>  * kafka.connect.source-task-metrics.<connector-name>  * kafka.connect.connector-task-metrics.<connector-name> To relate Kafka Connect metrics to MongoDB Kafka Connector metrics, you must remember the order in which you added your connectors to Kafka Connect. \nNOTE \nNAMING CONFLICTS If the MongoDB Kafka Connector ever encounters a naming

EXAMPLE \nAssume you add a single MongoDB source connector named my-source-connector to your deployment. The MongoDB source connector writes metrics to the following JMX path:  * com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink-task-metrics.sink-task-0 Kafka Connect writes metrics for this task under the following path:  * kafka.connect.sink-task-metrics.my-source-connector \nEXAMPLE - MONITOR THE QUICK START \nThe sample environment provided in the Quick Start exposes metrics on your host machine at the URI localhost:35000. To view these metrics with JConsole, perform the following actions: 1 \nDOWNLOAD JCONSOLE. \nJConsole is part of the Java Platform, Standard Edition. To download JConsole, download the Java SE Development Kit from Oracle. 2 \nSTART THE QUICK START PIPELINE AND ADD CONNECTORS. \nFollow the Quick Start until the Send the Contents of a Document through Your Connectors step. 3 \nSTART JCONSOLE. \nRun the following command from your command line to start JConsole: jconsole \n4 \nCONNECT TO THE KAFKA CONNECT JMX SERVER. \n1 ENTER YOUR JMX SERVER URI. \nEnter the URI localhost:35000 into the Remote Process text input box in the JConsole interface. 2 CLICK CONNECT. \n3 IN THE DIALOG BOX, CLICK INSECURE CONNECTION. \n5 \nEXPLORE YOUR CONNECTORS' METRICS. \n1 NAVIGATE TO THE MBEANS TAB IN JCONSOLE. \n2 INSPECT CONNECTOR METRICS. \nNotice that the com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink-task-metrics.sink-task-0.records attribute has a value of 0. This value indicates that your sink task has not recieved any records from Apache Kafka. 3 CONTINUE THE QUICK START. \nContinue the Quick Start until, but not through, the Remove the Sandbox step. 4 RETURN TO JCONSOLE. \nNavigate back to the MBeans tab in JConsole. The com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink-task-metrics.sink-task-0.records attribute should now have a value of 1. 6 \nSTOP AND REMOVE THE QUICK START ENVIRONMENT. \nTo stop and remove the Quick Start environment, follow the Remove the Sandbox step of the Quick Start. \nAVAILABLE METRICS \nUse the attributes in the tables in this section to monitor the behavior of your source and sink connectors through Java Management Extensions (JMX). \nTIP \nJMX ATTRIBUTES JMX represents an individual metric as an attribute of an MBean.

\nSOURCE CONNECTOR JMX METRICS  NOTE \nINITIAL COMMANDS AND GETMORE COMMANDS Some metrics for source connector tasks distinguish between initial commands and getMore commands. An initial command is a find or aggregate command sent to a MongoDB instance that retrieves the first set of documents in a client-side MongoDB cursor. The getMore command is the MongoDB command that fetches the subsequent sets of documents in a cursor. To learn more about getMore commands, see the getMore page. Attribute Name\nDescription\nrecords\nThe total number of records a MongoDB source task passed to the Kafka Connect framework.\nrecords-filtered\nThe number of records a MongoDB source task passed to the Kafka Connect framework that were then filtered by the framework. A filtered record is not written to Kafka.\nrecords-acknowledged\nThe total number of records a MongoDB source task passed to the Kafka Connect framework that were then successfully written to Kafka.\nmongodb-bytes-read The total number of bytes a MongoDB source task read from the MongoDB server. \nTIP \nAVERAGE RECORD SIZE OVER A SPAN OF TIME To calculate the average size of the records your sink connector processed over a span of time, perform the following actions:  1. Determine the change in the value of the mongodb-bytes-read attribute for a span of time.  2.

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nKAFKA TOPIC PROPERTIES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Settings \nOVERVIEW \nUse the following configuration settings to specify which Kafka topics the MongoDB Kafka source connector should publish data to. For a list of source connector configuration settings organized by category, see the guide on Source Connector Configuration Properties. \nSETTINGS \nName\nDescription\ntopic.prefix\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe prefix to prepend to database and collection names to generate the name of the Kafka topic on which to publish the data. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: Topic Naming Prefix Usage Example Default: \"\"\nAccepted Values: A string composed of ASCII alphanumeric characters including \".\", \"-\", and \"_\"\ntopic.suffix\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe suffix to append to database and collection names to generate the name of the Kafka topic on which to publish the data. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: Topic Naming Suffix Usage Example Default: \"\"\nAccepted Values: A string composed of ASCII alphanumeric characters including \".\", \"-\", and \"_\"\ntopic.namespace.map\nType: string \nDescription:\nSpecifies a JSON mapping between change stream document namespaces and topic names. \nEXAMPLE The following mapping instructs the connector to perform the following actions:      * Publish change stream documents originating from the myDb.myColl MongoDB collection to the topicOne Kafka topic.  * Publish change stream documents originating from the myDb MongoDB database and a collection other than myColl to the Kafka topic topicTwo.<collectionName>.  * Publish change stream documents originating from the myDb MongoDB database that do not bear a collection name to the topicTwo Kafka topic. topic.namespace.map={\"myDb.myColl\": \"topicOne\", \"myDb\": \"topicTwo\"} The following examples show which topic the connector sends different change stream documents to using the preceding mapping:  * A change stream document originating from the myDb database and the myColl collection publishes to the topicOne topic.  * A change stream document originating from the myDb database and the newColl collection publishes to the topicTwo.newColl topic.  * A change stream document originating from dropping the myDb database, which does not bear a collection name, publishes to the topicTwo topic. You can use the \"*\" wildcard character to match change stream document namespaces. \nEXAMPLE The following mapping instructs the connector to publish all change stream documents to the topicThree topic: topic.namespace.map={\"*\": \"topicThree\"} Default: \"\"\nAccepted Values: A valid JSON object\ntopic.separator\nType: string \nDescription:\nSpecifies the string the connector uses to concatenate the values used to create the name of your topic. The connector publishes records to a topic with a name formed by concatenating the values of the following fields in the following order:  1. topic.prefix  2. database  3. collection  4. topic.suffix \nEXAMPLE The following configuration instructs the connector to publish change stream documents from the coll collection of the db database to the prefix-db-coll topic:    topic.prefix=prefix   database=db   collection=coll   topic.separator=- \nIMPORTANT \nTOPIC SEPARATOR AND TOPIC NAMESPACE MAP When you use the topic.separator property, keep in mind that it does not affect how you define the topic.namespace.map property. The topic.namespace.map property uses MongoDB namespaces which you must always specify with a \".\" character to separate the database and collection name.  Default: \".\"\nAccepted Values: A string\ntopic.mapper\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe Java class that defines your custom topic mapping logic. \nDefault: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.source.topic.mapping.DefaultTopicMapper\nAccepted Values: Valid full class name of an implementation of the TopicMapper class. ←  MongoDB Source Connection PropertiesChange

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nCOPY EXISTING PROPERTIES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Settings \nOVERVIEW  IMPORTANT \nCOPY.EXISTING* PROPERTIES ARE DEPRECATED Starting in Version 1.9 of the MongoDB Kafka Connector, copy.existing* properties are deprecated and may be removed in a future release. You should use startup.mode* properties to configure the copy existing feature. To learn about startup.mode* settings, see Startup Properties. Use the following configuration settings to enable the copy existing feature which converts MongoDB collections into Change Stream events. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: For an example of the copy existing feature, see the Copy Existing Data Usage Example. For a list of source connector configuration settings organized by category, see the guide on Source Connector Configuration Properties. \nSETTINGS \nName\nDescription\ncopy.existing\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nWhether to enable the copy existing feature which converts all data in a MongoDB collection to Change Stream events and publishes them on Kafka topics. If MongoDB changes the source collection data after the connector starts the copy process, the connector creates events for the changes after it completes the copy process. \nNOTE \nDATA COPY CAN PRODUCE DUPLICATE EVENTS If any system changes the data in the database while the source connector converts existing data from it, MongoDB may produce duplicate change stream events to reflect the latest changes. Since the change stream events on which the data copy relies are idempotent, the copied data is eventually consistent. Default:false\nAccepted Values: true or false\ncopy.existing.namespace.regex\nType: string \nDescription:\nRegular expression the connector uses to match namespaces from which to copy data. A namespace describes the MongoDB database name and collection separated by a period (for example, databaseName.collectionName). \nEXAMPLE In the following example, the regular-expression setting matches collections that start with \"page\" in the stats database. copy.existing.namespace.regex=stats\\.page.*  The \"\" character in the example above escapes the \".\" character that follows it in the regular expression. For more information on how to build regular expressions, see the Java API documentation on Patterns. Default: \"\"\nAccepted Values: A valid regular expression\ncopy.existing.pipeline\nType: string \nDescription:\nAn array of pipeline operations the connector runs when copying existing data. You can use this setting to filter the source collection and improve the use of indexes in the copying process. \nEXAMPLE The following example shows how you can use the $match aggregation operator to instruct the connector to copy only documents that contain a closed field with a value of false. copy.existing.pipeline=[ { \"$match\": { \"closed\": \"false\" } } ] \nDefault: []\nAccepted Values: Valid aggregation pipeline stages\ncopy.existing.max.threads\nType: int \nDescription:\nThe maximum number of threads the connector can use to copy data.\nDefault: number of processors available in the environment\nAccepted Values: An integer\ncopy.existing.queue.size\nType: int \nDescription:\nThe size of the queue the connector can use when copying data.\nDefault: 16000\nAccepted Values: An

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nERROR HANDLING AND RESUMING FROM INTERRUPTION PROPERTIES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Settings\n * Heartbeats with Single Message Transforms \nOVERVIEW \nUse the following configuration settings to specify how the MongoDB Kafka source connector behaves when it encounters errors and to specify settings related to resuming interrupted reads. \nSETTINGS \nName\nDescription\nmongo.errors.tolerance\nType: string \nDescription:\nWhether to continue processing messages when the connector encounters an error.\nSet this to \"none\" if you want the connector to stop processing messages and report the issue if it encounters an error.\nSet this to \"all\" if you want the connector to continue processing messages and ignore any errors it encounters. \nIMPORTANT This property overrides the errors.tolerance Connect Framework property.  Default: \"none\"\nAccepted Values: \"none\" or \"all\"\nmongo.errors.log.enable\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nWhether the connector should report errors in the log file.\nSet this to true to log all errors the connector encounters.\nSet this to false to log errors that are not tolerated by the connector. You can specify which errors the connector should tolerate using the errors.tolerance or mongo.errors.tolerance setting. \nIMPORTANT This property overrides the errors.log.enable Connect Framework property.  Default: false\nAccepted Values: true or false\nmongo.errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe name of topic to use as the dead letter queue.\nIf you specify a value, the connector writes invalid messages to the dead letter queue topic as extended JSON strings.\nIf you leave this setting blank, the connector does not write invalid messages to any topic. \nIMPORTANT You must set errors.tolerance or mongo.errors.tolerance setting to \"all\" to enable this property. Default: \"\"\nAccepted Values: A valid Kafka topic name\noffset.partition.name\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe custom offset partition name to use. You can use this option to instruct the connector to start a new change stream when an existing offset contains an invalid resume token. If you leave this setting blank, the connector uses the default partition name based on the connection details. To view a strategy for naming offset partitions, see the Reset Stored Offsets guide.\nDefault: \"\"\nAccepted Values: A string. To learn more about naming a partition, see SourceRecord in the Apache Kafka API documentation.\nheartbeat.interval.ms\nType: long \nDescription:\nThe number of milliseconds the connector waits between sending heartbeat messages. The connector sends heartbeat messages when source records are not published in the specified interval.\nHeartbeat messages contain a postBatchResumeToken data field. The value of this field contains the MongoDB server oplog entry that the connector last read from the change stream.\nThis mechanism improves resumability of the connector for low volume namespaces. See the Invalid Resume Token page for more information on this feature.\nSet this to 0 to disable heartbeat messages.\nDefault: 0\nAccepted Values: An integer\nheartbeat.topic.name\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe name of the topic on which the connector should publish heartbeat messages. You must provide a positive value in the heartbeat.interval.ms setting to enable this feature. \nDefault: __mongodb_heartbeats\nAccepted Values: A valid Kafka topic name \nHEARTBEATS WITH SINGLE MESSAGE TRANSFORMS \nIf you enable heartbeats and specify Single Message Transforms (SMTs) in your Kafka Connect deployment, you must exclude your heartbeat messages from your SMTs. SMTs are a feature of Kafka Connect that enables you to specify transformations on the messages that pass through your source connector without having to deploy a stream processing application. To exclude heartbeat messages from your SMTs, you must create and apply a predicate to your SMTs. Predicates are a feature of SMTs that enables you to check if a message matches a conditional statement before applying a transformation. The following configuration defines the IsHeartbeat predicate which matches heartbeat messages sent to the default heartbeat topic: predicates=IsHeartbeatpredicates.IsHeartbeat.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.predicates.TopicNameMatchespredicates.IsHeartbeat.pattern=__mongodb_heartbeats  The following configuration uses

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nCHANGE STREAMS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Change Streams\n * Aggregation\n * Change Event Structure\n * Performance\n * Source Connectors\n * Resume Tokens \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn about change streams and how they are used in a MongoDB Kafka source connector. \nCHANGE STREAMS \nChange streams are a MongoDB feature that allow you to receive real-time updates on data changes. Change streams return change event documents. A change event document contains idempotent instructions to describe a change that occurred in your MongoDB deployment and metadata related to that change. Change event documents are generated from data in the oplog. \nIMPORTANT \nCHANGE STREAMS ONLY RUN ON MONGODB REPLICA SETS AND SHARDED CLUSTERS A standalone MongoDB instance cannot produce a change stream. To view a list of all configuration options for change streams, see the Change Stream Properties page. To learn more about change streams, see the following resources:      * Change Streams in the MongoDB manual  * An Introduction to Change Streams blog post To learn more about the oplog, see the MongoDB manual entry on the Replica Set Oplog. \nAGGREGATION \nUse an aggregation pipeline to configure your source connector's change stream. Some of the ways you can configure your connector's change stream are as follows:  * Filter change events by operation type  * Project specific fields  * Update the value of fields  * Add fields  * Trim the amount of data generated by the change stream To learn which aggregation operators you can use with a change stream, see the Modify Change Stream Output guide in the MongoDB manual. To view examples that use an aggregation pipeline to modify a change stream, see the following pages:  * Customize a Pipeline to Filter Change Events Usage Example  * Copy Existing Data Usage Example \nCHANGE EVENT STRUCTURE \nFind the complete structure of change event documents, including descriptions of all fields, in the MongoDB manual. \nNOTE \nTHE FULL DOCUMENT OPTION If you want Kafka Connect to receive just the document created or modified from your change operation, use the publish.full.document.only=true option. For more information, see the Change Stream Properties page. \nPERFORMANCE \nThe oplog is a special capped collection which cannot use indexes. For more information on this limitation, see Change Streams Production Recommendations. If you need to improve change stream performance, use a faster disk for your MongoDB cluster and increase the size of your WiredTiger cache. To learn how to set your WiredTiger cache, see the guide on the WiredTiger Storage Engine. \nSOURCE CONNECTORS \nThe source connector works by opening a single change stream with MongoDB and sending data from that change stream to Kafka Connect. Your source connector maintains its change stream for the duration of its runtime, and your connector closes its change stream when you stop it. To view the available options to configure your source connector's change stream, see the Change Stream Properties page. \nRESUME TOKENS \nYour connector uses a resume token as its offset. An offset is a value your connector stores in an Apache Kafka topic to keep track of what source data it has processed. Your connector uses its offset value when it must recover from a restart or crash. A resume token is a piece of data that references the _id field of a change event document in your MongoDB oplog. If your source connector does not have an offset, such as when you start the connector for the first time, your connector starts a new change stream. Once your connector receives its first change event document and publishes that document to Apache Kafka, your connector stores the resume token of that document as its offset. If the resume token value of your source connector's offset does not correspond to any entry in your MongoDB deployment's oplog, your connector has an invalid resume token. To learn how to recover from an invalid resume token, see the invalid token troubleshooting guide.

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nAPPLY SCHEMAS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Default Schemas\n * Key Schema\n * Value Schema\n * Schemas For Transformed Documents\n * Specify Schemas\n * Infer a Schema \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to apply schemas to incoming documents in a MongoDB Kafka source connector. There are two types of schema in Kafka Connect, key schema and value schema. Kafka Connect sends messages to Apache Kafka containing both your value and a key. A key schema enforces a structure for keys in messages sent to Apache Kafka. A value schema enforces a structure for values in messages sent to Apache Kafka. \nIMPORTANT \nNOTE ON TERMINOLOGY The word \"key\" has a slightly different meaning in the context of BSON and Apache Kafka. In BSON, a \"key\" is a unique string identifier for a field in a document. In Apache Kafka, a \"key\" is a byte array sent in a message used to determine what partition of a topic to write the message to. Kafka keys can be duplicates of other keys or null. Specifying schemas in the connector is optional, and you can specify any of the following combinations of schemas:      * Only a value schema  * Only a key schema  * Both a value and key schema  * No schemas \nTIP \nBENEFITS OF SCHEMA To see a discussion on the benefits of using schemas with Kafka Connect, see this article from Confluent. If you want to send data through Apache Kafka with a specific data format, such as Apache Avro or JSON Schema, see the Converters guide. To learn more about keys and values in Apache Kafka, see the official Apache Kafka introduction. \nDEFAULT SCHEMAS \nThe connector provides two default schemas:  * A key schema for the _id field of MongoDB change event documents.  * A value schema for MongoDB change event documents. To learn more about change events, see our guide on change streams. To learn more about default schemas, see the default schemas here in the MongoDB Kafka Connector source code. \nKEY SCHEMA \nThe connector provides a default key schema for the _id field of change event documents. You should use the default key schema unless you remove the _id field from your change event document using either of the transformations described in this guide here. If you specify either of these transformations and want to use a key schema for your incoming documents, you must specify a key schema as described in the specify a schema section of this guide. You can enable the default key schema with the following option: output.format.key=schema  \nVALUE SCHEMA \nThe connector provides a default value schema for change event documents. You should use the default value schema unless you transform your change event documents as described in this guide here. If you specify either of these transformations and want to use a value schema for your incoming documents, you must use one of the mechanisms described in the schemas for transformed documents section of this guide. You can enable the default value schema with the following option: output.format.value=schema  \nSCHEMAS FOR TRANSFORMED DOCUMENTS \nThere are two ways you can transform your change event documents in a source connector:  * The publish.full.document.only=true option  * An aggregation pipeline that modifies the structure of change event documents If you transform your MongoDB change event documents, you must do the following to apply schemas:  * Specify schemas  * Have the connector infer a value schema To learn more about the preceding configuration options, see the Change Stream Properties page. \nSPECIFY SCHEMAS \nYou can specify schemas for incoming documents using Avro schema syntax. Click on the following tabs to see how to specify a schema for document values and keys:  \nTo view an example that demonstrates how to specify a schema, see the Specify a Schema usage example. To learn more about Avro Schema, see the Data Formats guide. \nIMPORTANT \nCONVERTERS If you want to send your data through Apache Kafka with Avro binary encoding, you must use an Avro converter. For more information, see the guide on Converters. \nINFER A SCHEMA \nYou can have your source connector infer a schema for incoming documents. This option works well for development and for data sources that do not frequently change structure, but for most production deployments we recommend that you specify a schema.

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nMONGODB AWS-BASED AUTHENTICATION \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Connector Connection Settings \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to authenticate your MongoDB Kafka Connector with your MongoDB replica set using the MONGODB-AWS authentication mechanism. The MONGODB-AWS authentication mechanism uses your Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) credentials to authenticate your user. To learn how to set up your MongoDB replica set in MongoDB Atlas to use AWS IAM credentials, see the guide on How to Set Up Unified AWS Access. \nIMPORTANT You need to use MongoDB Kafka Connector version 1.5 of later to connect to a MongoDB server set up to authenticate using your AWS IAM credentials. AWS IAM credential authentication is available in MongoDB server version 4.4 and later. \nCONNECTOR CONNECTION SETTINGS \nYou can specify your MONGODB-AWS authentication credentials in your connection URI connector property as shown in the following example: connection.uri=mongodb://<AWS access key id>:<AWS secret access key>@<hostname>:<port>/?authSource=<authentication database>&authMechanism=MONGODB-AWS&authMechanismProperties=AWS_SESSION_TOKEN:<AWS session token>  The preceding example uses the following placeholders which you need to replace: Placeholder\nDescription\nAWS access key id\nValue of your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID.\nAWS secret access key\nValue of your AWS_SECRET_KEY.\nhostname\nNetwork address of your MongoDB server.\nport\nPort number of your MongoDB server.\nauthentication database\nMongoDB database that contains your user's authentication data. If you omit the authSource parameter and placeholder value, the driver uses the default value admin.\nAWS session token\nValue of your AWS_SESSION_TOKEN.

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nSSL/TLS AND X.509 CERTIFICATES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Prerequisites\n * Store Certificates on the Worker\n * Keystore\n * Truststore\n * Add Credentials to the Connector \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to secure communications between your MongoDB Kafka Connector worker and your MongoDB cluster. To secure your connection, you must perform the following tasks:      * Create the certificates  * Store the certificates on the worker host machine  * Supply the certificates' credentials to the connector \nNOTE If you host your MongoDB cluster on MongoDB Atlas or your cluster does not explicitly require certificates, you can already communicate securely and do not need to follow the steps in this guide. \nPREREQUISITES \nThis guide requires prior knowledge of the following concepts:  * Transport Layer Security  * X.509  * Certificate Authorities (CA)  * PKCS 12  * OpenSSL  * keytool \nSTORE CERTIFICATES ON THE WORKER \nStore your certificates in a keystore and truststore to secure your certificate credentials for each server you run your connector worker instance on. \nKEYSTORE \nYou can use a keystore to store private keys and identity certificates. The keystore uses the key and certificate to verify the client's identity to external hosts. If your SSL/TLS configuration requires a client certificate to connect to your worker instance, generate a secure private key and include the client certificate bundled with the intermediate CA. Then, store this information in your keystore by using the following openssl command to generate a PKCS 12 file: openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey <your private key> \\               -in <your bundled certificate> \\               -out <your output pkcs12 file>  \nTRUSTSTORE \nYou can use a truststore to store certificates from a CA. The truststore uses the certificates to identify parties the client trusts. Some examples of these certificates are a root CA, intermediate CA and your MongoDB cluster's end entity certificate. Import the certificates of parties that you trust into your truststore by using the following keytool command: keytool -import -trustcacerts -import -file <your root or intermediate CA>  If your SSL/TLS configuration requires the end entity certificate for your MongoDB cluster, import it into your truststore with the following command: keytool -import -file <your server bundled certificate> -keystore <your keystore name>  For more information on how to set up a client keystore and truststore for testing purposes, see OpenSSL Client Certificates for Testing. \nADD CREDENTIALS TO THE CONNECTOR \nThe connector worker processes JVM options from your KAFKA_OPTS environment variable. The environment variable contains the path and password to your keystore and truststore. Export the following JVM options in your KAFKA_OPTS variable: export KAFKA_OPTS=\"\\-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<your path to truststore> \\-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<your truststore password> \\-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<your path to keystore> \\-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<your keystore password>\"  When the worker processes the JVM options, the connector attempts to connect by using the SSL/TLS protocol and certificates in your keystore and truststore. ←  Security and AuthenticationMongoDB AWS-based Authentication → On this page  * Overview\n * Prerequisites\n * Store

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nCONNECT TO MONGODB \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * How to Connect\n * How to Configure Your Connection\n * Authentication \nOVERVIEW \nLearn how to connect the MongoDB Kafka Connector to MongoDB using a connection Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). A connection URI is a string that contains the following information:      * The address of your MongoDB deployment required  * Connection settings optional  * Authentication settings optional  * Authentication credentials optional The following is an example of a connection URI for a MongoDB replica set: mongodb://mongodb0.example.com:27017,mongodb1.example.com:27017,mongodb2.example.com:27017/?replicaSet=myRepl  To learn more about the connection URI format, see Connection String URI Format in the MongoDB Manual. \nHOW TO CONNECT \nSpecify a connection URI with the following configuration option in both a source and sink connector: connection.uri=<your connection uri>  To learn more about this configuration option, see the following resources:  * Source connector configuration options  * Sink connector configuration options \nHOW TO CONFIGURE YOUR CONNECTION \nThe MongoDB Kafka Connector uses the MongoDB Java driver to parse your connection URI. The MongoDB Java driver is an artifact that enables Java applications like Kafka Connect to interact with MongoDB. \nIMPORTANT \nDRIVER VERSION Version 1.9 of the MongoDB Kafka Connector uses version 4.7 of the MongoDB Java driver. To learn what connection URI options are available in the connector, see the MongoDB Java driver Connection guide. \nAUTHENTICATION \nAll authentication mechanisms available in the MongoDB Java driver are available in the MongoDB Kafka Connector. The following is an example of a connection URI that authenticates with MongoDB using SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication: mongodb://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/?authSource=<authenticationDb>&authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256  \nIMPORTANT \nLOAD SECRETS To avoid storing your authentication secrets as plain text in your connection.uri setting, load your secrets from a secure location as your connector starts. To learn how to load your secrets as your connector starts, see the Externalize Secrets guide from Confluent. To learn what authentication mechanisms are available, see the MongoDB Java driver Authentication Mechanisms guide.

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nINVALID RESUME TOKEN \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Stack Trace\n * Cause\n * Solutions\n * Temporarily Tolerate Errors\n * Reset Stored Offsets\n * Prevention \nOVERVIEW \nLearn how to recover from an invalid resume token in a MongoDB Kafka source connector. \nSTACK TRACE \nThe following stack trace indicates that the source connector has an invalid resume token: ...org.apache.kafka.connect.errors.ConnectException: ResumeToken not found.Cannot create a change stream cursor...Command failed with error 286 (ChangeStreamHistoryLost): 'PlanExecutorerror during aggregation :: caused by :: Resume of change stream was notpossible, as the resume point may no longer be in the oplog...  \nCAUSE \nWhen the ID of your source connector's resume token does not correspond to any entry in your MongoDB deployment's oplog, your connector has no way to determine where to begin to process your MongoDB change stream. Click the following tabs to see scenarios in which you can experience this issue:  \nFor more information on the oplog, see the MongoDB Manual. For more information on change streams, see the Change Streams guide. \nSOLUTIONS \nYou can recover from an invalid resume token using one of the following strategies:      * Temporarily Tolerate Errors  * Reset Stored Offsets \nTEMPORARILY TOLERATE ERRORS \nYou can configure your source connector to tolerate errors while you produce a change stream event that updates the connector's resume token. This recovery strategy is the simplest, but there is a risk that your connector briefly ignores errors unrelated to the invalid resume token. If you aren't comfortable briefly tolerating errors in your deployment, you can delete stored offsets instead. To configure your source connector to temporarily tolerate errors:  1. Set the errors.tolerance option to tolerate all errors:\n    \n    errors.tolerance=all\n    \n      2. Insert, update, or delete a document in the collection referenced by your source connector to produce a change stream event that updates your connector's resume token.  3. Once you produce a change stream event, set the errors.tolerance option to no longer tolerate errors:\n    \n    errors.tolerance=none\n    \n     For more information on the errors.tolerance option, see the Error Handling and Resuming from Interruption Properties page. \nRESET STORED OFFSETS \nYou can reset your Kafka Connect offset data, which contains your resume token, to allow your connector to resume processing your change stream. To reset your offset data, change the value of the offset.partition.name configuration property to a partition name that does not exist on your Kafka deployment. You can set your offset.partition.name property like this: offset.partition.name=<a string>  \nTIP \nNAMING YOUR OFFSET PARTITIONS Consider using the following pattern to name your offset partitions: offset.partition.name=<source connector name>.<monotonically increasing number>  This pattern provides the following benefits:  * Records the number of times you reset your connector  * Documents to which connector an offset partition belongs \nEXAMPLE Assume you named your source connector \"source-values\" and you are setting the offset.partition.name property for the first time. You would configure your connector as follows: offset.partition.name=source-values.1  The next time you reset your connector's offset data, configure your connector as follows: offset.partition.name=source-values.2  To learn more about the offset.partition.name configuration property, see the Error Handling and Resuming from Interruption Properties page. To learn about naming your connector, see the official Apache Kafka documentation. \nPREVENTION \nTo prevent invalid resume token errors caused by an infrequently updated namespace, enable heartbeats. Heartbeats is a feature of your source connector that causes your connector to update its resume token at regular intervals as well as when the contents of your source MongoDB namespace changes. Specify the following option in your source connector configuration to enable heartbeats: heartbeat.interval.ms=<a positive integer>  To learn more about heartbeats, see the Error Handling and Resuming from Interruption Properties guide. ←  TroubleshootingHow to Contribute → On this page  * Overview\n * Stack Trace\n * Cause\n * Solutions\n * Temporarily Tolerate Errors\n * Reset Stored

\nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn about the data formats you use when working with the MongoDB Kafka Connector and your pipeline. This guide uses the following sample document to show the behavior of the different formats: {company:\"MongoDB\"} \nJSON \nJSON is a data-interchange format based on JavaScript object notation. You represent the sample document in JSON like this: {\"company\":\"MongoDB\"} You may encounter the following data formats related to JSON when working with the connector:      * Raw JSON  * BSON  * JSON Schema For more information on JSON, see the official JSON website. \nRAW JSON \nRaw JSON is a data format that consists of JSON objects written as strings. You represent the sample document in Raw JSON like this: \"{\\\"company\\\":\\\"MongoDB\\\"}\" You use Raw JSON when you specify a String converter on a source or sink connector. To view connector configurations that specify a String converter, see the Converters guide. \nBSON \nBSON is a binary serialization encoding for JSON-like objects. BSON encodes the sample document like this: \\x1a\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x02company\\x00\\x08\\x00\\x00\\x00MongoDB\\x00\\x00 Your connectors use the BSON format to send and receive documents from your MongoDB deployment. For more information on BSON, see the BSON specification. \nJSON SCHEMA \nJSON Schema is a syntax for specifying schemas for JSON objects. A schema is a definition attached to an Apache Kafka Topic that defines valid values for that topic. You can specify a schema for the sample document with JSON Schema like this: {   \"$schema\":\"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema\",   \"$id\":\"unique id\",   \"type\":\"object\",   \"title\":\"Example Schema\",   \"description\":\"JSON Schema for the sample document.\",   \"required\":[      \"company\"   ],   \"properties\":{      \"company\":{         \"$id\":\"another unique id\",         \"type\":\"string\",         \"title\":\"Company\",         \"description\":\"A field to hold the name of a company\"      }   },   \"additionalProperties\":false} You use JSON Schema when you apply JSON Schema converters to your connectors. To view connector configurations that specify a JSON Schema converter, see the Converters guide. For more information, see the official JSON Schema website. \nAVRO \nApache Avro is an open-source framework for serializing and transporting data described by schemas. Avro defines two data formats relevant to the connector:  * Avro schema  * Avro binary encoding For more information on Apache Avro, see the Apache Avro Documentation. \nAVRO SCHEMA \nAvro schema is a JSON-based schema definition syntax. Avro schema supports the specification of the following groups of data types:  * Primitive Types  * Complex Types  * Logical Types \nWARNING \nUNSUPPORTED AVRO TYPES The connector does not support the following Avro types:  * enum types. Use string instead.  * fixed types. Use bytes instead.  * null as a primitive type. However, null as an element in a union is supported.  * union types with more than 2 elements.  * union types with more than one null element. \nIMPORTANT \nSINK CONNECTORS AND LOGICAL TYPES The MongoDB Kafka sink connector supports all Avro schema primitive and complex types, however sink connectors support only the following logical types:  * decimal  * date  * time-millis  * time-micros  * timestamp-millis  * timestamp-micros You can construct an Avro schema for the sample document like this: {  \"type\": \"record\",  \"name\": \"example\",  \"doc\": \"example documents have a company field\",  \"fields\": [    {      \"name\": \"company\",      \"type\": \"string\"    }  ]} You use Avro schema when you define a schema for a MongoDB Kafka source connector.

\nAvro specifies a binary serialization encoding for JSON objects defined by an Avro schema. If you use the preceding Avro schema, you can represent the sample document with Avro binary encoding like this: \\x0eMongoDB You use Avro binary encoding when you specify an Avro converter on a source or sink connector. To view connector configurations that specify an Avro converter, see the Converters guide. To learn more about Avro binary encoding, see this section of the Avro specification. \nBYTE ARRAYS \nA byte array is a consecutive sequence of unstructured bytes. You can represent the sample document as a byte array using any of the encodings mentioned above. You use byte arrays when your converters send data to or receive data from Apache Kafka.

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nKAFKA AND KAFKA CONNECT \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Apache Kafka\n * Kafka Connect\n * Diagram \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn the following foundational information about Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect:      * What Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect are  * What problems Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect solve  * Why Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect are useful  * How data moves through an Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect pipeline \nAPACHE KAFKA \nApache Kafka is an open source publish/subscribe messaging system. Apache Kafka provides a flexible, fault tolerant, and horizontally scalable system to move data throughout datastores and applications. A system is fault tolerant if the system can continue operating even if certain components of the system stop working. A system is horizontally scalable if the system can be expanded to handle larger workloads by adding more machines rather than by improving a machine's hardware. For more information on Apache Kafka, see the following resources:  * Confluent \"What is Apache Kafka?\" Page  * Apache Kafka Official Documentation \nKAFKA CONNECT \nKafka Connect is a component of Apache Kafka that solves the problem of connecting Apache Kafka to datastores such as MongoDB. Kafka Connect solves this problem by providing the following resources:  * A fault tolerant runtime for transferring data to and from datastores.  * A framework for the Apache Kafka community to share solutions for connecting Apache Kafka to different datastores. The Kafka Connect framework defines an API for developers to write reusable connectors. Connectors enable Kafka Connect deployments to interact with a specific datastore as a data source or a data sink. The MongoDB Kafka Connector is one of these connectors. For more information on Kafka Connect, see the following resources:  * Confluent Kafka Connect Page  * Apache Kafka Official Documentation, Kafka Connect Guide  * Apache Foundation Video Walk-Through of the Kafka Connect Framework \nTIP \nUSE KAFKA CONNECT INSTEAD OF PRODUCER/CONSUMER CLIENTS WHEN CONNECTING TO DATASTORES While you could write your own application to connect Apache Kafka to a specific datastore using producer and consumer clients, Kafka Connect may be a better fit for you. Here are some reasons to use Kafka Connect:  * Kafka Connect has a fault tolerant distributed architecture to ensure a reliable pipeline.  * There are a large number of community maintained connectors for connecting Apache Kafka to popular datastores like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL using the Kafka Connect framework. This reduces the amount of boilerplate code you need to write and maintain to manage database connections, error handling, dead-letter queue integration, and other problems involved in connecting Apache Kafka with a datastore.  * You have the option to use a managed Kafka Connect cluster from Confluent. \nDIAGRAM \nThe following diagram shows how information flows through an example data pipeline built with Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect. The example pipeline uses a MongoDB cluster as a data source, and a MongoDB cluster as a data sink.  All connectors and datastores in the example pipeline are optional, and you can swap them out for whatever connectors and datastores you need for your deployment. ←  IntroductionInstall the MongoDB

The connector is available for Confluent Platform and Apache Kafka deployments. To see installation instructions for your deployment type, navigate to one of the following sections:      * Install the Connector on Confluent Platform  * Install the Connector on Apache Kafka \nINSTALL THE CONNECTOR ON CONFLUENT PLATFORM \nClick the following tabs to see instructions for how to install the connector on Confluent Platform:   INSTALL THE CONNECTOR ON APACHE KAFKA \n 1. Locate and download the uber JAR to get all the dependencies required for the connector. Check the reference table to find the uber JAR.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    If you are unable to use the uber JAR or prefer to manage your own dependencies, download the JAR that contains the minimum required dependencies and resolve any runtime dependencies. You can use a plugin such as Maven dependency:tree to generate the dependency tree.  2. Copy the JAR and any dependencies into the Kafka plugins directory which you can specify in your plugin.path configuration setting (e.g. plugin.path=/usr/local/share/kafka/plugins). \nNOTE If you intend to run the connector as distributed worker processes, you must repeat this process for each server or virtual machine. \nDOWNLOAD A CONNECTOR JAR FILE \nYou can download the connector source and JAR files from the following locations: Kafka Connector GitHub repository (source code)\nmongodb/mongo-kafka\nMaven Central repository (JAR files)\nmongo-kafka-connect You can identify the contents of the JAR files by the suffix in the filename. Consult the following table for a description of each suffix: Suffix\nDescription\nall\nThe uber JAR that contains the connector, MongoDB dependencies, and Apache Avro\nconfluent\nContains the minimum requirements for the connector and Confluent Platform\njavadoc\nContains the Javadoc documentation for the connector classes\nsources\nContains the source code that corresponds to the compiled

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nCONVERTERS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Available Converters\n * Converters with Schemas\n * Connector Configuration\n * Avro Converter\n * Protobuf Converter\n * JSON Schema Converter\n * JSON Converter\n * String Converter (Raw JSON) \nOVERVIEW \nThis guide describes how to use converters with the MongoDB Kafka Connector. Converters are programs that translate between bytes and Kafka Connect's runtime data format. Converters pass data between Kafka Connect and Apache Kafka. The connector passes data between MongoDB and Kafka Connect. The following diagram shows these relationships:  To learn more about converters, see the following resources:      * Article from Confluent.  * Confluent Article on Kafka Connect Concepts  * Converter Interface API Documentation \nAVAILABLE CONVERTERS \nAs the connector converts your MongoDB data into Kafka Connect's runtime data format, the connector works with all available converters. \nIMPORTANT \nUSE THE SAME CONVERTER FOR YOUR SOURCE AND SINK CONNECTORS You must use the same converter in your MongoDB Kafka source connector and MongoDB Kafka sink connector. For example, if your source connector writes to a topic using Protobuf, your sink connector must use Protobuf to read from the topic. To learn what converter to use, see this page from Confluent. \nCONVERTERS WITH SCHEMAS \nIf you use a schema-based converter such as the Kafka Connect Avro Converter (Avro Converter), Kafka Connect Protobuf Converter, or Kafka Connect JSON Schema Converter, you should define a schema in your source connector. To learn how to specify a schema, see the Apply Schemas guide. \nCONNECTOR CONFIGURATION \nThis section provides templates for properties files to configure the following converters in a connector pipeline:  * Avro Converter  * Protobuf Converter  * JSON Schema Converter  * JSON Converter  * String Converter \nAVRO CONVERTER \nClick the following tabs to view properties files that work with the

You can use the default DefaultNamespaceMapper or specify a custom class. To view only the options related to specifying where the connector writes data, see the MongoDB Namespace Mapping Configuration Properties page. Name\nDescription\nnamespace.mapper\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe fully-qualified class name of the class that specifies which database or collection in which to sink the data. The default DefaultNamespaceMapper uses values specified in the database and collection properties. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: The connector includes an alternative class for specifying the database and collection called FieldPathNamespaceMapper. See the FieldPathNamespaceMapper settings for more information. Default: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.namespace.mapping.DefaultNamespaceMapper \nAccepted Values: A fully qualified Java class name of a class that implements the NamespaceMapper interface.\ndatabase\nRequired \nType: string \nDescription:\nThe name of the MongoDB database to which the sink connector writes. \nAccepted Values: A MongoDB database name\ncollection\nRequired \nType: string \nDescription:\nThe name of the MongoDB collection to which the sink connector writes. If your sink connector follows multiple topics, this is the default collection for any writes that are not otherwise specified. \nAccepted Values: A MongoDB collection name FIELDPATHNAMESPACEMAPPER SETTINGS \nIf you configure your sink connector to use the FieldPathNamespaceMapper, you can specify which database and collection to sink a document based on the data's field values.

It does not match the topic names \"activity.landing.views\" and \"activity.clicks\". \nNOTE You can define either the topics or the topics.regex setting, but not both. Accepted Values: A valid regular expression pattern using java.util.regex.Pattern. \nCONNECTOR MESSAGE PROCESSING \nUse the settings on this page to configure the message processing behavior of the MongoDB Kafka sink connector including the following:  * Message batch size  * Rate limits  * Number of parallel tasks To view only the options related to change data capture handlers, see the Connector Message Processing Properties page. Name\nDescription\nmax.batch.size\nType: int \nDescription:\nMaximum number of sink records to batch together for processing. \nConsider the batch that contains the following records: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] When set to 0, the connector performs a single bulk write for the entire batch. \nWhen set to 1, the connector performs one bulk write for each record in the batch, for a total of five bulk writes as shown in the following example: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] Default: 0\nAccepted Values: An integer\nbulk.write.ordered\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nWhether the connector writes a batch of records as an ordered or unordered bulk write operation. When set to true, the default value, the connector writes a batch of records as an ordered bulk write operation.\nTo learn more about bulk write operations, see the Write Model Strategies page. \nDefault: true\nAccepted Values: true or false\nrate.limiting.every.n\nType: int \nDescription:\nNumber of batches of records the sink connector processes in order to trigger the rate limiting timeout. A value of 0 means no rate limiting. \nDefault: 0\nAccepted Values: An integer\nrate.limiting.timeout\nType: int \nDescription:\nHow long (in milliseconds) to wait before the sink connector should

Name\nDescription\ndocument.id.strategy\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe class the connector should use to generate a unique _id field. \nDefault: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.BsonOidStrategy \nAccepted Values: An empty string or a fully qualified Java class name\ndocument.id.strategy.overwrite.existing\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nWhether the connector should overwrite existing values in the _id field when it applies the strategy defined by the document.id.strategy property. \nDefault: false\nAccepted Values: true or false\ndocument.id.strategy.uuid.format\nType: string \nDescription:\nWhether the connector should output the UUID in the _id field in string format or in BsonBinary format. \nDefault: string\nAccepted Values: string or binary\ndelete.on.null.values\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nWhether the connector should delete documents when the key value matches a document in MongoDB and the value field is null. This setting applies when you specify an id generation strategy that operates on the key document such as FullKeyStrategy, PartialKeyStrategy, and ProvidedInKeyStrategy. \nDefault: false\nAccepted Values: true or false \nWRITE MODEL STRATEGY \nUse the strategies in the following table to specify how the MongoDB Kafka sink connector writes data into MongoDB. You can specify a write strategy with the following configuration: writemodel.strategy=<a writemodel strategy>  To view only the options related to write model strategies, see the Sink Connector Write Model Strategies page. Name\nDescription\nDefaultWriteModelStrategy \nDescription:\nThis strategy uses the ReplaceOneDefaultStrategy by default, and the InsertOneDefaultStrategy if you set the timeseries.timefield option. \nThis is the default value for the writemodel.strategy configuration setting.\nInsertOneDefaultStrategy \nDescription:\nInsert each sink record into MongoDB as a document.\nApply the following configuration to your sink connector to specify this setting: writemodel.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.writemodel.strategy.InsertOneDefaultStrategy \nReplaceOneDefaultStrategy \nDescription:\nReplaces at most one document in MongoDB that matches a sink record by the _id field.

To enable this mapping behavior, set your sink connector namespace.mapper configuration property to the fully-qualified class name as shown below: namespace.mapper=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.namespace.mapping.FieldPathNamespaceMapper  The FieldPathNamespaceMapper requires you to specify the following settings:      * One or both mapping properties to a database and collection  * One of the key or value mappings to a database  * One of the key or value mappings to a collection You can use the following settings to customize the behavior of the FieldPathNamespaceMapper: Name\nDescription\nnamespace.mapper.key.database.field\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe name of the key document field that specifies the name of the database in which to write.\nnamespace.mapper.key.collection.field\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe name of the key document field that specifies the name of the collection in which to write.\nnamespace.mapper.value.database.field\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe name of the value document field that specifies the name of the database in which to write.\nnamespace.mapper.value.collection.field\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe name of the value document field that specifies the name of the collection in which to write.\nnamespace.mapper.error.if.invalid\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nWhether to throw an exception when either the document is missing the mapped field or it has an invalid BSON type.\nWhen set to true, the connector does not process documents missing the mapped field or that contain an invalid BSON type. The connector may halt or skip processing depending on the related error-handling configuration settings.\nWhen set to false, if a document is missing the mapped field or if it has an invalid BSON type, the connector defaults to writing to the specified database and collection settings. \nDefault: false\nAccepted Values: true or false ←  MongoDB Connection Configuration PropertiesKafka Topic

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nSINK CONNECTOR WRITE MODEL STRATEGIES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Strategies \nOVERVIEW \nUse the strategies in the following table to specify how the MongoDB Kafka sink connector writes data into MongoDB. You can specify a write strategy with the following configuration: writemodel.strategy=<a writemodel strategy>  For a list of sink connector configuration settings organized by category, see the guide on Sink Connector Configuration Properties. \nSTRATEGIES \nName\nDescription\nDefaultWriteModelStrategy \nDescription:\nThis strategy uses the ReplaceOneDefaultStrategy by default, and the InsertOneDefaultStrategy if you set the timeseries.timefield option. \nThis is the default value for the writemodel.strategy configuration setting.\nInsertOneDefaultStrategy \nDescription:\nInsert each sink record into MongoDB as a document.\nApply the following configuration to your sink connector to specify this setting: writemodel.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.writemodel.strategy.InsertOneDefaultStrategy \nReplaceOneDefaultStrategy \nDescription:\nReplaces at most one document in MongoDB that matches a sink record by the _id field. If no documents match, insert the sink record as a new document.\nApply the following configuration to your sink connector to specify this setting: writemodel.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.writemodel.strategy.ReplaceOneDefaultStrategy \nReplaceOneBusinessKeyStrategy \nDescription:\nReplaces at most one document that matches a sink record by a specified business key. If no documents match, insert the sink record as a new document.\nApply the following configuration to your sink connector to specify this setting: writemodel.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.writemodel.strategy.ReplaceOneBusinessKeyStrategy \nTo see an example showing how to use this strategy, see our guide on write model strategies.\nDeleteOneDefaultStrategy \nDescription:\nDeletes at most one document that matches your sink connector's key structure by the _id field only when the document contains a null value structure.\nThis is implicitly specified when you set mongodb.delete.on.null.values=true.\nYou can set this explicitly with the following configuration: writemodel.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.writemodel.strategy.DeleteOneDefaultStrategy \nDeleteOneBusinessKeyStrategy \nDescription:\nDeletes at most one MongoDB document that matches a sink

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nTOPIC OVERRIDE PROPERTIES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Settings\n * Example \nOVERVIEW \nUse the following MongoDB Kafka sink connector configuration settings to override global or default property settings for specific topics. For a list of sink connector configuration settings organized by category, see the guide on Sink Connector Configuration Properties. \nSETTINGS \nName\nDescription\ntopic.override.<topicName>.<propertyName>\nType: string \nDescription:\nSpecify a topic and property name to override the corresponding global or default property setting. \nEXAMPLE The topic.override.foo.collection=bar setting instructs the sink connector to store data from the foo topic in the bar collection. \nNOTE You can specify any valid configuration setting in the <propertyName> segment on a per-topic basis except connection.uri and topics. Default: \"\"\nAccepted Values: Accepted values specific to the overridden property \nEXAMPLE \nYou can override the sink connector to sink data from specific topics. The following example configuration shows how you can define configuration settings for a topic named topicA: topic.override.topicA.collection=collectionAtopic.override.topicA.max.batch.size=100topic.override.topicA.document.id.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.UuidStrategytopic.override.topicA.post.processor.chain=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.DocumentIdAdder,com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.BlockListValueProjectortopic.override.topicA.value.projection.type=BlockListtopic.override.topicA.value.projection.list=k2,k4  After applying these configuration settings, the sink connector performs the following for data consumed from topicA:      * Write documents to the MongoDB collection collectionA in batches of up to 100.  * Generate a UUID value for each new document and write it to the _id field.  * Omit fields k2 and k4 from the value projection using the BlockList projection type.

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nCONNECTOR MESSAGE PROCESSING PROPERTIES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Settings \nOVERVIEW \nUse the settings on this page to configure the message processing behavior of the MongoDB Kafka sink connector including the following:      * Message batch size  * Rate limits  * Number of parallel tasks For a list of sink connector configuration settings organized by category, see the guide on Sink Connector Configuration Properties. \nSETTINGS \nName\nDescription\nmax.batch.size\nType: int \nDescription:\nMaximum number of sink records to batch together for processing. \nConsider the batch that contains the following records: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] When set to 0, the connector performs a single bulk write for the entire batch. \nWhen set to 1, the connector performs one bulk write for each record in the batch, for a total of five bulk writes as shown in the following example: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] Default: 0\nAccepted Values: An integer\nbulk.write.ordered\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nWhether the connector writes a batch of records as an ordered or unordered bulk write operation. When set to true, the default value, the connector writes a batch of records as an ordered bulk write operation.\nTo learn more about bulk write operations, see the Write Model Strategies page. \nDefault: true\nAccepted Values: true or false\nrate.limiting.every.n\nType: int \nDescription:\nNumber of batches of records the sink connector processes in order to trigger the rate limiting timeout. A value of 0 means no rate limiting. \nDefault: 0\nAccepted Values: An integer\nrate.limiting.timeout\nType: int \nDescription:\nHow long (in milliseconds) to wait before the sink connector should resume processing after reaching the rate limiting threshold. \nDefault: 0\nAccepted Values: An integer\ntasks.max\nType: int \nDescription:\nThe maximum number of tasks to create for this connector. The connector may create fewer than the maximum tasks specified if it cannot handle the level of parallelism you specify. \nIMPORTANT \nMULTIPLE TASKS MAY PROCESS MESSAGES OUT OF ORDER If you specify a value greater than 1, the connector enables parallel processing of the tasks.

\nOVERVIEW \nUse the following configuration settings to specify how the MongoDB Kafka sink connector handles errors and to configure the dead letter queue. For a list of sink connector configuration settings organized by category, see the guide on Sink Connector Configuration Properties. \nSETTINGS \nName\nDescription\nmongo.errors.tolerance\nType: string \nDescription:\nWhether to continue processing messages if the connector encounters an error. Allows the connector to override the errors.tolerance Kafka cluster setting.\nWhen set to none, the connector reports any error and blocks further processing of the rest of the messages.\nWhen set to all, the connector ignores any problematic messages.\nTo learn more about error handling strategies, see the Handle Errors page. \nNOTE This property overrides the errors.tolerance property of the Connect Framework. Default: Inherits the value from the errors.tolerance setting.\nAccepted Values: \"none\" or \"all\"\nmongo.errors.log.enable\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nWhether the connector should write details of errors including failed operations to the log file. The connector classifies errors as \"tolerated\" or \"not tolerated\" using the errors.tolerance or mongo.errors.tolerance settings.\nWhen set to true, the connector logs both \"tolerated\" and \"not tolerated\" errors.\nWhen set to false, the connector logs \"not tolerated\" errors. \nNOTE This property overrides the errors.log.enable property of the Connect Framework.

The connector sends an ordered bulk write operation to MongoDB  2. MongoDB fails to process a write operation in the ordered bulk write  3. MongoDB does not attempt to perform all subsequent write operations in the ordered bulk write To learn how to set the connector to perform unordered bulk write operations, see the Connector Message Processing Properties page.\nMessage Format: This exception produces no message. To enable bulk write exception reporting to the dead letter queue, use the following connector configuration: errors.tolerance=allerrors.deadletterqueue.topic.name=<name of topic to use as dead letter queue>errors.deadletterqueue.context.headers.enable=true  \nDEAD LETTER QUEUE CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE \nApache Kafka version 2.6 added support for handling errant records. The Kafka connector automatically sends messages that it cannot process to the dead letter queue. Once on the dead letter queue, you can inspect the errant records, update them, and resubmit them for processing. The following is an example configuration for enabling the dead letter queue topic example.deadletterqueue. This configuration specifies that the dead letter queue and log file should record invalid messages, and that the dead letter queue messages should include context headers. mongo.errors.tolerance=allmongo.errors.log.enable=trueerrors.log.include.messages=trueerrors.deadletterqueue.topic.name=example.deadletterqueueerrors.deadletterqueue.context.headers.enable=true  To

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nKAFKA TIME SERIES PROPERTIES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Settings \nOVERVIEW \nUse the following configuration settings to specify how the MongoDB Kafka sink connector should sink data to a MongoDB time series collection. For a list of sink connector configuration settings organized by category, see the guide on Sink Connector Configuration Properties. \nSETTINGS \nName\nDescription\ntimeseries.timefield\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe name of the top-level field in the source data that contains time information that you want to associate with the new document in the time series collection. \nDefault: \"\"\nAccepted Values: An empty string or the name of a field that contains a BSON DateTime value\ntimeseries.timefield.auto.convert.date.format\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe date format pattern the connector should use to convert the source data contained in the field specified by the timeseries.timefield setting. The connector passes the date format pattern to the Java DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(pattern, locale) method to perform date and time conversions on the time field.\nIf the date value from the source data only contains date information, the connector sets the time information to the start of the specified day. If the date value does not contain the timezone offset, the connector sets the offset to UTC. \nDefault: yyyy-MM-dd[['T'][ ]][HH:mm:ss[[.][SSSSSS][SSS]][ ]VV[ ]'['VV']'][HH:mm:ss[[.][SSSSSS][SSS]][ ]X][HH:mm:ss[[.][SSSSSS][SSS]]] \nAccepted Values: A valid DateTimeFormatter format\ntimeseries.timefield.auto.convert\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nWhether to convert the data in the field into the BSON Date format.\nWhen set to true, the connector uses the milliseconds after epoch and discards fractional parts if the value is a number. If the value is a string, the connector uses the setting in the following configuration to parse the date: timeseries.timefield.auto.convert.date.format \nIf the connector fails to convert the value, it sends the original value to the time series collection. \nDefault: false\nAccepted Values: true or false\ntimeseries.timefield.auto.convert.locale.language.tag\nType: string \nDescription:\nWhich DateTimeFormatter locale language tag to use with the date format pattern (e.g. \"en-US\"). For more information on locales, see the Java SE documentation of Locale. \nDefault: ROOT\nAccepted Values: A valid Locale language tag format\ntimeseries.metafield\nType: string \nDescription:\nWhich top-level field to read from the source data to describe a group of related time series documents. \nIMPORTANT This field must not be the _id field nor the field you specified in the timeseries.timefield setting. Default: \"\"\nAccepted Values: An empty string or the name of a field that contains any BSON type except BsonArray.\ntimeseries.expire.after.seconds\nType: int \nDescription:\nThe number of seconds MongoDB should wait before automatically removing the time series collection data. The connector disables timed expiry when the setting value is less than 1. For more information on this collection setting, see the MongoDB Server Manual page on Automatic Removal for Time Series Collections. \nDefault: 0\nAccepted Values: An integer\ntimeseries.granularity\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe expected interval between subsequent measurements of your source data. For more information on this setting, see the MongoDB Server Manual page on Granularity for Time Series Data. \nOptional\nDefault: \"\"\nAccepted Values: \"\", \"seconds\", \"minutes\", \"hours\" For

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nCHANGE DATA CAPTURE HANDLERS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Specify a CDC Handler\n * Available CDC Handlers\n * Create Your Own CDC Handler\n * How to Use Your CDC Handler \nOVERVIEW \nLearn how to replicate your change data capture (CDC) events with a MongoDB Kafka sink connector. CDC is a software architecture that converts changes in a datastore into a stream of CDC events. A CDC event is a message containing a reproducible representation of a change performed on a datastore. Replicating data is the process of applying the changes contained in CDC events from one data store onto a different datastore so that the changes occur in both datastores. Use a CDC handler to replicate CDC events stored on an Apache Kafka topic into MongoDB. A CDC handler is a program that translates CDC events from a specific CDC event producer into MongoDB write operations. A CDC event producer is an application that generates CDC events. CDC event producers can be datastores, or applications that watch datastores and generate CDC events corresponding to changes in the datastores. \nNOTE MongoDB change streams is an example of a CDC architecture. To learn more about change streams, see the MongoDB Kafka Connector guide on Change Streams. If you would like to view a tutorial demonstrating how to replicate data, see the Replicate Data With a Change Data Capture Handler tutorial. \nIMPORTANT \nCDC AND POST PROCESSORS You cannot apply a post processor to CDC event data. If you attempt to specify both, the connector logs a warning. \nSPECIFY A CDC HANDLER \nYou can specify a CDC handler on your sink connector with the following configuration option: change.data.capture.handler=<cdc handler class>  To learn more, see change data capture configuration options. \nAVAILABLE CDC HANDLERS \nThe sink connector provides CDC handlers for the following CDC event producers:      * MongoDB  * Debezium  * Qlik Replicate Click the following tabs to learn how to configure CDC handlers for the preceding event producers:   CREATE YOUR OWN CDC HANDLER \nIf none of the prebuilt CDC handlers fit your use case, you can create your own. Your custom CDC handler is a Java class that implements the CdcHandler interface. To learn more, see the source code for the CdcHandler interface. To view examples of CDC handler implementations, see the source code for the prebuilt CDC handlers. \nHOW TO USE YOUR CDC HANDLER \nTo configure your sink connector to use your custom CDC Handler, you must perform the following actions:  1. Compile your custom CDC handler class to a JAR file.  2. Add the compiled JAR to the classpath/plugin path for your Kafka workers. For more information about plugin paths, see the Confluent documentation.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    Kafka Connect loads plugins in isolation. When you deploy a custom write strategy, both the connector JAR and the CDC handler JAR should be on the same path. Your paths should resemble the following:\n    \n    <plugin.path>/mongo-kafka-connect/mongo-kafka-connect-all.jar\n    <plugin.path>/mongo-kafka-connect/custom-CDC-handler.jar\n    \n    To learn more about Kafka Connect plugins, see this guide from Confluent.  3. Specify your custom class in the change.data.capture.handler configuration setting. To learn how to compile a class to a JAR file, see this guide from Oracle. ←  Error HandlingSource Connector → On this page  * Overview\n * Specify a CDC Handler\n * Available CDC Handlers\n * Create

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nWRITE MODEL STRATEGIES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Bulk Write Operations\n * How to Specify Write Model Strategies\n * Specify a Business Key\n * Examples\n * Update One Timestamps Strategy\n * Replace One Business Key Strategy\n * Delete One Business Key Strategy\n * Custom Write Model Strategies\n * Sample Write Model Strategy\n * How to Install Your Strategy \nOVERVIEW \nThis guide shows you how to change the way your MongoDB Kafka sink connector writes data to MongoDB. You can change how your connector writes data to MongoDB for use cases including the following:      * Insert documents instead of upserting them  * Replace documents that match a filter other than the _id field  * Delete documents that match a filter You can configure how your connector writes data to MongoDB by specifying a write model strategy. A write model strategy is a class that defines how your sink connector should write data using write models. A write model is a MongoDB Java driver interface that defines the structure of a write operation. To learn how to modify the sink records your connector receives before your connector writes them to MongoDB, read the guide on Sink Connector Post Processors. To see a write model strategy implementation, see the source code of the InsertOneDefaultStrategy class. \nBULK WRITE OPERATIONS \nThe sink connector writes data to MongoDB using bulk write operations. Bulk writes group multiple write operations, such as inserts, updates, or deletes, together. By default, the sink connector performs ordered bulk writes, which guarantee the order of data changes. In an ordered bulk write, if any write operation results in an error, the connector skips the remaining writes in that batch. If you don't need to guarantee the order of data changes, you can set the bulk.write.ordered setting to false so that the connector performs unordered bulk writes. The sink connector performs unordered bulk writes in parallel, which can improve performance. In addition, when you enable unordered bulk writes and set the errors.tolerance setting to all, even if any write operation in your bulk write fails, the connector continues to perform the remaining write operations in the batch that do not return errors. \nTIP To learn more about the bulk.write.ordered setting, see the Connector Message Processing Properties. To learn more about bulk write operations, see the following documentation:  * Server manual entry on ordered and unordered bulk operations.  * Bulk write operations in Java \nHOW TO SPECIFY WRITE MODEL STRATEGIES \nTo specify a write model strategy, use the following setting: writemodel.strategy=<write model strategy classname>  For a list of the pre-built write model strategies included in the connector, see the guide on write model strategy configurations. \nSPECIFY A BUSINESS KEY \nA business key is a value composed of one or more fields in your sink record that identifies it as unique. By default, the sink connector uses the _id field of the sink record to retrieve the business key. To specify a different business key, configure the Document Id Adder post processor to use a custom value. You can configure the Document Id Adder to set the _id field from the sink record key as shown in the following example properties: document.id.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.PartialKeyStrategydocument.id.strategy.partial.key.projection.list=<comma-separated field names>document.id.strategy.partial.key.projection.type=AllowList  Alternatively, you can configure it to set the _id field from the sink record value as shown in the following example properties: document.id.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.PartialValueStrategydocument.id.strategy.partial.value.projection.list=<comma-separated field names>document.id.strategy.partial.value.projection.type=AllowList  \nIMPORTANT \nIMPROVE WRITE PERFORMANCE Create a unique index in your target collection that corresponds to the fields of your business key. This improves the performance of write operations from your sink connector. See the guide on unique indexes for more information. The following write model strategies require a business key:  * ReplaceOneBusinessKeyStrategy  * DeleteOneBusinessKeyStrategy  * UpdateOneBusinessKeyTimestampStrategy For more information on the

 * Replace One Business Key Strategy  * Delete One Business Key Strategy \nUPDATE ONE TIMESTAMPS STRATEGY \nYou can configure the Update One Timestamps strategy to add and update timestamps when writing documents to MongoDB. This strategy performs the following actions:  * When the connector inserts a new MongoDB document, it sets the _insertedTS and _modifiedTS fields to the current time on the connector's server.  * When the connector updates an existing MongoDB document, it updates the _modifiedTS field to the current time on the connector's server. Suppose you want to track the position of a train along a route, and your sink connector receives messages with the following structure: {  \"_id\": \"MN-1234\",  \"start\": \"Beacon\",  \"destination\": \"Grand Central\"  \"position\": [ 40, -73 ]}  Use the ProvidedInValueStrategy to specify that your connector should use the _id value of the message to assign the _id field in your MongoDB document. Specify your id and write model strategy properties as follows: document.id.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.ProvidedInValueStrategywritemodel.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.writemodel.strategy.UpdateOneTimestampsStrategy  After your sink connector processes the preceding example record, it inserts a document that contains the _insertedTS and _modifiedTS fields as shown in the following document: {  \"_id\": \"MN-1234\",  \"_insertedTS\": ISODate(\"2021-09-20T15:08:000Z\"),  \"_modifiedTS\": ISODate(\"2021-09-20T15:08:000Z\"),  \"start\": \"Beacon\",  \"destination\": \"Grand Central\"  \"position\": [ 40, -73 ]}  After one hour, the train reports its new location along its route with a new position as shown in the following record: {  \"_id\": \"MN-1234\",  \"start\": \"Beacon\",  \"destination\": \"Grand Central\"  \"position\": [ 42, -75 ]}  Once your sink connector processes the preceding record, it inserts a document that contains the following data: {  \"_id\": \"MN-1234\",  \"_insertedTS\": ISODate(\"2021-09-20T15:08:000Z\"),  \"_modifiedTS\": ISODate(\"2021-09-20T16:08:000Z\"),  \"start\": \"Beacon\",  \"destination\": \"Grand Central\"  \"position\": [ 42, -75 ]}  For more information on the ProvidedInValueStrategy, see the section on how to Configure the Document Id Adder Post Processor. \nREPLACE ONE BUSINESS KEY STRATEGY \nYou can configure the Replace One Business Key strategy to replace documents that match the value of the business key. To define a business key on multiple fields of a record and configure the connector to replace documents that contain matching business keys, perform the following tasks:  1. Create a unique index in your collection that corresponds to your business key fields.  2. Specify the PartialValueStrategy id strategy to identify the fields that belong to the business key in the connector configuration.  3. Specify the ReplaceOneBusinessKeyStrategy write model strategy in the connector configuration. Suppose you want to track airplane capacity by the flight number and airport location represented by flight_no and airport_code, respectively. An example message contains the following information: {  \"flight_no\": \"Z342\",  \"airport_code\": \"LAX\",  \"seats\": {    \"capacity\": 180,    \"occupied\": 152  }}  To implement the strategy, using flight_no and airport_code as the business key, first create a unique index on these fields in the MongoDB shell: db.collection.createIndex({ \"flight_no\": 1, \"airport_code\": 1}, { unique: true })  Next, specify the PartialValueStrategy strategy and business key fields in the a projection list.

 The sample data inserted into the collection contains the following: {  \"flight_no\": \"Z342\"  \"airport_code\": \"LAX\",  \"seats\": {    \"capacity\": 180,    \"occupied\": 152  }}  When the connector processes sink data that matches the business key of the existing document, it replaces the document with the new values without changing the business key fields: {  \"flight_no\": \"Z342\"  \"airport_code\": \"LAX\",  \"status\": \"canceled\"}  After the connector processes the sink data, it replaces the original sample document in MongoDB with the preceding one. \nDELETE ONE BUSINESS KEY STRATEGY \nYou can configure the connector to remove a document when it receives messages that match a business key using the Delete One Business Key strategy. To set a business key from multiple fields of a record and configure the connector to delete a document that contains a matching business key, perform the following tasks:  1. Create a unique index in your MongoDB collection that corresponds to your business key fields.  2. Specify the PartialValueStrategy as the id strategy to identify the fields that belong to the business key in the connector configuration.  3. Specify the DeleteOneBusinessKeyStrategy write model strategy in the connector configuration. Suppose you need to delete a calendar event from a specific year from a collection that contains a document that resembles the following: {  \"year\": 2005,  \"month\": 3,  \"day\": 15,  \"event\": \"Dentist Appointment\"} To implement the strategy, using year as the business key, first create a unique index on these fields in the MongoDB shell: db.collection.createIndex({ \"year\": 1 }, { unique: true })  Next, specify your business key and write model strategy in your configuration as follows: document.id.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.PartialValueStrategydocument.id.strategy.partial.value.projection.list=yeardocument.id.strategy.partial.value.projection.type=AllowListwritemodel.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.writemodel.strategy.DeleteOneBusinessKeyStrategy  If your connector processes a sink record that contains the business key year, it deletes the first document with a matching field value returned by MongoDB. Suppose your connector processes a sink record that contains the following value data: {  \"year\": 2005,  ...}  When the connector processes the preceding record, it deletes the first document from the collection that contains a year field with a value of \"2005\" such as the original \"Dentist Appointment\" sample document. \nCUSTOM WRITE MODEL STRATEGIES \nIf none of the write model strategies included with the connector fit your use case, you can create your own. A write model strategy is a Java class that implements the WriteModelStrategy interface and must override the createWriteModel() method. See the source code for the WriteModelStrategy interface for the required method signature. \nSAMPLE WRITE MODEL STRATEGY \nThe following custom write model strategy returns a write operation that replaces a MongoDB document that matches the _id field of your sink record with the value of the fullDocument field of your sink record: /** * Custom write model strategy * * This class reads the 'fullDocument' field from a change stream and * returns a ReplaceOne operation. */\npublic class CustomWriteModelStrategy implements WriteModelStrategy {\n  private static String ID = \"_id\";  @Override  public WriteModel<BsonDocument> createWriteModel(final SinkDocument document) {    BsonDocument changeStreamDocument = document.getValueDoc()        .orElseThrow(() -> new DataException(\"Missing value document\"));\n    BsonDocument fullDocument = changeStreamDocument.getDocument(\"fullDocument\", new BsonDocument());    if (fullDocument.isEmpty()) {      return null; // Return null to indicate no op.    }\n    return new ReplaceOneModel<>(Filters.eq(ID, fullDocument.get(ID)), fullDocument);  }}  For another example of a custom write model strategy, see the UpsertAsPartOfDocumentStrategy example strategy on GitHub. \nHOW TO INSTALL YOUR STRATEGY \nTo configure your sink connector to use a custom write strategy, you must complete the following actions:  1.

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nERROR HANDLING \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Handle Errors\n * Stop For All Errors\n * Tolerate All Errors\n * Write Errors and Errant Messages to a Topic\n * Log Errors\n * Handle Errors at the Connector Level \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to handle errors in your MongoDB Kafka sink connector. The following list shows some common scenarios that cause your sink connector to experience an error:      * You write to a topic using Avro serialization and try to decode your messages from that topic using Protobuf deserialization  * You use a change data capture handler on a message that does not contain change event documents  * You apply an invalid single message transform to incoming documents When your sink connector encounters an error it does two actions:  * Handles the Error  * Logs the Error \nHANDLE ERRORS \nWhen your connector encounters an error, it needs to handle it in some way. Your sink connector can do the following in response to an error:  * Stop For All Errors default  * Tolerate All Errors  * Write Errors and Errant Messages to a Topic \nSTOP FOR ALL ERRORS \nBy default, your sink connector terminates and stops processing messages when it encounters an error. This is a good option for you if any error in your sink connector indicates a serious problem. When your sink connector crashes, you must do one of the following actions and then restart your connector to resume processing messages:  * Allow your sink connector to temporarily tolerate errors  * Update your sink connector's configuration to allow it to process the message  * Remove the errant message from your topic You can have your sink connector stop when it encounters an error by either not specifying any value for the errors.tolerance option, or by adding the following to your connector configuration: errors.tolerance=none  \nTOLERATE ALL ERRORS \nYou can configure your sink connector to tolerate all errors and never stop processing messages. This is a good option for getting your sink connector up and running quickly, but you run the risk of missing problems in your connector as you do not receive any feedback if something goes wrong. You can have your sink connector tolerate all errors by specifying the following option: errors.tolerance=all  \nWARNING \nORDERED BULK WRITES CAN RESULT IN SKIPPED MESSAGES If you set your connector to tolerate errors and use ordered bulk writes, you may lose data. If you set your connector to tolerate errors and use unordered bulk writes, you lose less data. To learn more about bulk write operations, see the Write Model Strategies page. \nWRITE ERRORS AND ERRANT MESSAGES TO A TOPIC \nYou can configure your sink connector to write errors and errant messages to a topic, called a dead letter queue, for you to inspect or process further. A dead letter queue is a location in message queueing systems such as Apache Kafka where the system routes errant messages instead of crashing or ignoring the error. Dead letter queues combine the feedback of stopping the program with the durability of tolerating all errors, and are a good error handling starting point for most deployments. You can have your sink connector route all errant messages to a dead letter queue by specifying the following options: errors.tolerance=allerrors.deadletterqueue.topic.name=<name of topic to use as dead letter queue>  If you want to include the specific reason for the error as well as the errant message, use the following option: errors.deadletterqueue.context.headers.enable=true  To learn more about dead letter queues, see Confluent's guide on Dead Letter Queues. To view another dead letter queue configuration example, see Dead Letter Queue Configuration Example. To learn about the exceptions your connector defines and writes as context headers to the dead letter queue, see Bulk Write Exceptions. \nLOG ERRORS \nYou can record tolerated and untolerated errors to a log file. Click on the tabs to see how to log errors:  \nIf you would like to log metadata about your message, such as your message's topic and offset, use the following option: errors.log.include.messages=true  For more information, see Confluent's guide on logging with Kafka Connect. \nHANDLE ERRORS AT THE CONNECTOR LEVEL \nThe sink connector provides options that allow you to configure error handling at the connector level. The options are as follows: Kafka Connect Option\nMongoDB Kafka Connector Option\nerrors.tolerance\nmongo.errors.tolerance\nerrors.log.enable\nmongo.errors.log.enable You want to use these options if you want your connector to respond differently to errors related to MongoDB than to errors related to the Kafka Connect

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nMIGRATE AN EXISTING COLLECTION TO A TIME SERIES COLLECTION \nOn this page    \n * Migrate a Collection to a Time Series Collection\n   \n * Summary\n * Learn More Follow this tutorial to learn how to convert an existing MongoDB collection to a time series collection using the MongoDB Kafka Connector. Time series collections efficiently store time series data. Time series data consists of measurements taken at time intervals, metadata that describes the measurement, and the time of the measurement. To convert data from a MongoDB collection to a time series collection using the connector, you need to perform the following tasks:       1. Identify the time field common to all documents in the collection.  2. Configure a source connector to copy the existing collection data to a Kafka topic.  3. Configure a sink connector to copy the Kafka topic data to the time series collection. In this tutorial, you perform these preceding tasks to migrate stock data from a collection to a time series collection. The time series collection stores and indexes the data more efficiently and retains the ability to analyze stock performance over time using aggregation operators. \nMIGRATE A COLLECTION TO A TIME SERIES COLLECTION \n1 \nCOMPLETE THE TUTORIAL SETUP \nComplete the steps in the Kafka Connector Tutorial Setup to start the the Confluent Kafka Connect and MongoDB environment. 2 \nGENERATE SAMPLE DATA \nRun the following command to start a script in your Docker environment that generates a sample collection containing fabricated stock symbols and their prices in your tutorial MongoDB replica set: docker exec -ti mongo1 /bin/bash -c \"cd /stockgenmongo/ && python3 stockgen.py -db Stocks -col PriceData\"  Once the data generator starts running, you should see the generated data that resembles the following: ...1 _id=528e9...

Run the following command in the shell to start the source connector using the configuration file you created: cx stock-source.json  \nNOTE The cx command is a custom script included in the tutorial development environment. This script runs the following equivalent request to the Kafka Connect REST API to create a new connector: curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @stock-source.json http://connect:8083/connectors -w \"\\n\"  Run the following command in the shell to check the status of the connectors: status  If your source connector started successfully, you should see the

Once the source connector starts up, confirm the Kafka topic received the collection data by running the following command: kafkacat -b broker:29092 -C -t marketdata.Stocks.PriceData  The output should show topic data as it is published by the source connector that resembles the following: {\"schema\":{ ... }, \"payload\": \"{ \"_id\": { \"$oid\": \"628e9...\"}, \"company_symbol\": \"MSP\", \"Company_name\": \"MASSIVE SUBMARINE PARTNERS\", \"price\": 309.98, \"tx_time\": { \"$date\": 16535...\" }\"} You can exit kafkacat by typing CTRL+C. 4 \nCONFIGURE THE SINK CONNECTOR \nConfigure a sink connector to read data from the Kafka topic and write it to a time series collection named StockDataMigrate in a database named Stocks. Create a sink configuration file called stock-sink.json with the following command: nano stock-sink.json  Paste the following configuration information into the file and save your changes: {  \"name\": \"mongo-sink-marketdata\",  \"config\": {    \"connector.class\": \"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSinkConnector\",    \"topics\": \"marketdata.Stocks.PriceData\",    \"connection.uri\": \"mongodb://mongo1\",    \"database\": \"Stocks\",    \"collection\": \"StockDataMigrate\",    \"key.converter\": \"org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter\",    \"value.converter\": \"org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter\",    \"timeseries.timefield\": \"tx_time\",    \"timeseries.timefield.auto.convert\": \"true\",    \"timeseries.timefield.auto.convert.date.format\": \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'\"  }}  \nTIP The sink connector configuration above uses the time field date format converter. Alternatively, you can use the TimestampConverter Single Message Transform (SMT) to convert the tx_time field from a String to an ISODate. When using the TimestampConverter SMT, you must define a schema for the data in the Kafka topic. For information on how to use the TimestampConverter SMT, see the TimestampConverter Confluent documentation. Run the following command in the shell to start the sink connector using the configuration file you updated: cx stock-sink.json  After your sink connector finishes processing the topic data, the documents in the StockDataMigrate time series collection contain the tx_time field with an ISODate type value. 5 \nVERIFY THE TIME SERIES COLLECTION DATA \nOnce the sink connector completes processing the topic data, the StockDataMigrate time series collection should contain all the market data from your PriceData collection. To view the data in MongoDB, run the following command to connect to your replica set using mongosh: mongosh \"mongodb://mongo1\"  At the prompt, type the following commands to retrieve all the documents in the Stocks.StockDataMigrate MongoDB namespace: use Stocksdb.StockDataMigrate.find()  You should see a list of documents returned from the command that resemble the following document: {    tx_time: ISODate(\"2022-05-25T21:16:35.983Z\"),    _id: ObjectId(\"628e9...\"),    symbol: 'FAV',    price: 18.43,    company_name: 'FUZZY ATTACK VENTURES'} \nSUMMARY \nIn this tutorial, you created a stock ticker data generator that periodically wrote data into a MongoDB collection. You configured a source connector to copy the data into a Kafka topic and configured a sink connector to write that data into a new MongoDB time series collection. \nLEARN MORE \nRead the following

A CDC handler is an application that translates CDC events into MongoDB write operations. Use a CDC handler when you need to reproduce the changes in one datastore into another datastore. In this tutorial, you configure and run MongoDB Kafka source and sink connectors to make two MongoDB collections contain the same documents using CDC. The source connector writes change stream data from the original collection to a Kafka topic and the sink connector writes the Kafka topic data to the target MongoDB collection. If you want to learn more about how CDC handlers work, see the Change Data Capture Handlers guide. \nREPLICATE DATA WITH A CDC HANDLER \n1 \nCOMPLETE THE TUTORIAL SETUP \nComplete the steps in the Kafka Connector Tutorial Setup to start the the Confluent Kafka Connect and MongoDB environment. 2 \nSTART INTERACTIVE SHELLS \nStart two interactive shells on the Docker container in separate windows. In the tutorial, you can use the shells to run and observe different tasks. Run the following command from a terminal to start an interactive shell. docker exec -it mongo1 /bin/bash  We will refer to this interactive shell as CDCShell1 throughout this tutorial. Run the following command in a second terminal to start an interactive shell: docker exec -it mongo1 /bin/bash  We will refer to this interactive shell as CDCShell2 throughout this tutorial. Arrange the two windows on your screen to keep both of them visible to see real-time updates. Use CDCShell1 to configure your connectors and monitor your Kafka topic. Use CDCShell2 to perform write operations in MongoDB. 3 \nCONFIGURE THE SOURCE CONNECTOR \nIn CDCShell1, configure a source connector to read from the CDCTutorial.Source MongoDB namespace and write to the CDCTutorial.Source Kafka topic. Create a configuration file called cdc-source.json using the following command: nano cdc-source.json  Paste the following configuration information into the file and save your changes: {  \"name\": \"mongo-cdc-source\",  \"config\": {    \"connector.class\": \"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector\",    \"connection.uri\": \"mongodb://mongo1\",    \"database\": \"CDCTutorial\",    \"collection\": \"Source\"  }}  Run the following command in CDCShell1 to start the source connector using the configuration file you created: cx cdc-source.json  \nNOTE The cx command is a custom script included in the tutorial development environment. This script runs the following equivalent request to the Kafka Connect REST API to create a new connector: curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @cdc-source.json http://connect:8083/connectors -w \"\\n\"  Run the following command in the shell to check the status of the connectors: status  If your source connector started successfully, you should see the following output: Kafka topics:...The status of the connectors:\nsource  |  mongo-cdc-source  |  RUNNING  |  RUNNING  |  com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector\nCurrently configured connectors\n[\"mongo-cdc-source\"]... 4 \nCONFIGURE THE SINK CONNECTOR \nIn CDCShell1, configure a sink connector to copy data from the CDCTutorial.Source Kafka topic to CDCTutorial.Destination MongoDB namespace.

You should see the following topic message in your CDCShell1 window: {  \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"optional\": false },  \"payload\": {    \"_id\": { \"_data\": \"8260...\" },    \"operationType\": \"insert\",    \"clusterTime\": { \"$timestamp\": { \"t\": 1611..., \"i\": 2 } },    \"wallTime\": { \"$date\": \"...\" },    \"fullDocument\": {      \"_id\": { \"$oid\": \"600b38ad...\" },      \"proclaim\": \"Hello World!\"    },    \"ns\": { \"db\": \"CDCTutorial\", \"coll\": \"Source\" },    \"documentKey\": { \"_id\": { \"$oid\": \"600b38a...\" } }  }} The sink connector picks up the Kafka message and sinks the data into MongoDB. You can retrieve the document from the CDCTutorial.Destination namespace in MongoDB by running the following command in the MongoDB shell you started in CDCShell2: db.Destination.find()  You should see the following document returned as the result: [  {    _id: ObjectId(\"600b38a...\"),    proclaim: 'Hello World'  }] 7 \n(OPTIONAL) GENERATE ADDITIONAL CHANGES \nTry removing documents from the CDCTutorial.Source namespace by running the following command from the MongoDB shell: db.Source.deleteMany({})  You should see the following topic message in your CDCShell1 window: {  \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"optional\": false },  \"payload\": {    \"_id\": { \"_data\": \"8261....\" },    ...    \"operationType\": \"delete\",    \"clusterTime\": { \"$timestamp\": { \"t\": 1631108282, \"i\": 1 } },    \"ns\": { \"db\": \"CDCTutorial\", \"coll\": \"Source\" },    \"documentKey\": { \"_id\": { \"$oid\": \"6138...\" } }  }} Run the following command to retrieve the current

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nGETTING STARTED WITH THE MONGODB KAFKA SINK CONNECTOR \nOn this page    \n * Get Started with the MongoDB Kafka Sink Connector\n   \n * Summary\n * Learn More Follow this tutorial to learn how to configure a MongoDB Kafka sink connector to read data from an Apache Kafka topic and write it to a MongoDB collection. \nGET STARTED WITH THE MONGODB KAFKA SINK CONNECTOR \n1 \nCOMPLETE THE TUTORIAL SETUP \nComplete the steps in the Kafka Connector Tutorial Setup to start the the Confluent Kafka Connect and MongoDB environment. 2 \nCONFIGURE THE SINK CONNECTOR \nCreate an interactive shell session on the tutorial Docker Container using the following command: docker exec -it mongo1 /bin/bash  Create a source configuration file called simplesink.json with the following command: nano simplesink.json  Paste the following configuration information into the file and save your changes: {  \"name\": \"mongo-tutorial-sink\",  \"config\": {    \"connector.class\": \"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSinkConnector\",    \"topics\": \"Tutorial2.pets\",    \"connection.uri\": \"mongodb://mongo1\",    \"key.converter\": \"org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter\",    \"value.converter\": \"org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter\",    \"value.converter.schemas.enable\": false,    \"database\": \"Tutorial2\",    \"collection\": \"pets\"  }}  \nNOTE The highlighted lines in the configuration properties specify converters which instruct the connector how to translate the data from Kafka. Run the following command in the shell to start the sink connector using the configuration file you created: cx simplesink.json  \nNOTE The cx command is a custom script included in the tutorial development environment. This script runs the following equivalent request to the Kafka Connect REST API to create a new connector: curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @simplesink.json http://connect:8083/connectors -w \"\\n\"  Run the following command in the shell to check the status of the connectors: status  If your sink connector started successfully, you should see the

The \"mongo-kafka-base\" image creates a Docker container that includes all the services you need in the tutorial and runs them on a shared network called \"mongodb-kafka-base_localnet\" as shown in the following diagram:  When the command completes successfully, it outputs the following text: ...Creating zookeeper ... doneCreating broker    ... doneCreating schema-registry ... doneCreating connect         ... doneCreating rest-proxy      ... doneCreating mongo1          ... doneCreating mongo1-setup    ... done 3 \nVERIFY THE SUCCESSFUL SETUP \nConfirm the development environment started normally by running the following commands: docker exec mongo1 status  This command should output the following information if the Docker development environment was set up successfully: Kafka topics:\n    \"topic\": \"docker-connect-status\",    \"topic\": \"docker-connect-offsets\",    \"topic\": \"docker-connect-configs\",    \"topic\": \"__consumer_offsets\",\nThe status of the connectors: Currently configured connectors\n[] Version of MongoDB Connector for Apache Kafka installed:\n{\"class\":\"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSinkConnector\",\"type\":\"sink\",\"version\":\"1.8.0\"}{\"class\":\"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector\",\"type\":\"source\",\"version\":\"1.8.0\"} Since you have not started the connectors, the status and configured list are empty. Your development environment setup is complete and you can proceed to the next step of the tutorial. \nTIP \nCONNECT TO DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT MONGODB You can connect to the MongoDB server running in

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nEXPLORE MONGODB CHANGE STREAMS \nOn this page    \n * Explore Change Streams\n   \n * Summary\n * Learn More Follow this tutorial to learn how to create a change stream on a MongoDB collection and observe the change events it creates. \nEXPLORE CHANGE STREAMS \n1 \nCOMPLETE THE TUTORIAL SETUP \nComplete the steps in the Kafka Connector Tutorial Setup to start the the Confluent Kafka Connect and MongoDB environment. 2 \nCONNECT TO THE DOCKER CONTAINER \nCreate two interactive shell sessions on the tutorial Docker Container, each in a separate window. Run the following command from a terminal to start an interactive shell. docker exec -it mongo1 /bin/bash  We will refer to this interactive shell as ChangeStreamShell1 throughout this tutorial. Run the following command in a second terminal to start an interactive shell: docker exec -it mongo1 /bin/bash  We will refer to this interactive shell as ChangeStreamShell2 throughout this tutorial. 3 \nOPEN A CHANGE STREAM \nIn ChangeStreamShell1, create a Python script to open a change stream using the PyMongo driver. nano openchangestream.py  Paste the following code into the file and save the changes: import pymongofrom bson.json_util import dumps\nclient = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb://mongo1')db = client.get_database(name='Tutorial1')with db.orders.watch() as stream:    print('\\nA change stream is open on the Tutorial1.orders namespace.  Currently watching ...\\n\\n')    for change in stream:        print(dumps(change, indent = 2))  Run the Python script: python3 openchangestream.py  The script outputs the following message after it starts successfully: Change Stream is opened on the Tutorial1.orders namespace.  Currently watching ... 4 \nTRIGGER A CHANGE EVENT \nIn ChangeStreamShell2, connect to MongoDB using mongosh, the MongoDB shell, using the following command: mongosh \"mongodb://mongo1\"  After you connect successfully, you should see the following MongoDB shell prompt: rs0 [direct: primary] test> At the prompt, type the following commands: use Tutorial1db.orders.insertOne( { 'test' : 1 } )  After entering the preceding commands, switch to ChangeStreamShell1 to view the change stream output, which should resemble the following: {  \"_id\": {    \"_data\": \"826264...\"  },  \"operationType\": \"insert\",  \"clusterTime\": {    \"$timestamp\": {      \"t\": 1650754657,      \"i\": 1    }  },  \"wallTime\": {    \"$date\": \"2022-10-13T17:06:23.409Z\"  },  \"fullDocument\": {    \"_id\": {      \"$oid\": \"<_id value of document>\"    },    \"test\": 1  },  \"ns\": {    \"db\": \"Tutorial1\",    \"coll\": \"orders\"  },  \"documentKey\": {    \"_id\": {      \"$oid\": \"<_id value of document>\"    }  }}  To stop the script, press Ctrl+C. By the end of this step, you've successfully triggered and observed a change stream event. 5 \nOPEN A FILTERED CHANGE STREAM \nYou can apply a filter to a change stream by passing it an aggregation pipeline.

 Run the Python script: python3 pipeline.py  The script outputs the following message after it starts successfully: Change Stream is opened on the Tutorial1.sensors namespace.  Currently watching for values > 100... 6 \nOBSERVE THE FILTERED CHANGE STREAM \nReturn to your ChangeStreamShell2 session which should be connected to MongoDB using mongosh. At the prompt, type the following commands: use Tutorial1db.sensors.insertOne( { 'type' : 'temp', 'value':101 } )  As indicated by the script output, the change stream creates a change event because it matches the following pipeline: [ { \"$match\": { \"$and\": [ { \"fullDocument.type\": \"temp\" }, { \"fullDocument.value\": { \"$gte\": 100 } } ] } } ] Try inserting the following documents in in ChangeStreamShell2 to verify the change stream only produces events when the documents match the filter: db.sensors.insertOne( { 'type' : 'temp', 'value': 99 } )db.sensors.insertOne( { 'type' : 'pressure', 'value': 22 } ) \n7 \n(OPTIONAL) STOP THE DOCKER CONTAINERS \nAfter you complete this tutorial, free resources on your computer by stopping or removing Docker assets. You can choose to remove both the Docker containers and images, or exclusively the containers. If you remove the containers and images, you must download them again to restart your MongoDB Kafka Connector development environment, which is approximately 2.4 GB in size. If you exclusively remove the containers, you can reuse the images and avoid downloading most of the large files in the sample data pipeline. \nTIP \nMORE TUTORIALS If you plan to complete any more MongoDB Kafka Connector tutorials, consider removing only containers. If you don't plan to complete any more MongoDB Kafka Connector tutorials, consider removing containers and images. Select the tab that corresponds to the removal task you want to run.  \nTo restart the containers, follow the same steps required to start them in the Tutorial Setup. \nSUMMARY \nIn this tutorial, you created a change stream on MongoDB and observed the output. The MongoDB Kafka source connector reads the change events from a change stream that you configure, and writes them to a Kafka topic. To learn how to configure a change stream and Kafka topic for a source connector, proceed to the Getting Started with the MongoDB Kafka Source Connector tutorial. \nLEARN MORE \nRead the following

Docs Home → MongoDB Kafka Connector \nGETTING STARTED WITH THE MONGODB KAFKA SOURCE CONNECTOR \nOn this page    \n * Get Started with the MongoDB Kafka Source Connector\n   \n * Summary\n * Learn More Follow this tutorial to learn how to configure a MongoDB Kafka source connector to read data from a change stream and publish it to an Apache Kafka topic. \nGET STARTED WITH THE MONGODB KAFKA SOURCE CONNECTOR \n1 \nCOMPLETE THE TUTORIAL SETUP \nComplete the steps in the Kafka Connector Tutorial Setup to start the the Confluent Kafka Connect and MongoDB environment. 2 \nCONFIGURE THE SOURCE CONNECTOR \nCreate an interactive shell session on the tutorial Docker container downloaded for the Tutorial Setup using the following command: docker exec -it mongo1 /bin/bash  Create a source configuration file called simplesource.json with the following command: nano simplesource.json  Paste the following configuration information into the file and save your changes: {  \"name\": \"mongo-simple-source\",  \"config\": {    \"connector.class\": \"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector\",    \"connection.uri\": \"mongodb://mongo1\",    \"database\": \"Tutorial1\",    \"collection\": \"orders\"  }}  Run the following command in the shell to start the source connector using the configuration file you created: cx simplesource.json  \nNOTE The cx command is a custom script included in the tutorial development environment. This script runs the following equivalent request to the Kafka Connect REST API to create a new connector: curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @simplesource.json http://connect:8083/connectors -w \"\\n\"  Run the following command in the shell to check the status of the connectors: status  If your source connector started successfully, you should see the following output: Kafka topics:...\nThe status of the connectors:\nsource  |  mongo-simple-source  |  RUNNING  |  RUNNING  |  com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector\nCurrently configured connectors\n[  \"mongo-simple-source\"]... 3 \nCREATE CHANGE EVENTS \nIn the same shell, connect to MongoDB using mongosh, the MongoDB shell by running the following command: mongosh \"mongodb://mongo1\"  After you connect successfully, you should see the following MongoDB shell prompt: rs0 [direct: primary] test> At the prompt, type the following commands to insert a new document: use Tutorial1db.orders.insertOne( { 'order_id' : 1, 'item' : 'coffee' } )  Once MongoDB completes the insert command, you should receive an acknowledgment that resembles the following text: {  acknowledged: true,  insertedId: ObjectId(\"627e7e...\")} Exit the MongoDB shell by entering the command exit. Check the status of your Kafka environment using the following command: status  In the output of the preceding command, you should see the new topic that the source connector created after receiving the change event: ...\"topic\": \"Tutorial1.orders\",... Confirm the content of data on the new Kafka topic by running the following command: kc Tutorial1.orders  \nNOTE The kc command is a helper script that outputs the content of a Kafka topic. You should see the following Kafka topic data, organized by \"Key\" and \"Value\" sections when you run the preceding command: From the \"Value\" section of the output, you can find the part of the

4 \nRECONFIGURE THE CHANGE STREAM \nYou can omit the metadata from the events created by the change stream by configuring it to only return the fullDocument field. Stop the connector using the following command: del mongo-simple-source  \nNOTE The del command is a helper script that calls the Kafka Connect REST API to stop the connector and is equivalent to the following command: curl -X DELETE connect:8083/connectors/<parameter>  Edit the source configuration file called simplesource.json with the following command: nano simplesource.json  Remove the existing configuration, add the following configuration, and save the file: {  \"name\": \"mongo-simple-source\",  \"config\": {    \"connector.class\": \"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector\",    \"connection.uri\": \"mongodb://mongo1\",    \"publish.full.document.only\": true,    \"database\": \"Tutorial1\",    \"collection\": \"orders\"  }}  Run the following command in the shell to start the source connector using the configuration file you updated: cx simplesource.json  Connect to MongoDB using mongosh using the following command: mongosh \"mongodb://mongo1\"  At the prompt, type the following commands to insert a new document: use Tutorial1db.orders.insertOne( { 'order_id' : 2, 'item' : 'oatmeal' } )  Exit mongosh by running the following command: exit  Confirm the content of data on the new Kafka topic by running the following command: kc Tutorial1.orders  The payload field in the \"Value\" document should contain only the following document data: { \"_id\": { \"$oid\": \"<your _id value>\" }, \"order_id\": 2, \"item\": \"oatmeal\" } 5 \n(OPTIONAL) STOP THE DOCKER CONTAINERS \nAfter you complete this tutorial, free resources on your computer by stopping or removing Docker assets. You can choose to remove both the Docker containers and images, or exclusively the containers. If you remove the containers and images, you must download them again to restart your MongoDB Kafka Connector development environment, which is approximately 2.4 GB in size. If you exclusively remove the containers, you can reuse the images and avoid downloading most of the large files in the sample data pipeline. \nTIP \nMORE TUTORIALS If you plan to complete any more MongoDB Kafka Connector tutorials, consider removing only containers. If you don't plan to complete any more MongoDB Kafka Connector tutorials, consider removing containers and images.

Projection Wildcard Pattern Matching Examples\n * Field Renaming Examples\n * How to Create a Custom Post Processor \nOVERVIEW \nOn this page, you can learn how to configure post processors in your MongoDB Kafka sink connector. Post processors modify sink records that the connector reads from a Kafka topic before the connector stores it in your MongoDB collection. A few examples of data modifications post processors can make include:      * Set the document _id field to a custom value  * Include or exclude message key or value fields  * Rename fields You can use the prebuilt post processors included in the connector or implement your own. See the following sections for more information on post processors:  * How Post Processors Modify Data  * How to Specify Post Processors  * Prebuilt Post Processors  * Configure the Document Id Adder Post Processor  * Post Processor Configuration Examples  * Create a Custom Post Processor \nHOW POST PROCESSORS MODIFY DATA \nPost processors modify data read from a Kafka topic. The connector stores the message in a SinkDocument class which contains a representation of the Kafka SinkRecord key and value fields. The connector sequentially applies any post processors specified in the configuration and stores the result in a MongoDB collection. Post processors perform data modification tasks such as generating the document _id field, projecting message key or value fields, and renaming fields. You can use the prebuilt post processors included in the connector, or you can implement your own by extending the PostProcessor class. \nIMPORTANT \nPOST PROCESSORS AND CHANGE DATA CAPTURE (CDC) HANDLERS You cannot apply a post processor to CDC handler event data. If you specify both, the connector logs a warning. \nHOW TO SPECIFY POST PROCESSORS \nYou can specify one or more post processors in the post.processor.chain configuration setting as a comma-separated list. If you specify more than one, the connector applies them sequentially in which each post processor modifies the data output by the prior one. To ensure the documents the connector writes to MongoDB contain unique _id fields, it automatically adds the DocumentIdAdder post processor in the first position of the chain if you do not otherwise include it. The following example setting specifies that the connector should run the KafkaMetaAdder post processor first and then the AllowListValueProjector post processor on the output. post.processor.chain=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.KafkaMetaAdder,com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.AllowListValueProjector  \nPREBUILT POST PROCESSORS \nThe following table contains a list of all the post processors included in the sink connector. Post Processor Name\nDescription\nDocumentIdAdder\nFull Path: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.DocumentIdAdder \nInserts an _id field determined by the configured strategy.\nThe default strategy is BsonOidStrategy.\nFor information on strategy options and configuration, see the Configure the Document Id Adder Post Processor section.\nBlockListKeyProjector\nFull Path: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.BlockListKeyProjector \nRemoves matching key fields from the sink record.\nFor more information on configuration, see the Allow List and Block List Examples.\nBlockListValueProjector\nFull Path: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.BlockListValueProjector \nRemoves matching value fields from the sink record.\nFor more information on configuration, see the Allow List and Block List Examples.\nAllowListKeyProjector\nFull Path: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.AllowListKeyProjector \nIncludes only matching key fields from the sink record.\nFor more information on configuration, see the Allow List and Block List Examples.\nAllowListValueProjector\nFull Path:

You can specify a strategy for this post processor in the document.id.strategy setting as shown in the following example: document.id.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.UuidStrategy  The following table shows a list of the strategies you can use to configure the DocumentIdAdder post processor: Strategy Name\nDescription\nBsonOidStrategy\nFull Path: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.BsonOidStrategy \nGenerates a MongoDB BSON ObjectId.\nDefault strategy for the DocumentIdAdder post processor.\nKafkaMetaDataStrategy\nFull Path: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.KafkaMetaDataStrategy \nBuilds a string composed of the concatenation of Kafka topic, partition, and offset.\nFullKeyStrategy\nFull Path: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.FullKeyStrategy \nUses the complete key structure of the sink document to generate the value for the _id field.\nDefaults to a blank document if no key exists.\nProvidedInKeyStrategy\nFull Path: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.ProvidedInKeyStrategy \nUses the _id field specified in the key structure of the sink document.\nThrows an exception if the field is missing from the sink document.\nProvidedInValueStrategy\nFull Path: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.ProvidedInValueStrategy \nUses the _id field specified in the value structure of the sink document.\nThrows an exception if the field is missing from the sink document.\nPartialKeyStrategy\nFull Path: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.PartialKeyStrategy \nUses a block list or allow list projection of the sink document key structure.\nDefaults to a blank document if no key exists.\nPartialValueStrategy\nFull Path: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.PartialValueStrategy \nUses a block list or allow list projection of the sink document value structure.\nDefaults to a blank document if no value exists.\nUuidProvidedInKeyStrategy\nFull Path: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.UuidInKeyStrategy \nConverts the _id key field to a UUID. The value must be either a string or binary type and must conform to the UUID format.\nUuidProvidedInValueStrategy\nFull Path: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.UuidInValueStrategy \nConverts the _id value field to a UUID. The value must be either a string or binary type and must conform to the UUID format.\nUuidStrategy\nFull Path: com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.UuidStrategy`` \nUses a randomly generated UUID in string format.

 1. Create a Java class that implements the interface IdStrategy and contains your custom configuration logic.  2. Compile the class to a JAR file.  3. Add the compiled JAR to the class path / plugin path for all your Kafka workers. For more information about plugin paths, see the Confluent documentation.  4. Update the document.id.strategy setting to the full class name of your custom class in all your Kafka workers. \nNOTE \nSELECTED STRATEGY MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS ON DELIVERY SEMANTICS BSON ObjectId or UUID strategies can only guarantee at-least-once delivery since the connector generates new ids on retries or when processing records again. Other strategies permit exactly-once delivery if you can guarantee the fields that form the document id are unique. For example implementations of the IdStrategy interface, see the source code directory that contains id strategy implementations packaged with the connector. \nPOST PROCESSOR EXAMPLES \nThis section shows examples of configuration and sample output of the following types of post processors:  * Allow List and Block List  * Projection Wildcard Pattern Matching  * Field Renaming \nALLOW LIST AND BLOCK LIST EXAMPLES \nThe allow list and block list projector post processors determine which fields to include and exclude from the output. When you use the allow list projector, the post processor only outputs data from the fields that you specify. When you use the block list projector, the post process only omits data from the fields that you specify. \nNOTE You can use the \".\" (dot) notation to reference nested fields in the record. You can also use the notation to reference fields of documents in an array. When you add a projector to your post processor chain, you must specify the projector type and whether to apply it to the key or value portion of the sink document. See the following sections for example projector configurations and output. \nALLOW LIST PROJECTOR EXAMPLE \nSuppose your Kafka record value documents resembled the following user profile data: {  \"name\": \"Sally Kimball\",  \"age\": 10,  \"address\": {    \"city\": \"Idaville\",    \"country\": \"USA\"  },  \"hobbies\": [    \"reading\",    \"solving crime\"  ]} You can configure the AllowList value projector to store select data such as the \"name\", \"address.city\", and \"hobbies\" fields from your value documents using the following settings: post.processor.chain=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.AllowListValueProjectorvalue.projection.type=AllowListvalue.projection.list=name,address.city,hobbies  After the post processor applies the projection, it outputs the following record: {  \"name\": \"Sally Kimball\",  \"address\": {    \"city\": \"Idaville\"  },  \"hobbies\": [    \"reading\",    \"solving crime\"  ]} \nBLOCK LIST PROJECTOR EXAMPLE \nSuppose your Kafka record key documents resembled the following user identification data: {  \"username\": \"user5983\",  \"registration\": {    \"date\": \"2021-09-13\",    \"source\": \"mobile\"  },  \"authToken\": {    \"alg\": \"HS256\",    \"type\": \"JWT\",    \"payload\": \"zI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODk\"  }} You can configure the BlockList key projector to omit the \"authToken\" and \"registration.source\" fields before storing the data with the following settings: post.processor.chain=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.BlockListKeyProjectorkey.projection.type=BlockListkey.projection.list=authToken,registration.source  After the post processor applies the projection, it outputs the following record: {  \"username\": \"user5983\",  \"registration\": {    \"date\": \"2021-09-13\",  }} \nPROJECTION WILDCARD PATTERN MATCHING EXAMPLES \nThis section shows how you can configure the projector post processors to match wildcard patterns to match field names.

The following wildcard matching example projects any document that contains the field named \"low\". post.processor.chain=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.AllowListValueProjectorvalue.projection.type=AllowListvalue.projection.list=**.low  The post processor that applies the projection outputs the following record: {  \"temperature\": {    \"high\": 28,    \"low\": 24,    \"units\": \"C\"  },  \"soil_conditions\": {    \"temperature\": {      \"high\": 22,      \"low\": 17,      \"units\": \"C\"    }  }} BLOCK LIST WILDCARD EXAMPLE \nYou can use the wildcard patterns to match fields at a specific document level as shown in the following block list configuration example: post.processor.chain=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.BlockListValueProjectorvalue.projection.type=BlockListvalue.projection.list=*.*.temperature  {  \"city\": \"Springfield\",  \"temperature\": {    \"high\": 28,    \"low\": 24,    \"units\": \"C\"  },  \"wind_speed_10m\": {    \"average\": 3,    \"units\": \"km/h\"  },  \"wind_speed_80m\": {    \"average\": 8,    \"units\": \"km/h\"  },  \"soil_conditions\": {    \"moisture\": {      \"average\": 340,      \"units\": \"mm\"    }  }} \nFIELD RENAMING EXAMPLES \nThis section shows how you can configure the RenameByMapping and RenameByRegex field renamer post processors to update field names in a sink record. The field renaming settings specify the following:  * Whether to update the key or value document in the record  * The field names to update  * The new field names You must specify RenameByMapping and RenameByRegex settings in a JSON array. You can specify nested fields by using either dot notation or pattern matching. The field renamer post processor examples use the following example sink record: Key Document {  \"location\": \"Provence\",  \"date_month\": \"October\",  \"date_day\": 17} Value Document {

Key Name\nDescription\noldName\nSpecifies whether to match fields in the key or value document and the field name to replace. The setting uses a \".\" character to separate the two values.\nnewName\nSpecifies the replacement field name for all matches of the field. The following example property matches the \"location\" field of a key document and renames it to \"country\": field.renamer.mapping=[{\"oldName\":\"key.location\", \"newName\":\"country\"}]  This setting instructs the RenameByMapping post processor to transform the original key document to the following document: {  \"country\": \"Provence\",  \"date_month\": \"October\",  \"date_day\": 17} You can perform a similar field name assignment for value documents by specifying the value document with the appended field name in the oldName field as follows: field.renamer.mapping=[{\"oldName\":\"value.flapjacks\", \"newName\":\"crepes\"}]  This setting instructs the RenameByMapping post processor to transform the original value document to the following document: {  \"crepes\": {    \"purchased\": 598,    \"size\": \"large\"  }} You can also specify one or more mappings in the field.renamer.mapping property by using a JSON array in string format as shown in the following setting: field.renamer.mapping=[{ \"oldName\":\"key.location\", \"newName\":\"city\" }, { \"oldName\":\"value.crepes\", \"newName\":\"flapjacks\" }]  RENAME BY REGULAR EXPRESSION \nThe RenameByRegex post processor setting specifies the field names and text patterns that it should match, and replacement values for the matched text. You can specify one or more renaming expressions in JSON objects containing the fields described in the following table: Key Name\nDescription\nregexp\nContains a regular expression that matches fields to perform the replacement.\npattern\nContains a regular expression that matches on the text to replace.\nreplace\nContains the replacement text for all matches of the regular expression you defined in the pattern field. The following example setting instructs the post processor to perform the following:  * Match any field names in the key document that start with \"date\". In the set of matching fields, replace all text that matches the pattern _ with the - character.  * Match any field names in the value document that are subdocuments of crepes. In the set of matching fields, replace all text that matches the pattern purchased with quantity. field.renamer.regexp=[{\"regexp\":\"^key\\\\.date.*$\",\"pattern\":\"_\",\"replace\":\"-\"}, {\"regexp\":\"^value\\\\.crepes\\\\..*\",\"pattern\":\"purchased\",\"replace\":\"quantity\"}]  When the connector applies the post processor to the example key document and the example value document, it outputs the following: Key Document {  \"location\": \"Provence\",  \"date-month\": \"October\",  \"date-day\": 17} Value Document {  \"crepes\": {    \"quantity\": 598,    \"size\": \"large\"  }} \nWARNING \nTHE RENAMER POST PROCESSORS DO NOT OVERWRITE EXISTING FIELD NAMES The target field names you set in your renamer post processors to may result in duplicate field names in the same document. To avoid this, the post processor skips renaming when it would duplicate an existing field name at the same level of the document. \nHOW TO CREATE A CUSTOM POST PROCESSOR \nIf the built-in post processors do not cover your use case, you can create a custom post processor class using the following steps:  1. Create a Java class that extends the PostProcessor abstract class.  2. Override the process() method in your class. You can update the SinkDocument, a BSON representation of the sink record key and value fields, and access the original Kafka SinkRecord in your method.  3. Compile the class to a JAR file.  4. Add the compiled JAR to the class path / plugin path for all your Kafka workers. For more information about plugin paths, see the Confluent documentation on Manually Installing Community Connectors.  5. Add your post processor full class name to the post processor chain configuration.
