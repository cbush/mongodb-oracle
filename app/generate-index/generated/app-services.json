Atlas App Services automatically creates GraphQL types for every linked collection that has a defined schema and evaluates role-based permissions for all GraphQL requests. To learn how to make data available through the GraphQL API, see Expose Data in a Collection. To learn about the generated types and operations that you can use with the Atlas GraphQL API, see GraphQL Types & Resolvers. To extend the generated GraphQL API's functionality with custom queries and mutations, see Define a Custom Resolver. \nNOTE \nCREATE AN ATLAS CLUSTER FOR FREE The GraphQL API lets you access data that you have stored in a MongoDB Atlas cluster or Federated database instance. To get started, create a free cluster and link it to your App. If you don't have any data yet but you still want to explore the GraphQL API, consider adding a sample data set to your cluster. \nWHY GRAPHQL? \nGraphQL is a declarative, strongly-typed query language for client applications. Clients define the exact data shape and contents that they need in a single request which eliminates over-fetching problems and circumvents the need for multiple costly round trips to the server. To learn more about GraphQL, check out the official GraphQL tutorial. \nHOW APP SERVICES CREATES GRAPHQL SCHEMAS \nUsing App Services, you generate the GraphQL schema and resolvers from JSON schemas for MongoDB collections. This differs from the traditional code-first and schema-first approaches to GraphQL schema development. To define your GraphQL schema with App Services:       1. Define a JSON schema for a MongoDB collection in your MongoDB Atlas cluster. You can enforce the shape of the collection schema based on custom definitions or use a generated schema based on the documents in the collection.  2. Generate the GraphQL schema and resolvers based on your collection JSON schema.  3. Optionally extend the functionality of your generated GraphQL schema with custom resolvers. \nGRAPHQL OPERATIONS \nApp Services automatically generates types and resolvers for data that you expose to the GraphQL API. The generated types and operations are all named after the base type name for each exposed collection. If you don't define a type name, App Services uses the collection name instead. For more information on how to expose a collection and name its data type, see Expose Data in a Collection. \nNOTE GraphQL mutation and custom resolver requests use MongoDB transactions to ensure correctness across multiple database operations. If any operation in a request fails, then the entire transaction fails and no operations are committed to the database. \nQUERIES \nA GraphQL query is a read operation that requests specific fields from one or more types. App Services automatically generates query types for documents in each collection that has a defined schema. For more information and examples, including a list of all automatically generated query types, see Query Resolvers. # Find a single movie by namequery {  movie(query: { title: \"The Matrix\" }) {    _id    title    year    runtime  }}\n# Find all movies from the year 2000query {  movies(query: { year: 2000 }) {    _id    title    year    runtime  }}\n# Find the ten longest movies from the year 2000query {  movies(    query: { year: 2000 }    sortBy: RUNTIME_DESC    limit: 10  ) {    _id    title    year    runtime  }}  \nMUTATIONS \nA GraphQL mutation is a write operation that creates, modifies, or deletes one or more documents. App Services automatically generates mutation types for documents in each collection that has a defined schema. App Services uses transactions to ensure safe writes via mutations.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nREALM CLI \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Installation\n * Authentication\n * Generate an API Key\n * Authenticate with an API Key\n * Options\n * Commands \nOVERVIEW \nThe Atlas App Services Command Line Interface (realm-cli) allows you to programmatically manage your App Services Apps. With realm-cli, you can create or update Apps from a local directory as well as export existing applications to a local directory. \nIMPORTANT \nCHECK YOUR CLI VERSION This page is a quickstart for version 2 of realm-cli. If you need documentation for version 1 of realm-cli, see: Realm CLI v1. To check your CLI version, use: realm-cli --version. To upgrade your global install to the latest version, use: npm upgrade -g mongodb-realm-cli. \nINSTALLATION \nRealm CLI is available on npm. To install version 2 of the Realm CLI on your system, ensure that you have Node.js installed and then run the following command in your shell: npm install -g mongodb-realm-cli  \nAUTHENTICATION \nTo use the Realm CLI, you must authenticate. To authenticate, you must generate an API Key. \nGENERATE AN API KEY \n1 NAVIGATE TO MONGODB CLOUD ACCESS MANAGER \nThe MongoDB Cloud Access Manager allows you to manage access to your project for users, teams, and API Keys. Use the Project Access Manager by clicking the Project Access tab on the access manager dropdown on your screen's top left-hand side. click to enlarge\n2 CREATE AN API KEY \nProject Users can log in using the Realm CLI tool with a Project API Key. Create a project API Key by clicking the grey Create API Key button on the right-hand side of the Project Access Manager. click to enlarge Clicking this button navigates you to the \"Create API Key\" screen. Set a description for your key. For write access, the CLI requires an API key with \"Project Owner\" permissions. For read-only access, you can use \"Project Read Only\". Use the Project Permissions dropdown to select the appropriate permissions for your use case. Copy the public key to use later in order to log in. Click next to continue configuring your key details. click to enlarge\n3 CONFIGURE YOUR API ACCESS LIST \nCopy your Private Key to a safe location for later use. For security, the Private Key will not be visible again after initialization. Another security feature is the API Access List.

Identities\n * Active User\n * System User\n * User Sessions\n * Summary \nINTRODUCTION \nAtlas App Services manages authentication for your application's end users. App Services:      * Uses role-based data access rules to determine read & write permissions.  * Associates every request with an authenticated user  * Evaluates permissions for every object included the request. Through user accounts, you can store and access metadata and custom data for each user. Users log in through authentication providers. Each provider represents a specific method of authentication. App Services includes built-in providers for common use cases, such as Facebook and Google. Custom providers allow you to integrate any external authentication system. \nCONCEPTS  AUTHENTICATION PROVIDERS \nIn App Services, an authentication provider is a modular service. These services provide identity verification, and maintain information about app users. Users authenticate themselves by providing a set of credentials to an authentication provider. With valid credentials, the provider returns a unique identity associated with the user. App Services logs them in as the active user. App Services includes built-in authentication providers for common use cases. This includes:  * Anonymous users  * Email/password combinations  * API keys  * OAuth 2.0 through Facebook, Google, and Apple ID You can configure custom providers to integrate external authentication systems.  * Custom JWT: provider accepts JSON web tokens signed by the external system.  * Custom Function: provider allows you to define custom login logic in an Atlas Function. \nIMPORTANT \nAPPS REQUIRE USER AUTHENTICATION Every application must have at least one authentication provider configured and enabled. Without at least one provider, no client application can connect. To learn how to configure and enable authentication providers, see: Authentication Providers. \nUSER ACCOUNTS \nA user account represents a single, distinct user of your application. App Services creates the user when an authentication provider validates a unique identity. You can source user metadata, such as email or birthday, from authentication providers. You can associate each user with custom data. \nTIP \nAPPLE ACCOUNT DELETION REQUIREMENTS Apple requires that applications distributed through the App Store must give any user who creates an account the option to delete the account. Whether that app uses an authentication method where you must manually register a user, such as email/password authentication, or one that automatically creates a user, such as Sign-In with Apple, an app distributed through the App Store must implement user account deletion. \nAUTHENTICATION PROVIDER IDENTITIES \nApp Services stores login metadata for a user in an authentication provider identity. App Services uses this metadata to authenticate the user. Upon first login with an authentication provider, App Services creates an identity object. Each object contains a unique ID, and provider-specific metadata about the user. On later logins, App Services refreshes the existing identity data. A single user account can have more than one identity. Realm SDKs enable you to link identities to existing user accounts. This allows users to log in to a single account with more than one provider. For more information, see the documentation on linking identities for your client SDK. \nACTIVE USER \nIn the Realm SDKs, you can log in more than one user, but only one account can be active at any given time. The active user is a user account associated with an application request. App Services executes requests from client applications as the active user. App Services replaces dynamic references to the user - e.g. %%user in a JSON expression - with the active user. You can use a specific active user, or the system user, to execute Functions. \nSYSTEM USER \nThe system user is an internal user that has advanced privileges. The system user bypasses all rules. You can execute functions as a system user instead of the user making a request. Triggers run in the context of the system user. The system user is useful for administrative tasks. This includes:  * Tasks that need to circumvent rules and queries  * Tasks that need unrestricted access to MongoDB CRUD and aggregation operations \nIMPORTANT \nSECURITY WARNING Rules do not apply to the system user. Functions run as the system user can become a security liability. Ensure that you do not expose these functions to unauthorized users. For example, use function context to check if the active user can call the system function.

Identities\n * Active User\n * System User\n * User Sessions\n * Summary \nINTRODUCTION \nAtlas App Services manages authentication for your application's end users. App Services:      * Uses role-based data access rules to determine read & write permissions.  * Associates every request with an authenticated user  * Evaluates permissions for every object included the request. Through user accounts, you can store and access metadata and custom data for each user. Users log in through authentication providers. Each provider represents a specific method of authentication. App Services includes built-in providers for common use cases, such as Facebook and Google. Custom providers allow you to integrate any external authentication system. \nCONCEPTS  AUTHENTICATION PROVIDERS \nIn App Services, an authentication provider is a modular service. These services provide identity verification, and maintain information about app users. Users authenticate themselves by providing a set of credentials to an authentication provider. With valid credentials, the provider returns a unique identity associated with the user. App Services logs them in as the active user. App Services includes built-in authentication providers for common use cases. This includes:  * Anonymous users  * Email/password combinations  * API keys  * OAuth 2.0 through Facebook, Google, and Apple ID You can configure custom providers to integrate external authentication systems.  * Custom JWT: provider accepts JSON web tokens signed by the external system.  * Custom Function: provider allows you to define custom login logic in an Atlas Function. \nIMPORTANT \nAPPS REQUIRE USER AUTHENTICATION Every application must have at least one authentication provider configured and enabled. Without at least one provider, no client application can connect. To learn how to configure and enable authentication providers, see: Authentication Providers. \nUSER ACCOUNTS \nA user account represents a single, distinct user of your application. App Services creates the user when an authentication provider validates a unique identity. You can source user metadata, such as email or birthday, from authentication providers. You can associate each user with custom data. \nTIP \nAPPLE ACCOUNT DELETION REQUIREMENTS Apple requires that applications distributed through the App Store must give any user who creates an account the option to delete the account. Whether that app uses an authentication method where you must manually register a user, such as email/password authentication, or one that automatically creates a user, such as Sign-In with Apple, an app distributed through the App Store must implement user account deletion. \nAUTHENTICATION PROVIDER IDENTITIES \nApp Services stores login metadata for a user in an authentication provider identity. App Services uses this metadata to authenticate the user. Upon first login with an authentication provider, App Services creates an identity object. Each object contains a unique ID, and provider-specific metadata about the user. On later logins, App Services refreshes the existing identity data. A single user account can have more than one identity. Realm SDKs enable you to link identities to existing user accounts. This allows users to log in to a single account with more than one provider. For more information, see the documentation on linking identities for your client SDK. \nACTIVE USER \nIn the Realm SDKs, you can log in more than one user, but only one account can be active at any given time. The active user is a user account associated with an application request. App Services executes requests from client applications as the active user. App Services replaces dynamic references to the user - e.g. %%user in a JSON expression - with the active user. You can use a specific active user, or the system user, to execute Functions. \nSYSTEM USER \nThe system user is an internal user that has advanced privileges. The system user bypasses all rules. You can execute functions as a system user instead of the user making a request. Triggers run in the context of the system user. The system user is useful for administrative tasks. This includes:  * Tasks that need to circumvent rules and queries  * Tasks that need unrestricted access to MongoDB CRUD and aggregation operations \nIMPORTANT \nSECURITY WARNING Rules do not apply to the system user. Functions run as the system user can become a security liability. Ensure that you do not expose these functions to unauthorized users. For example, use function context to check if the active user can call the system function.

Management\n * Schema Validation and Data Access Rules\n * Event-Driven Serverless Functions\n * Secure Client-Side Queries\n * Synchronize Data Across Devices\n * Get Started with App Services\n * Prebuilt Applications\n * Tutorials\n * Summary As a backend developer, you can use Atlas App Services to rapidly develop cloud-based applications. App Services Apps can react to changes in your MongoDB Atlas data, connect that data to other systems, and scale to meet demand. App Services does this without the need to manage database and server infrastructure. As a web developer, you have to deal with lots of overhead when sending data from a server to the browser. This includes things like authentication and data validation. And then the application has to be scalable and secure. Many libraries and frameworks exist to provide these services. Selecting the best ones for your project requires deep understanding of the tradeoffs. As a mobile app developer, syncing data across devices poses challenges. You might write a lot of custom conflict resolution code yourself, or you might use a platform-specific backend like CloudKit that's not designed for developing cross-platform applications. Atlas Device Sync provides an offline-first, cross-platform solution for syncing data between a backend and mobile devices. When you combine this with App Services's authentication and data validation, you solve a host of common mobile app development issues. App Services is a serverless application backend that streamlines solving these common challenges. App Services provides configurable functions, integrated data access, and security rules. With App Services, you can focus on building unique features instead of boilerplate backend code. \nWHAT PROBLEM DOES APP SERVICES SOLVE? \nIt takes time, resources, and expertise to build, administer, and maintain backend infrastructure. However, a lot of these features are similar across applications. App Services manages the backend infrastructure and user management for you. This frees you to focus on the features that makes your app special, not boilerplate code. App Services is: Serverless:\n     * Deploy server-side applications without having to set up and manage server infrastructure. App Services includes provisioning, deployment, operating systems, web servers, logging, backups, and redundancy.  * Run cloud-based Atlas Functions that can crunch data or interact with Node.js modules.  * Skip writing an authentication API on top of your App Services instance. Authenticated clients can interact with parts of the database based on their permissions. Dynamic and responsive:  * React to data changes in MongoDB Atlas, process data from HTTPS endpoints, or run Atlas Functions on a schedule with Atlas Triggers.  * Get up and running quickly for free, then scale according to the demands of your application.  * Pay for and receive only the exact amount of compute you need at any given time with usage-based pricing. Usage under a certain amount per month is always free. Simply secure:  * Let users log in with familiar authentication providers that are built into App Services.  * Control which users may read and write data on a per-field basis with role-based permissions that you can define declaratively or with a function.  * Enforce data integrity by defining validation logic. Synchronized:  * Seamlessly sync data across devices with Atlas Device Sync .  * Avoid writing complex synchronization logic with the Realm Database SDKs. \nUSER AUTHENTICATION AND MANAGEMENT \nSecure user authentication is essential for most apps. Some apps authenticate users with traditional email/password combinations. Others use API keys or third-party authentication providers like Facebook and Google. These methods often require a lot of complex boilerplate code. App Services provides built-in user management and authentication methods. These features encapsulate complexity and make it easy to integrate third-party authentication providers. You can enable authentication providers in your server-side configuration then immediately log in from any client application using a Realm SDK. To learn more about authentication in App Services, see Authenticate & Manage Users. \nSCHEMA VALIDATION AND DATA ACCESS RULES \nModern applications require that data is available using consistent types and formats. Data consistency guarantees that all the application's components can work together. It's also important to make sure that any given piece of data is only accessible to an authorized user. For example, you might grant a user access to only their own data. App Services validates data with a schema you define in the JSON schema standard. A schema serves as the source of truth for defining data types in your application.

To learn more about defining a schema and access rules for your data, see collection rules. \nEVENT-DRIVEN SERVERLESS FUNCTIONS \nMany applications require that some business logic runs on a server. Usually this logic deals with sensitive user data or interacting with external services. Apps might also need to respond in real time when something happens in the app or in an external service. App Services lets you define serverless JavaScript functions called Atlas Functions. You can use Atlas Functions for the following common backend use cases:  * Call from client applications with the Realm Web SDK.  * Execute Atlas Functions in response to trigger events, like an update to a document in MongoDB or at a scheduled time.  * HTTPS endpoints that execute a function in response to external applications. To learn more about defining and using serverless functions, see Atlas Functions and Atlas Triggers. \nSECURE CLIENT-SIDE QUERIES \nDevelopers need efficient, secure data access. If the data is on a server, you need an API to access the data and prevent unauthorized access. The Realm SDKs provide a secure MongoDB client to interact with data in your MongoDB data sources. App Services's server-side rules ensures that users only read and modify permitted documents. Rules consist of one or more user roles for each collection. A role determines if a given user has permission to access and edit a document. App Services determines a role for each document in every request. It then enforces the role's permissions before responding. GRAPHQL FOR MONGODB \nGraphQL is a standard, open-source API architecture that is an alternative to REST and other HTTP APIs. It features a query language that lets you access only the data you need. App Services generates a GraphQL API for your application based on your data model. The API includes a set of CRUD operations that you can access with a GraphQL client or in a HTTP request. You can also create custom resolvers backed by functions. To learn more about the Atlas GraphQL API, see Atlas GraphQL API. CLIENT-SIDE MONGODB QUERIES \nTraditionally developers query the database on the server and access the server from the client through a HTTP API. This requires more developer resources and lacks the flexibility of directly querying a database. App Services and the Realm SDKs include MongoDB Data Access, an API that lets you access MongoDB Atlas from the client using the Query API. You can query Atlas like you're using a database driver and App Services enforces data access rules for all requests. The following Realm SDKs let you query Atlas with MongoDB Data Access from client apps:  * Query MongoDB - Java SDK  * Query MongoDB - .NET SDK  * Query MongoDB - Node.js SDK  * Query MongoDB - React Native SDK  * Query MongoDB - Swift SDK  * Query MongoDB - Web SDK \nSYNCHRONIZE DATA ACROSS DEVICES \nSynchronizing data is a hard problem for mobile app developers. Device Sync provides offline-first sync capabilities for your mobile application. Client applications use Realm Database to persist data to the local device. When the device has a network connection, Sync seamlessly sends the data to the App. The app stores the data to a linked MongoDB Atlas data source, and updates the data on other client devices. Device Sync provides conflict resolution to handle multiple users updating the same data. When combined with user authentication and management and schema validation and data access, Device Sync provides a secure way for your mobile clients to sync data across devices and with the cloud. \nGET STARTED WITH APP SERVICES  PREBUILT APPLICATIONS \nTo explore a prebuilt app that you can customize, create a template app. Template applications are working apps that use App Services services to do things like:  * Use Sync to synchronize data between mobile clients and the linked MongoDB Atlas collection.  * Host a Todo web app using the GraphQL API  * Host a Todo web app using the Realm Web SDK  * Manage event-driven Database Triggers to update views in a separate collection Template apps are working apps you can run and change to experiment with App Services. These apps are a good choice for developers who prefer to learn by experimentation, versus the tutorials, which provide a deeper, step-by-step process for building apps. \nTUTORIALS \nCheck out our tutorials to learn more about how to build App Services Applications. Tutorials start with our Template Apps and and then walk you through building additional features powered by App Services, including Device Sync and Role-based Permissions. \nSUMMARY \n * App Services is a serverless application platform that makes it easy to deploy and scale.  * You can build an app with custom logic via functions and triggers, custom permissions via rules, and authentication via

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nATLAS DATA API \nOn this page    \n * Endpoints\n   \n * How the Data API Works\n * When to Use the Data API The Data API is a managed service that lets you securely work with data stored in Atlas using standard HTTPS requests. The Data API is not a direct connection to your database. Instead, the API is a fully-managed middleware service that sits between your cluster and the clients that send requests. You can use the Data API to connect to MongoDB Atlas from any platform that supports HTTPS, including:      * Web browsers  * Web servers  * CI/CD pipelines  * Serverless & Edge compute environments  * Mobile applications  * Internet-Of-Things devices You don't need to install any database drivers or opinionated libraries to work with the Data API. Instead, you send standard HTTPS requests like the following: curl -X POST \\  https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/myapp-abcde/endpoint/data/v1/action/insertOne \\  -H 'apiKey: <API Key>' \\  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\  -d '{    \"dataSource\": \"mongodb-atlas\",    \"database\": \"learn-data-api\",    \"collection\": \"hello\",    \"document\": {      \"text\": \"Hello, World!\",    }  }' HIDE OUTPUT { \"insertedId\": \"63dc56ac74ddb86ed3eb8474\" } \nENDPOINTS \nThe Data API supports two types of endpoints:  * Data API Endpoints are automatically generated endpoints that each represent a MongoDB operation. You can use the endpoints to create, read, update, delete, and aggregate documents in a MongoDB data source.\n   \n   To learn more, including how to set up and call endpoints, see Data API Endpoints.  * Custom Endpoints are app-specific API routes handled by Atlas Functions that you write. You can use custom endpoints to define operations that fit your use case specifically. For example, you could create an endpoint that runs a pre-defined aggregation or that integrates with an external webhook service.\n   \n   To learn more, including how to create and call endpoints, see Custom HTTPS Endpoints. \nHOW THE DATA API WORKS \nData API requests may resemble traditional database operations, like find or insertOne, but the Data API is not a direct connection to your database. Instead, the Data API adds additional authentication, authorization, and correctness checks to ensure that your data is only accessed or modified in the ways you allow. This allows you to safely access data in Atlas from potentially vulnerable clients like web apps. For each incoming request, the Data API:  1. Authenticates the calling user. This might involve validating an access token, logging in with header credentials, or directly assigning a specific runtime user based on your configuration.  2. Authorizes the request. This ensures that the user sent a well-formed request and has permission to perform the requested operation based on your endpoint authorization scheme.  3. Runs the requested operation. This might involve reading or writing data in Atlas with a generated endpoint or invoke a custom function that you wrote.\n    \n    For requests that read or write data in Atlas, the Data API also enforces the access control rules and document schemas defined in your App. This means that users can only access data they're allowed to read and write. Requests fail if they include an invalid write operation.  4. Returns an HTTPS response to the caller. The response includes the result of a generated endpoint operation or any data that you return from a custom endpoint. In the request, you can choose to receive the response in either JSON or EJSON format. \nWHEN TO USE THE DATA API \nFor server applications, and especially for high-load and latency sensitive use-cases, we recommend connecting directly to Atlas with a MongoDB driver. Operations called through a Data API endpoint take longer to complete than the corresponding MongoDB operations called through a driver. Additionally, the drivers provide more flexibility and control over how your operations are executed. To learn more, visit the MongoDB Drivers documentation. We recommend using the Data API when:  * You want to run MongoDB operations from a web application or other client that you can't trust.  * You can't or don't want to manage a MongoDB driver in your server-side environment.

Instances \nOVERVIEW \nA data source represents a MongoDB Atlas instance in the same project as your app. You use data sources to store and retrieve your application's data. Most apps connect to a single data source, but you can configure multiple data sources if your data is spread across instances. You define a unique name for each data source linked to your application and use the name to refer to the data source throughout your app. Requests to data sources are routed through Atlas App Services. Because of this, App Services automatically opens and closes database connections. This means you don't need to worry about calling db.close() when using a data source. \nREAD, WRITE, AND AGGREGATE DATA \nYou can read and write data in a data source from a server-side function or connect from a client application. You write queries using standard MongoDB query syntax. exports = async function() {   const mongodb = context.services.get(\"mongodb-atlas\");   return mongodb      .db(\"myDatabase\")      .collection(\"myCollection\")      .findOne()}  To learn how to work with a data source in an Atlas Function, refer to the following guides:      * Read Data from MongoDB Atlas  * Write Data in MongoDB Atlas  * Aggregate Data in MongoDB Atlas To learn how to work with a data source from a Realm SDK, refer to Query Atlas from Client Apps. \nNOTE Linked data sources do not support all MongoDB CRUD and Aggregation operations. Some operations are not available when you query MongoDB as a specific user due to overhead from schema validation and data access rules. You can bypass some limitations by querying MongoDB as the system user instead. For more information on which operations are supported, see CRUD & Aggregation APIs. \nSECURE AND VALIDATE DATA \nData sources allow you to define access rules and document schemas for the data they contain. Rules dynamically authorize users to read and write subsets of your data and schemas control the shape and contents of each document. Read and write operations on a linked data source are secure by default. A user cannot read or write any data unless a rule explicitly allows them to. Any data inserted or modified by an authorized user must conform to the corresponding schema. If you do not define rules for a collection, queries on the collection will fail. This means that you can safely expose a properly configured data source interface in client applications without risking data corruption or leaks. \nAUTOMATICALLY SYNC DATA \nAtlas Device Sync applications store data and sync data changes to a linked cluster, called the synced cluster. The sync protocol ensures that your data is eventually consistent across all sync clients and the synced cluster. To learn more about Atlas Device Sync and how it interacts with your app's data sources, see Atlas Device Sync. \nNOTE \nVERSION 4.4 REQUIRED FOR SYNC In order to use Atlas Device Sync, your cluster must run MongoDB version 4.4 or newer. \nREACT TO CHANGING DATA \nYou can create database triggers that run functions automatically in response to changing data. Triggers use MongoDB change streams to observe the data source and execute a function whenever a change event matches the trigger configuration. A trigger function can run arbitrary code and can access a change event for detailed information about the change that caused it to run. To learn more about how triggers work and how to define your own, see Database Triggers. \nIMPORTANT Triggers are only available for data sources that support change streams. You cannot define triggers on a Federated database instance or serverless Atlas instance. \nLINK A DATA SOURCE \nA configured data source in your app is linked to the underlying instance in Atlas. You can link multiple instances to your app and even create multiple data sources that link to the same underlying instance.

Function is a piece of server-side JavaScript code that you write to define your app's behavior. You can call your app's functions directly from a client app or define services that integrate and call functions automatically. Functions can call other functions and include a built-in client for working with data in MongoDB Atlas clusters. They also include helpful global utilities, support common Node.js built-in modules, and can import and use external packages from the npm registry. A basic function that returns a greeting exports = function(name) {  return `Hello, ${name ?? \"stranger\"}!`}  \nFUNCTIONS ARE SERVERLESS \nWhen a function is called, your app routes the request to a managed app server that evaluates your code and returns the result. This model makes functions serverless, which means that you don't have to deploy and manage a server to run the code. Instead, you write the function source code and your app handles the execution environment. \nFUNCTIONS HAVE CONTEXT \nA function runs in a context that reflects its execution environment. The context includes the user that called the function, how they called it, and the state of your app when they called it. You can use context to run user-specific code and work with other parts of your app. To learn more about how to work with function context, see Context. \nWHEN TO USE FUNCTIONS \nFunctions can run arbitrary JavaScript code that you define, which means you can use them for almost anything. Common use cases include low-latency, short-running tasks like data movement, transformations, and validation. You can also use them to connect to external services and abstract away implementation details from your client applications. In addition to functions that you invoke directly, you also write functions for various services like HTTPS Endpoints, Triggers, and GraphQL custom resolvers. These services automatically call functions to handle specific events. For example, whenever a database trigger observes a change event it calls its associated function with the change event as an argument. In the trigger function, you can then access information from the change event and respond appropriately. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO:      * HTTPS Endpoints  * Triggers  * GraphQL Custom Resolvers  * Email/Password Registration \nHOW TO WRITE A FUNCTION \nThe code for a function is essentially a named JavaScript source file, which means you can define multiple JavaScript functions in a single function file. The file must export a single JavaScript function from to serve as the entrypoint for incoming calls. When you call a function by name, you're actually calling the JavaScript function assigned to exports in the function's source file. For example, here's a simple function that accepts a name argument, adds a log message, and returns a greeting for the provided name: exports = function Hello(name) {  console.log(`Said hello to

This is useful to preserve type information but may not be what your application expects. For example, the values in the object returned from the following function are converted into structured EJSON values: exports = function() {  return {    pi: 3.14159,    today: new Date(),  }} HIDE OUTPUT {  \"pi\": {    \"$numberDouble\": \"3.14159\"  },  \"today\": {    \"$date\": {      \"$numberLong\": \"1652297239913\"    }  }} To return a value as standard JSON, call JSON.stringify() on the value and then return the stringified result: exports = function() {  return JSON.stringify({    pi: 3.14159,    today: new Date(),  })} HIDE OUTPUT \"{\\\"pi\\\":3.14159,\\\"today\\\":\\\"2022-05-11T19:27:32.207Z\\\"}\" \nUSER AND SYSTEM FUNCTIONS \nA function can run in two contexts depending on how they're configured and called:  * A user function runs in the context of a specific user of your application. Typically this is the logged in user that called the function. User functions are subject to rules and schema validation.  * A system function runs as the system user instead of a specific application user. System functions have full access to MongoDB CRUD and Aggregation APIs and bypass all rules and schema validation. \nNOTE \nDYNAMIC CONTEXT.USER REFERENCES References to context.user always resolve to the authenticated user that called a function if there was one, even if the function runs as a system function. To determine if a function is running as a system function, call context.runningAsSystem(). If a function executes without being called by an authenticated user, such as in a trigger or webhook, then dynamic references resolve to the system user which has no id or other associated data. \nDEFINE A FUNCTION \nYou can create and manage functions in your application from the App Services UI or by importing the function configuration and source code with Realm CLI or GitHub deployment.   CALL A FUNCTION \nYou can call a function from other functions, from a connected client application, or with Realm CLI. The examples in this section demonstrate calling a simple function named sum that takes two arguments, adds them, and returns the result: // sum: adds two numbersexports = function sum(a, b) {  return a + b;};  \nCALL FROM A FUNCTION \nYou can call a function from another function through the context.functions interface, which is available as a global variable in any function. This include HTTPS endpoints, triggers, and GraphQL customer resolvers. The called function runs in the same context as the function that called it. // difference: subtracts b from a using the sum functionexports = function difference(a, b) {  return context.functions.execute(\"sum\", a, -1 * b);};  \nCALL FROM REALM CLI \nYou can call a function through Realm CLI with the function run command. The command returns the function result as EJSON as well as any log or error messages. realm-cli function run \\  --function=sum \\  --args=1 --args=2  By default, functions run in the system context. To call a function in the context of a specific user, include their User ID in the --user argument. realm-cli function run \\  --function=sum \\  --args=1 --args=2 \\  --user=61a50d82532cbd0de95c7c89  \nCALL FROM RULE EXPRESSIONS \nYou can call a function from a rule expression by using the %function operator. The operator evaluates to the return value of the function.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nBILLING \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Monthly Free Tier\n * Invoicing and Payment\n * Usage Types\n * App Services Requests\n * App Services Compute\n * Atlas Device Sync\n * Data Transfer\n * Examples\n * Mobile Application\n * Web Application\n * Backend Application \nOVERVIEW \nAtlas App Services Apps are billed according to how much they're used on a monthly basis. There are four independently-measured usage types that determine how much you pay each month:      * App Services Requests, which measures the number of requests that App Services sends and receives from client applications and external services. Requests include function calls, trigger executions, and sync updates, but exclude user authentication and blocked or invalid requests.  * App Services Compute, which measures the runtime and memory usage of all requests excluding sync and authentication.  * Atlas Device Sync, which measures the total amount of time in which a client application is actively syncing.  * Data Transfer, which measures the amount of data that App Services sends to external services and client applications. \nNOTE \nTRACK YOUR USAGE You can track an application's usage for the current month from the application dashboard in the App Services UI. \nMONTHLY FREE TIER \nAll App Services Apps in a MongoDB Atlas project share a single monthly free tier. All usage below the free tier thresholds in a given month is not billed. As soon as a project exceeds any monthly free tier threshold, App Services starts billing for additional usage of any kind for that project. FREE TIER THRESHOLDS \nApp Services is free to use below the following monthly free tier thresholds:  * 1,000,000 requests or 500 hours of compute or 10,000 hours of sync runtime (whichever occurs first)  * 10GB of data transfer \nINVOICING AND PAYMENT \nApp Services is billed as part of MongoDB Atlas. All payment methods that work with Atlas can be used to pay for App Services, including prepaid Atlas Credits. Any costs associated with a linked Atlas data source, such as database operations and backup, are billed separately from App Services. See MongoDB Atlas Billing for more information. \nUSAGE TYPES  APP SERVICES REQUESTS \nApp Services counts the number of requests that an application receives and handles. Requests are billed at a set rate for each request. There are several types of requests:  * Function Executions, such as when a user calls a function from a client app or when a function calls an external service. If an executing function calls another function, App Services considers both executions as part of the same request.  * Trigger Executions, such as when a database trigger matches a change event, a scheduled trigger is configured to fire, or an authentication trigger responds to a user login. The request resulting from a trigger execution also includes all operations invoked by the trigger, including functions.  * GraphQL Requests, such as when a client application issues a GraphQL query operation or calls a custom resolver.  * HTTPS Requests, such as when an external service sends a notification event or interaction payload to an incoming webhook or HTTPS endpoint.  * Sync Operations, such as when a sync client uploads a changeset, when App Services resolves a conflict in an uploaded changeset, or when App Services sends changesets to a connected sync client.\n   \n   For more information on sync operations, see Atlas Device Sync Protocol. All incoming requests count toward your monthly usage except for the following:  * Requests to an authentication provider  * Requests blocked by an application's IP Access List  * Requests to an invalid HTTP endpoint Price: $2.00 / 1,000,000 requests ($0.000002 / request) Formula: (Function Executions + Trigger Executions + GraphQL/Webhook/HTTPS Endpoint Requests + Sync Updates) * $0.000002 Free Tier Threshold: 1,000,000 requests or 500 hours of compute or 10,000 hours of sync runtime (whichever occurs first) \nEXAMPLE \nESTIMATE YOUR USAGE Consider answering the following questions to help estimate the number of requests that your application will receive each month. Triggers  * How many times does this trigger execute each month? Functions/GraphQL  * How many requests do you receive each user session?  * How many monthly active users does your app have?  * How many sessions does an average user open each month? Atlas Device Sync Requests  * How many write operations do users issue each session?  * How many updates do users receive each session?  * How many devices or active users does your app have? \nAPP

Data transfer is billed at a set rate for each gigabyte of data egress. Price: $0.12 per GB Formula: (Data sent to clients/services (GB)) * ($0.12 / GB) Free Tier Threshold: 10GB \nNOTE \nMONGODB ATLAS DATA TRANSFER Data transfer from a linked MongoDB Atlas data source to App Services is billed as an Atlas Data Egress charge. To learn more about Atlas egress rates, read the Data Transfer billing documentation. \nEXAMPLE \nESTIMATE YOUR USAGE Consider answering the following questions to help estimate the amount of data that your application will transfer each month. Data Transfer  * How many updates/requests does an average user issues each month?  * How much data is sent to users per update/request?  * How often is data sent to external services?  * How much data might be sent in each external service call? \nEXAMPLES  MOBILE APPLICATION \nA group messaging application uses App Services to manage permissions and sync messages between users in the same group. The app has the following usage:  * There are around 2,000 active group chats in any given month.  * The average group chat has 4 users that each send around 900 messages each month.  * Messages are usually small but may contain up to 2KB of data.  * The average user has the app open for about 9 hours each month. The following calculations approximate the cost of running this application for one month: Usage Type\nCalculation\nApp Services Requests  * (2000 chats) * (4 users / chat) * (900 messages / user) = 7,200,000 messages  * (7,200,000 messages) * ((1 write + 3 reads) / message) = 28,800,000 requests  * (28,800,000 requests) - (1,000,000 free tier requests) = 27,800,000 requests  * (27,800,000 requests) * ($0.000002 / request) = $55.60 Atlas Device Sync  * (2000 chats) * (4 users / chat) * (9 hrs / user) = 72,000 active hrs  * (72,000 active hrs) - (2,500 free tier hours) = 69,500 active hrs  * (69,500 active hrs) * (60 mins / hr) * ($0.00000008 / min) = $0.33 Data Transfer  * (7,200,000 messages) * (3 reads / message) = 21,600,000 reads  * (21,600,000 reads) * (0.000002 GB / read) =

your consumption each month. For this example, we assume that all requests and activity are spread evenly throughout the month. On every day of a 30 day month this application would handle 960,000 requests, 2,400 sync hours, and 1.44 GB of data transfer. The app would hit the requests/compute/sync threshold on the second day of the month and the data transfer threshold on the seventh day. The free tier would cover the following usage in each area:  * App Services Requests: 1,000,000 requests  * Atlas Device Sync: 2,500 hours  * Data Transfer: 10 GB \nWEB APPLICATION \nA hardware store uses a web application that allows customers to browse and order items online. The app uses Atlas Functions and the GraphQL API to fetch items based on a user's search, get detailed information for specific items, and submit orders. The app has the following usage:  * There are around 100,000 visitors each month  * An average visitor performs 2 searches, looks at 10 items, and submits an order 20% of the time.  * Search results, item data, and order requests contain 4KB or less The following calculations approximate the cost of running this application for one month: Usage Type\nCalculation\nApp Services Requests  * (2 searches + 10 items + 0.20 orders) / visitor = 12.2 requests / visitor  * (12.2 requests / visitor) * (100,000 visitors) = 1,220,000 requests  * (1,220,000 requests) - (1,000,000 free tier requests) = (220,000 requests)  * (220,000 requests) * ($0.000002 / request) = $0.44 App Services Compute  * (100,000 visitors) * ((2 searches + 10 items + 0.20 orders) / visitor) = 1,220,000 requests  * (1,220,000 requests) * (100 ms / request) * 1 = 122,000,000 ms\n   \n   * 100 ms is a conservative runtime estimate for lightweight functions\n   \n   * 4KB is well under 32MB, so the memory multiplier is 1  * (122,000,000 ms) - (28,152,000 free tier ms) = 93,848,000 ms  * (93,848,000 ms) * ($0.000000005 / ms) = $0.47 Data Transfer  * (1,220,000 requests) * (0.000002 GB / request) = 4.88 GB  * (4.88 GB) - (10 free tier GB) = 0GB  * (0GB) * ($0.12 / GB) = FREE TOTAL\n$0.44 (requests) + $0.47 (compute) + $0 (data transfer) = $0.91 / month \nNOTE \nFREE TIER USAGE The way that free tier usage affects your bill depends on your consumption each month. For this example, we assume that all requests and activity are spread evenly throughout the month. On every day of a 30 day month this application would handle 41,290 requests, 1.3 compute hours, and 16.8 GB of data transfer. The app would hit the requests/compute threshold on the 24th day of the month and the data transfer threshold on the first day. The free tier would cover the following usage in each area:  * App Services Requests: 1,000,000 requests  * App Services Compute: 7.82 hours  * Data Transfer: 10 GB \nBACKEND APPLICATION \nA regional pizza chain uses App Services to handle orders for all of its restaurants. The app has the following usage:  * The chain has 25 stores and each store gets about 12,000 orders each month  * For each order, a database trigger sends the customer an email receipt. Another trigger sends text message updates to the customer when their order is received, when it's sent out for delivery, and when it's about to be delivered.  * A scheduled trigger runs every 5 minutes to monitor delivery times. If a delivery is taking too long, it sends a text message update to the user.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nFACEBOOK AUTHENTICATION \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Configuration\n * Set Up a Facebook App\n * Create a Facebook App\n * Enable Facebook Login\n * Add App Services as a Valid OAuth Redirect URI\n * Configure the Facebook Authentication Provider\n * Examples \nOVERVIEW \nThe Facebook authentication provider allows users to log in with their existing Facebook account through a companion Facebook application. When a user logs in, Facebook provides Atlas App Services with an OAuth 2.0 access token for the user. App Services uses the token to identify the user and access approved data from the Facebook API on their behalf. For more information on Facebook Login, see Facebook Login for Apps. \nCONFIGURATION   The Facebook authentication provider has the following configuration options: Field\nDescription\nClient ID\nconfig.clientId Required. The App ID of the Facebook app. See Set Up a Facebook App for information about setting up your Facebook app and finding the App ID. Client Secret\nsecret_config.clientSecret Required. The name of a Secret that stores the App Secret of the Facebook app. See Set Up a Facebook App for information about setting up your Facebook app and finding the App Secret. Metadata Fields\nmetadata_fields Optional. A list of fields describing the authenticated user that your application will request from the Facebook Graph API. All metadata fields are omitted by default and can be required on a field-by-field basis. Users must explicitly grant your app permission to access each required field. If a metadata field is required and exists for a particular user, it will be included in their user object. To require a metadata field from an import/export configuration file, add an entry for the field to the metadata_fields array. Each entry should be a document of the following form: { name: \"<metadata field name>\", required: \"<boolean>\" } \nRedirect URIs\nredirect_uris Required for web applications. A list of allowed redirect URIs. Once a user completes the authentication process on Facebook, App Services redirects them back to either a specified redirect URI or, if no redirect URI is specified, the URL that they initiated the authentication request from. App Services will only redirect a user to a URI that exactly matches an entry in this list, including the protocol and any trailing slashes. Domain Restrictions\ndomain_restrictions Optional. A list of approved domains for user accounts. If specified, the provider checks the domain of a user's primary email address on Facebook and only allows them to authenticate if the domain matches an entry in this list. For example, if example1.com and example2.com are listed, a Facebook user with a primary email of joe.mango@example1.com would be allowed to log in, while a user with a primary email of joe.mango@example3.com would not be allowed to log in. \nNOTE If you've specified any domain restrictions, you must also require the email address field in the Metadata Fields setting. \nSET UP A FACEBOOK APP \nThe Facebook authentication provider requires a Facebook app to manage authentication and user permissions. The following steps walk through creating the app, setting up Facebook Login, and configuring the provider to connect with the app. 1 \nCREATE A FACEBOOK APP \nFollow Facebook's official guide to create a new Facebook app. 2 \nENABLE FACEBOOK LOGIN \nFrom the app's Dashboard view, find the Facebook Login card and click Set Up. You should see a list of quickstart guides for each platform. Follow the guide for your platform to enable Facebook Login. \nNOTE App Services web applications do not require you to install the Facebook SDK to use the Facebook authentication provider. If you are incorporating Facebook Login into a web application you can skip any steps in the quickstart related to setting up the Facebook SDK for JavaScript. 3 \nADD APP SERVICES AS A VALID OAUTH REDIRECT URI \nWhen a user completes the login flow for your Facebook app they need to be redirected back to App Services. Facebook Login will only allow users to redirect to a pre-approved list of URIs. From the Facebook Login > Settings page, add an App Services authentication callback URL that corresponds to the deployment region of your application to the list of Valid OAuth Redirect URIs. The following table lists the callback URL for each region: Region\nApp Services Authentication Callback URL\nGlobal https://realm.mongodb.com/api/client/v2.0/auth/callback \nVirginia\n(us-east-1)

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nGOOGLE AUTHENTICATION \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Set Up a Project in the Google API Console\n * Create a Project in the Google API Console\n * Generate OAuth Client Credentials\n * Configure the Google Authentication Provider\n * Configure in App Services\n * Examples \nOVERVIEW \nThe Google authentication provider allows users to log in with their existing Google account through Google Sign-In. When a user logs in, Google provides Atlas App Services with an OAuth 2.0 access token for the user. App Services uses the token to identify the user and access approved data from Google APIs on their behalf. \nSET UP A PROJECT IN THE GOOGLE API CONSOLE \nYou must set up a project in the Google API Console before you configure Google Authentication in App Services. Follow the SDK-specific steps to set up Google Authentication in the Google API Console.  \nThe Google authentication provider requires a project in the Google API Console to manage authentication and user permissions. The following steps walk through creating the project, generating OAuth credentials, and configuring the provider to connect with the project. 1 \nCREATE A PROJECT IN THE GOOGLE API CONSOLE \nFollow Google's official guide to create a new GCP project. 2 \nGENERATE OAUTH CLIENT CREDENTIALS   Follow Google's support guide on Setting up OAuth 2.0 for your project.  3 \nCONFIGURE THE GOOGLE AUTHENTICATION PROVIDER \nTo connect your GCP project to App Services add the OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret you generated in the previous step to your authentication provider configuration.   CONFIGURE IN APP SERVICES   The Google authentication provider has the following configuration options: Field\nDescription\nClient ID\nconfig.clientId Required. An OAuth 2.0 Client ID for your project in the Google API Console. See Set Up a Project in the Google API Console for information about setting up OAuth Credentials for your GCP project. Client Secret\nsecret_config.clientSecret Required. The name of a Secret that stores an OAuth 2.0 Client Secret for your project from the Google API Console. See Set Up a Project in the Google API Console for information about setting up OAuth Credentials for your GCP project. Metadata Fields\nmetadata_fields Optional. A list of fields describing the authenticated user that your application will request from the Google Identity API. All metadata fields are omitted by default and can be required on a field-by-field basis. Users must explicitly grant your app permission to access each required field. If a metadata field is required and exists for a particular user, it will be included in their user object. To require a metadata field from an import/export configuration file, add an entry for the field to the metadata_fields array. Each entry should be a document of the following form: { name: \"<metadata field name>\", required: \"<boolean>\" } \nRedirect URIs\nredirect_uris Required for web applications. A list of allowed redirect URIs. Once a user completes the authentication process on Google, App Services redirects them back to either a specified redirect URI or, if no redirect URI is specified, the URL that they initiated the authentication request from. App Services will only redirect a user to a URI that exactly matches an entry in this list, including the protocol and any trailing slashes. Domain Restrictions\ndomain_restrictions Optional. A list of approved domains for user accounts. If specified, the provider checks the domain of a user's primary email address on Google and only allows them to authenticate if the domain matches an entry in this list. For example, if example1.com and example2.com are listed, a Google user with a primary email of joe.mango@example1.com would be allowed to log in, while a user with a primary email of joe.mango@example3.com would not be allowed to log in. \nNOTE If you've specified any domain restrictions, you must also require the email address field in the Metadata Fields setting. OpenID Connect\nconfig.openId Optional. Default false. If true, the provider uses OpenID Connect to authenticate users. \nIMPORTANT \nOPENID CONNECT SUPPORT VARIES BY SDK Refer to SDK-specific documentation about support for OpenID Connect.

Function\n * Automatically Confirm Users\n * Password Resets\n * Send a Password Reset Email\n * Run a Password Reset Function\n * Examples\n * Summary \nOVERVIEW \nEmail/password authentication lets users register and login using an email address. Atlas App Services must confirm Email/Password users before they may log in. \nNOTE User email addresses are case-sensitive. For example, a user with the email address TestAccount@example.com could not log in using the testaccount@example.com address. \nCONFIGURATION   \nUSER CONFIRMATION  SEND A CONFIRMATION EMAIL \nWith this confirmation method, users must respond to an email upon registration. The email contains a link to a confirmation URL. The user must visit this link within 30 minutes to confirm that they control the email address. Configure the following settings to have App Services automatically send a confirmation email:      * Email Confirmation URL: the base of the URL included in every confirmation email. App Services appends a unique token and tokenId to this URL. These serve as query parameters to create a unique link for every confirmation. To confirm the user, first extract these query parameters from the user's unique URL. Then, pass the token and tokenId to the Client SDK's confirmUser function.\n   \n   Mobile applications can handle email confirmation directly in the app. To do this, configure deep linking in Android or universal links in iOS.  * Email Confirmation Subject: the subject line for the email that App Services sends. This value is optional if omitted, App Services uses a default subject line instead. Custom email confirmation subjects can contain a maximum of 256 characters. \nNOTE Confirmation emails are not currently customizable beyond the base URL and subject line. In particular, they always come from a mongodb.com email address. For production apps, we recommend using a confirmation function rather than the built-in confirmation email method. Confirmation functions allow you to build entirely custom email confirmations. See Run a Confirmation Function for more information. \nRUN A CONFIRMATION FUNCTION \nThe provider can Run a Confirmation Function when a new user registers App Services passes to this function unique confirmation tokens and user data. The return value is one of two outcomes. Either App Services immediately confirms the user, or requires additional confirmation. Confirmation must come from the client application. Within the function, you can define custom logic to confirm users. For example:  * Send custom confirmation emails from a specific domain. Send these with a particular template using an external service.  * Read user permissions from a collection in MongoDB Atlas or an external REST service. Use to confirm whether a user has authorization to use the application.  * Send confirmation messages through a service other than email. Configure the following settings to have App Services automatically run a confirmation function:  * Function: the function run when a user registers a new account with your App. This function must return an object containing a status key. This key maps to a string with one of the following values: success, pending, or fail. The custom confirmation function signature has one parameter. It is an object, which contains user data and confirmation tokens. These fields are: Field\nDescription\nusername\nThe user's email address.\ntoken\nA unique value used to confirm the user's identity. Use in the SDK confirmUser function.\ntokenId\nA unique value used to confirm the user's identity. Uses the SDK confirmUser function. The custom user confirmation function returns an object with a status field. The following table describes the potential values of this field: Status\nEffect\nsuccess\nApp Services confirms the user's identity, allowing the user to log into their new account.\npending\nApp Services changes the user's confirmation status to pending. This does not confirm the user's identity or allow login. The client application must call the confirmUser SDK function to confirm.\nfail\nApp Services deletes the pending user. The user can only retry account confirmation by registering an entirely new account. Since the previous account no longer exists, the same username can be reused.

 \nAUTOMATICALLY CONFIRM USERS \nYou can configure the provider to Automatically Confirm Users. When selected, App Services immediately confirms new Email/Password users after registration. \nWARNING App Services does not validate automatically confirmed email addresses. As a result, there are a few reasons you may not be able to contact such users via email:  * An automatically confirmed user's email address might not actually belong to that user. (e.g. a user could sign up as steve.jobs@apple.com)  * A user's email address may not even be a valid email address. (e.g. a user could sign up as my.name@gmail or asdavaskljj) Exercise caution with this option. Securely resetting the password of a user account with no valid contact information can be very difficult. \nPASSWORD RESETS \nApp Services resets Email/Password user passwords in one of two ways: \nSEND A PASSWORD RESET EMAIL \nYou can configure the provider to Send a Password Reset Email. When a user requests a password reset, App Services sends a Password Reset URL to a user's email address. The user must visit this URL within 30 minutes. When you configure password reset emails, you can configure the following settings:  * Password Reset URL: the base of the URL included in every password reset email. App Services appends a unique token and tokenId to this URL. These serve as query parameters to create a unique link for every password reset. To reset the user's password, extract these query parameters from the user's unique URL. Pass the token and tokenId to the Client SDK's resetPassword function.  * Reset Password Email Subject: the subject line for the email that App Services sends. This value is optional: if omitted, App Services uses a default subject line instead. Custom password reset subjects can contain a maximum of 256 characters. \nNOTE \nUSE DEEP LINKS IN MOBILE APPS Mobile applications can handle password resets directly in the app. Configure deep linking in Android or universal links in iOS. \nRUN A PASSWORD RESET FUNCTION \nYou can configure the provider to Run a Password Reset Function. You define a Function for App Services to run when you callResetPasswordFunction() in the SDK. App Services passes this function unique confirmation tokens and data about the user. Use these values to define custom logic to reset a user's password. App Services can immediately reset the user's password. Or you can require additional confirmation from the client application. You can use a custom password reset function to define your own password reset flows:  * Send custom password reset emails from a specific domain with a particular template using an external service.  * Interface with a MongoDB Atlas collection to implement a password reset \"cooldown period\". This can prevent too many password reset attempts on a single account in a particular time range.  * Send custom password reset messages through a service other than email. App Services can automatically run a password reset function. Configure the following settings:  * Function: the function run when an instance of the client SDK calls callResetPasswordFunction. This function must return an object containing a status key. The key maps to a string with one of the following values: success, pending, or fail. \nNOTE Using a password reset function causes the client SDK sendResetPasswordEmail() function to return an error. The password reset function may return a pending status. If so, you may still need to call resetPassword(). The custom password reset function signature is variadic: it accepts any number of parameters. The first is always an object containing user data and confirmation tokens. All following parameters are custom parameters. They are passed into the Client SDK as an argument collection. For instance, the Client SDK call: callResetPasswordFunction(\"myUsername\", \"newPassword\", [\"Security Question Answer 1\", \"Security Question Answer 2\", \"securityCode:0510\"])  Becomes this customized signature for the password reset function: resetFunc({username, password, token, tokenId}, securityAnswer1, securityAnswer2, securitySMSCode)  There are multiple elements of the custom argument array. Starting with the second parameter, these elements are passed into the password reset function. In the custom password reset function, an object must be passed as the first parameter. The following table describes the fields found in said object: Field\nDescription\nusername\nThe email address of the user.\npassword\nA new proposed password for the user. If this function returns the successful status, this is the user's new password.\ntoken\nA unique value used to update the user's password.\ntokenId\nA unique value used to confirm the user's identity

function. You can use this provider to implement your own user authentication logic or integrate an external authentication system. \nWHEN TO USE CUSTOM FUNCTION AUTHENTICATION \nCustom function authentication is the most flexible form of authentication. However, it also requires you to manually define and configure the authentication flow yourself. Before you define a custom function provider, consider if you can one use of the built-in authentication providers instead. Consider using the custom function provider in your app if:      * You want to use an external authentication service that does not have a built-in provider. If the service uses JSON web tokens, consider creating a Custom JWT provider instead.  * You want to customize the authentication process beyond what's available in a built-in provider. For example, you could use a service to send customized confirmation emails instead of the default email/password provider emails. \nIMPORTANT Atlas App Services does not perform any data validation or authentication checks for the custom function provider. Make sure that you validate incoming data and that your authentication system performs appropriate authentication checks, such as requiring a password, two-factor authentication, or a single sign-on token. \nTHE AUTHENTICATION FUNCTION \nThe authentication function is a JavaScript function that holds your custom user authentication code. It runs whenever a user logs in through the custom function provider. The function maps data provided at login, like a username and password or an access token, to a string that uniquely identifies the user in your external authentication system. For example, you could use the provided data to log in to an external service over HTTP or using a package from npm. exports = async function (payload) {  // 1. Parse the `payload` object, which holds data from the  //    FunctionCredential sent by the SDK.  const { username, password } = payload;\n  // 2. Create a new user or log in an existing user in the external  //    authentication service.\n  // You can use a client library from npm  const auth = require(\"fake-auth-service\");  const user = await auth.login({ username, password });\n  // Or you can communicate directly over HTTP  const userFromHttp = await context.http.post({    url: \"https://example.com/auth/login\",    headers: {      Authorization: [\"Basic bmlja0BleGFtcGxlLmNvbTpQYTU1dzByZA==\"],    },    body: JSON.stringify({ username, password }),  });\n  // 3. Return a unique identifier for the user. Typically this is the  //    user's ID in the external authentication system or the _id of a  //    stored MongoDB document that describes them.  //  //    !!! This is NOT the user's internal account ID for your app !!!  return user.id;};  \nRECEIVE A CUSTOM CREDENTIAL PAYLOAD \nThe payload object passed to the function contains data that was included with the custom function provider credential in the client app. The function accepts any value provided from your client app, so the actual field names and values depend on your implementation. For examples of how to create a custom credential payload object using the Realm SDKs, refer to the documentation for each SDK:  * C++ SDK  * Flutter SDK  * Java SDK  * Kotlin SDK  * .NET SDK  * Node.js SDK  * React Native SDK  * Swift SDK  * Web SDK \nRETURN AN AUTHENTICATED USER ID \nIf authentication is successful, the function should return a unique string identifier for the user. For example, you could return the user ID value used by your external authentication system.

If an existing user is already associated with the external ID, the provider logs that user in. If the provider has no record of a given external ID, it creates a new user account, adds a custom function provider identity, and then logs in the new user. The identity object for the custom function provider is stored in the user object and resembles the following: {  \"id\": \"<Internal User Account ID>\",  \"identities\": [     {       \"providerType\": \"custom-function\",       \"id\": \"<External User ID>\",     }  ]}  \nEXAMPLE The authentication function should return a unique external ID as a string: return \"5f650356a8631da45dd4784c\"  You can also return an object that contains the external ID as its id value: return { \"id\": \"5f650356a8631da45dd4784c\" }  If you want to define a display name for the user, define it in the name field of the returned object: return {  \"id\": \"5f650356a8631da45dd4784c\",  \"name\": \"James Bond\"}  \nTHROW AN ERROR FOR FAILED AUTHENTICATION \nIf the user provided invalid credentials or the function otherwise fails to authenticate the user, throw an error with a descriptive message. This returns a 401 - Unauthorized error with the message attached to the SDK. const auth = require(\"some-external-auth-system\");try {  const user = await auth.login(payload);  return user.id;} catch (err) {  throw new Error(`Authentication failed with reason: ${err.message}`);}  \nSET UP THE CUSTOM FUNCTION PROVIDER \nYou can configure custom function authentication using any supported deployment method.   CONFIGURE CUSTOM USER DATA \nYou can associate custom data in a MongoDB Atlas collection with user accounts in your app. This can be helpful if you often need to access a user's data but is not required to use the custom function provider. A user's custom data document may contain any data. For apps that use the custom function provider, we recommend storing both the user's internal user account ID and their external ID. For example, you might use the following format: {  \"_id\": \"<Generated ObjectId>\",  \"user_id\": \"<Internal User ID>\",  \"external_id\": \"<External User ID>\"}  You can use the following approach to create custom user documents for custom function provider users:  1. Configure custom user data for a collection in your linked cluster. The User ID field stores the user's internal account ID.\n    \n    /auth/custom_user_data.json\n    \n    {  \"mongo_service_name\": \"mongodb-atlas\",  \"database_name\": \"myApp\",  \"collection_name\": \"users\",  \"user_id_field\": \"user_id\",  \"enabled\": true}\n    \n      2. Configure the custom function authentication provider and return a unique external user ID from the authentication function. App Services stores this ID in the id field of the user's custom-function identity.\n    \n    exports = async function handleCustomFunctionAuth(payload) {  const auth =

multi-platform applications in C# with MAUI. This tutorial is based on the .NET Flexible Sync Template App, named maui.todo.flex, which illustrates the creation of a Todo application in MAUI. This application enables users to:      * Register their email as a new user account.  * Sign in to their account with their email and password (and sign out).  * View, create, modify, and delete tasks. In this tutorial, you will add a new Priority field to the existing Item model and update the Flexible Sync subscription to only show items within a range of priorities. Depending on your experience with MAUI, this tutorial should take around 30 minutes. \nNOTE \nCHECK OUT THE QUICK START If you prefer to get started with your own application rather than follow a guided tutorial, check out the .NET Quick Start. It includes copyable code examples and the essential information that you need to set up an Atlas App Services backend. \nPREREQUISITES \n * Ensure that you have the necessary software installed. Select the tab for your development environment:\n   \n   \n     * You need previous experience deploying a MAUI or Xamarin app to an Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, and/or a physical device.  * This tutorial starts with a Template App. You need an Atlas Account, an API key, and realm-cli to create a Template App.\n   \n   * You can learn more about creating an Atlas account in the Atlas Getting Started documentation. For this tutorial, you need an Atlas account with a free-tier cluster.\n   \n   * You also need an Atlas API key for the MongoDB Cloud account you wish to log in with. You must be a Project Owner to create a Template App using realm-cli.\n   \n   * To learn more about installing realm-cli, see Install realm-cli. After you have installed realm-cli, login using the API key for your Atlas project. \nSTART WITH THE TEMPLATE \nThis tutorial is based on the MAUI Flexible Sync Template App named maui.todo.flex. We start with the default app and build new features on it. To learn more about the Template Apps, see Template Apps. If you don't already have an Atlas account, sign-up to deploy a Template App.   SET UP THE TEMPLATE APP \n1 \nOPEN THE APP \nNavigate to the directory where the Realm CLI created the template app and open the realm-todo-app.sln solution in Visual Studio. 2 \nEXPLORE THE APP STRUCTURE \nIn Visual Studio, take a few minutes to explore how the solution is organized. This is a organized like a standard MAUI MVVM solution, with a single project containing the views, models, and view models. The app uses a single model, Item, which implements IRealmObject. We have three views, one for logging in (LoginPage), another for viewing Items (ItemsPage), and a third for editing and creating new items. Each view has a corresponding view model. In addition to the standard MVVM structure, we have centralized all of the Realm logic into a RealmService class, which is found in the \"Services\" folder. This architecture ensures we are sharing the same realm throughout. 3 \nRUN THE APP \nWithout making any changes to the code, you should be able to run the app in either the Android emulator or the iOS Simulator, or on a physical device. You don't need to make any changes because, when you set up the template in the App Services UI or with the CLI, Atlas App Services also set up a new backend. If you downloaded the template app, you will need to add your App Services app's ID. To do so, open the Services/RealmService.cs file and add your ID to the private const string appId = \"appId\"; line.

\nMODIFY THE APPLICATION \nNow that you have confirmed everything is working as expected, we can add changes. In this tutorial, we have decided that we want to add a \"Priority\" property to each Item so that we can filter Items by their priorities. The Priority property will be mapped to a PriorityLevel enum to constrain the possible values. To do this, follow these steps: 1 \nADD THE PRIORITY PROPERTY \n A. In the RealmTodo project, expand the Models folder and open the Item class file.  B. Add the following public property:\n    \n    [MapTo(\"priority\")]public int? Priority { get; set; }\n    \n    \n    \n    Note that we have set this property as nullable, which will ensure that existing Items in our database (which do not have a Priority property) will continue to be available. 2 \nSET THE PRIORITY WHEN CREATING OR MODIFYING AN ITEM \n A. The EditItemViewModel ViewModel is used to both create new items and to modify existing items. When creating or modifying an item, the user needs the UI (and code) to set the Priority of an item.  B. Add an ObservableProperty to hold the priority:\n    \n    [ObservableProperty]private int? priority;\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    \n    [OBSERVABLEPROPERTY] ATTRIBUTE\n    \n    The [ObservableProperty] attribute is a feature provided by the MVVM Toolkit to simplify data binding.  C. The ApplyQueryAttributes method acts as a bit of a \"constructor\" for this view model, checking to see if an existing item is being passed to this view for editing. In here, we capture any existing values to display in the view.\n    \n    If we are editing an existing item, we want to set the Priority of the existing item: Priority = InitialItem.Priority;.\n    \n    Likewise, if we're creating a new item, set the default priority to \"Medium\": Priority = 2;.\n    \n    When complete this method should now look like the following:\n    \n    public void ApplyQueryAttributes(IDictionary<string, object> query){      if (query.Count > 0 && query[\"item\"] != null) // we're editing an Item      {         InitialItem = query[\"item\"] as Item;         Summary = InitialItem.Summary;         Priority = InitialItem.Priority;         PageHeader = $\"Modify Item {InitialItem.Id}\";      }      else // we're creating a new item      {         Summary = \"\";         Priority = 2;         PageHeader = \"Create a New Item\";      }}\n    \n      D. Finally, in the SaveItem() method, we want to persist the Priority value. Since we are creating or modifying a managed object, the changes are wrapped in a realm.WriteAsync call.\n    \n    For the existing item, set the InitialItem.Priority on the existing object, and for a new item, set the property in the Add() call. Your completed WriteAsync block should look like this:\n    \n    await realm.WriteAsync(() =>{   if (InitialItem != null) // editing an item   {      InitialItem.Summary = Summary;      InitialItem.Priority = Priority;   }   else // creating a new item   {      realm.Add(new Item()      {            OwnerId = RealmService.CurrentUser.Id,            Summary = summary,

 B. In the EditItemsPage.xaml, we will add two UI elements: a Picker that enables the user to choose which priority level to set on the new Item and a label for the picker. Find the Entry element for setting the Summary and add the following elements below it:\n    \n    <Label Text=\"Priority:\"/><Picker x:Name=\"newItemPriority\" SelectedIndex=\"{Binding Priority}\">   <Picker.Items>         <x:String>Severe</x:String>         <x:String>High</x:String>         <x:String>Medium</x:String>         <x:String>Low</x:String>   </Picker.Items></Picker>\n    \n     4 \nRUN AND TEST \nAt this point, you can run the application again. Log in using the account you created earlier in this tutorial. You will see the one Item you previously created. Add a new Item, and you will see that you can now set the priority. Choose High for the priority and save the Item. Now switch back to the Atlas data page in your browser, and refresh the Item collection. You should now see the new Item with the priority field added and set to 1. You will also notice that the existing Item now also has a priority field, and it is set to null, as shown in the following screenshot:  \nNOTE \nWHY DIDN'T THIS BREAK SYNC? Adding a property to a Realm object is not a breaking change and therefore does not require a client reset. The template app has Development Mode enabled, so changes to the client Realm object are reflected in the server-side schema. For more information, see Development Mode and Update Your Data Model. 1 \nUPDATE THE SUBSCRIPTION \nIn the RealmService.cs file, we define two Flexible Sync subscriptions. One shows only the items created by the current user, while the other shows all items from all users. We're going to add a new subscription that shows the current user's items that have a priority of 0 or 1.  A. At the bottom of the RealmService class, add an entry to the SubscriptionType enum called \"MyHighPriority\":\n    \n    public enum SubscriptionType{   Mine,   MyHighPriority,   All,}\n    \n      B. Scroll up to find the GetQueryForSubscriptionType method. It is here that we define the subscriptions.\n    \n    1. Copy the first one, where subType == SubscriptionType.Mine, and paste it in an else if block immediately below.\n    \n    2. Set the new conditional to subType == SubscriptionType.MyHighPriority.\n    \n    3. Modify this new subscription query to insert a LINQ query that still filters by OwnerId and also by Priority values less than 2.\n    \n    4. Change the name of the new query to \"myHighPri\". Your code will look like the following:\n    \n    if (subType == SubscriptionType.Mine){      query = realm.All<Item>()         .Where(i => i.OwnerId == CurrentUser.Id)         .Where(i => i.Priority < 2);      queryName = \"mine\";}else if (subType == SubscriptionType.MyHighPriority){      query = realm.All<Item>()        .Where(i => i.OwnerId == CurrentUser.Id &&               i.Priority < 2);

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nFLUTTER TUTORIAL \nOn this page    \n * Learning Objectives\n   \n * Prerequisites\n * Start with the Template\n * Set up the Template App\n * Open the App\n * Explore the App Structure\n * Run the App\n * Check the Backend\n * Modify the Application\n * Add a New Property\n * Set the Priority when Creating and Updating Items\n * Run and Test\n * Update the subscription\n * Run and Test\n * Update Flexible Sync on the Server\n * Test the changes\n * Conclusion\n * What's Next? The Realm Flutter SDK allows you to create a multi-platform applications with Dart and Flutter. This tutorial is based on the Flutter Flexible Sync Template App, named flutter.todo.flex, which illustrates the creation of a Todo application. This application enables users to:      * Register their email as a new user account.  * Sign in to their account with their email and password (and sign out later).  * View, create, modify, and delete task items.  * View all tasks, even where the user is not the owner. The template app also provides a toggle that simulates the device being in \"Offline Mode.\" This toggle lets you quickly test Device Sync functionality, emulating the user having no internet connection. However, you would likely remove this toggle in a production application. This tutorial adds on to the template app. You will add a new priority field to the existing Item model and update the Flexible Sync subscription to only show items within a range of priorities. Depending on your experience with Flutter, this tutorial should take around 30 minutes. \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \nThis tutorial illustrates how you might adapt the template app for your own needs. You would not necessarily make this change given the current structure of the template app. In this tutorial, you will learn how to:  * Update a Realm object model with a non-breaking change.  * Update a Device Sync subscription  * Add a queryable field to the Device Sync configuration on the server to change which data is synchronized. If you prefer to get started with your own application rather than follow a guided tutorial, check out the Flutter Quick Start. It includes copyable code examples and the essential information that you need to set up a Realm Flutter SDK application. \nPREREQUISITES \n * You should have previous experience deploying a Flutter app to an Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, and/or a physical device.  * This tutorial starts with a Template App. You need an Atlas Account, an API key, and realm-cli to create a Template App.\n   \n   * You can learn more about creating an Atlas account in the Atlas Getting Started documentation. For this tutorial, you need an Atlas account with a free-tier cluster.\n   \n   * You also need an Atlas API key for the MongoDB Cloud account you wish to log in with. You must be a Project Owner to create a Template App using realm-cli.\n   \n   * To learn more about installing realm-cli, see Install realm-cli. After you have installed realm-cli, login using the API key for your Atlas project. \nNOTE \nSUPPORTED PLATFORMS You can build this tutorial app on the following platforms:  * iOS  * Android  * macOS  * Windows  * Linux The Realm Flutter SDK does not support building web applications. \nSTART WITH THE TEMPLATE \nThis tutorial is based on the Flutter Flexible Sync Template App named flutter.todo.flex. We start with the default app and build new features on it. To learn more about the Template Apps, see Template Apps. If you don't already have an Atlas account, sign-up to deploy a Template App.   SET UP THE TEMPLATE APP \n1 \nOPEN THE APP \nOpen the Flutter app with your code editor. If you downloaded the client as a .zip file or cloned the client GitHub repository, you must manually insert the App Services App ID in the appropriate place in your client. Follow the Configuration instructions in the client README.md to learn where to insert your App ID. 2 \nEXPLORE THE APP STRUCTURE \nIn your code editor, take a few minutes to explore how the project is organized. This is a standard multi-platform Flutter application that has been modified for our specific use.

3 \nRUN THE APP \nWithout making any changes to the code, you should be able to run the app in either the Android emulator, iOS Simulator, physical mobile device, or desktop emulator. Attach to a device and run the Flutter application. Once the app is running, register a new user account, and then add a new Item to your todo list. \nTIP For more information on running a Flutter app with development tools, refer to the Flutter Test Drive documentation. 4 \nCHECK THE BACKEND \nLog in to MongoDB Atlas. In the Data Services tab, click on Browse Collections. In the list of databases, find and expand the todo database, and then the Item collection. You should see the document you created in this collection. \nMODIFY THE APPLICATION \n1 \nADD A NEW PROPERTY \nNow that you have confirmed everything is working as expected, we can add changes. In this tutorial, we have decided that we want to add a \"priority\" property to each Item so that we can filter Items by their priorities. To do this, follow these steps:  A. In the flutter.todo.flex project, open the file lib/realm/schemas.dart.  B. Add the following property to the _Item class:\n    \n    lib/realm/schemas.dart\n    \n    late int? priority;\n    \n      C. Regenerate the Item Realm object class:\n    \n    flutter pub run realm generate\n    \n     2 \nSET THE PRIORITY WHEN CREATING AND UPDATING ITEMS \n A. In lib/realm/realm_services.dart, add logic to set and update priority. Also add a PriorityLevel abstract class below the RealmServices class to constrain the possible values.\n    \n    lib/realm/realm_services.dart\n    \n    // ... imports\n    class RealmServices with ChangeNotifier {  static const String queryAllName = \"getAllItemsSubscription\";  static const String queryMyItemsName = \"getMyItemsSubscription\";\n      bool showAll = false;  bool offlineModeOn = false;  bool isWaiting = false;  late Realm realm;  User? currentUser;  App app;\n      // ...

This makes sure that the sync session restarts with the new schema and prevents sync errors. Then, Log in using the account you created earlier in this tutorial. You will see the one Item you previously created. Add a new Item, and you will see that you can now set the priority. Choose High for the priority and save the Item.

Now that we added the priority field, we want to update the Device Sync subscription to only sync Items marked as a High or Severe priority. 1 \nUPDATE THE SUBSCRIPTION \nIn the lib/realm/realm_services.dart file, we define the Flexible Sync subscription that defines which documents we sync with the user's device and account. Currently, we are syncing all all documents where the owner property matches the authenticated user. The current subscription: lib/realm/realm_services.dart   Future<void> updateSubscriptions() async {    realm.subscriptions.update((mutableSubscriptions) {      mutableSubscriptions.clear();      if (showAll) {        mutableSubscriptions.add(realm.all<Item>(), name: queryAllName);      } else {        mutableSubscriptions.add(            realm.query<Item>(r'owner_id == $0', [currentUser?.id]),            name: queryMyItemsName);      }    });    await realm.subscriptions.waitForSynchronization();  }  Now we're going to change the subscription to only sync High and Severe priority Items. As you may recall, the priority field is of type int, where the highest priority (\"Severe\") has a value of 0, and the lowest priority (\"Low\") has a value of 3. We can make direct comparisons between an int and the priority property. To do so, we're going to refactor the subscription query to include Items where the priority is less than or equal to PriorityLevel.high (or 1).

\n2 \nRUN AND TEST \nRun the application again. Log in using the account you created earlier in this tutorial. You would expect to not see the first Item created, since doesn't have a priority. But it is in the list. If you check your application logs in the terminal, you will see an entry that looks something like this: \"Client provided query with bad syntax: unsupported query for table \"Item\":   key \"priority\" is not a queryable field\" (error_code=300, query_version=1) This message tells us that we have added a field to our subscription without configuring Flexible Sync to use that field. 3 \nUPDATE FLEXIBLE SYNC ON THE SERVER \n A. Switch back to the Atlas page in your browser. Select the Atlas App Services tab and open the app you are using.  B. In the left-hand navigation, choose Device Sync, and then click OK in the dialog box about Development Mode being enabled.  C. Scroll down to the Select Queryable Fields section. In the dropdown labeled Select or create a queryable field, choose \"priority\". The priority field will be added to the fields shown:\n    \n      D. Save your changes. 4 \nTEST THE CHANGES \nReturn to your Flutter app. To ensure the subscription is re-run, log out the current user, and then log in again. After an initial moment when Realm resyncs the document collection, you might see an error message resembling the following: The following RangeError was thrown building StreamBuilder<RealmResultsChanges<Item>>(dirty, state:_StreamBuilderBaseState<RealmResultsChanges<Item>, AsyncSnapshot<RealmResultsChanges<Item>>>#387c4):RangeError (index): Invalid value: Only valid value is 0: 3  This error can occur with the StreamBuilder widget as the subscription updates. In a production app, you could add error handling. But for the sake of this tutorial, just perform a hot refresh and the error will go away. Now you should see the new Item of High priority that you created. If you want to further test the functionality, you can create Items of various priorities. You will see that a new Item with a lower priority briefly appears in the list of Items and then disappears. Realm creates the Item locally, syncs it with the backend, and then deletes the Item because it doesn't meet the subscription rules. This is called a compensating write. You'll note, too, that the document you initially created is not synced, because it has a priority of null. If you want this Item to be synced, you can edit the document in the Atlas UI and add a value for the priority field, or you can change your subscription to include documents with null values.

Join the Community \nOVERVIEW \nEstimated time to complete: 30 minutes In this tutorial, you will use Atlas App Services to build a serverless application that monitors GitHub repositories and tracks contributions. The App Services App that you build will have several features:      * Keep track of users that have contributed to your project in a MongoDB Atlas collection.  * Leave a comment that welcomes new contributors when they open a pull request or file an issue.  * Generate and send a weekly report that summarizes contributions to your repository. After completing this tutorial, you will know how to do the following tasks:  * Write and run serverless functions that handle your App's logic.  * Automate scheduled tasks and respond to changing data with Atlas Triggers.  * Store and access static data, like API keys, in Values.  * Connect to an external service through an API \nPREREQUISITES \nYou need the following before you can begin this tutorial:  * A GitHub repository. The App you build will track contributions to this repository. You can create a new repository for this tutorial or use an existing repo that you have admin access to.  * A MongoDB Atlas cluster. If you don't already have a cluster, sign up for MongoDB Atlas and create one for free. Also note that this tutorial doesn't use the deployment draft workflow. A deployment draft is a collection of App changes that you can deploy or discard as a single unit. Unless you disabled deployment drafts, you may need to save your changes to a draft and then deploy them manually. \nCREATE A NEW APP \nFirst, you need to create an application in App Services. To create the App:  1. Open your Atlas project at cloud.mongodb.com.  2. In the top navigation, click App Services.  3. Click Create a New App.  4. Name the App github-tracker-tutorial.  5. Select your cluster to link it to the new App.  6. Click Create App Service.  \nWELCOME NEW GITHUB CONTRIBUTORS \nWe'll connect the app to your GitHub repository using a GitHub repository webhook. Webhooks let your App know whenever some event, like a new commit or pull request, happens in your repository. Each event runs a serverless function where you can do something in response. For this tutorial, we'll use the GitHub REST API to send a welcome message to contributors whenever they open their first pull request or issue on a repository. \nCREATE AN ENDPOINT \nWebhooks work by sending a request about the event to a URL that your App controls. In your App, you'll need to expose a custom endpoint with a unique URL to receive and handle the webhook requests. To create the endpoint:  1.  In the left navigation menu, click HTTPS Endpoints.  2.  Click Add An Endpoint.  3.  Name the endpoint route /greetNewContributors.  4.  Leave the HTTP method set to POST.  5.  For authorization, choose Require a Secret.  6.  Enter a new secret name and click Create to create a new secret. Then, enter tutorial as the secret value. This requires all incoming requests to include the query parameter secret=tutorial in the request URL.  7.  Create a new Atlas Function for the endpoint and name it endpoints/greetNewContributors.  8.  For now, set up a basic handler that only responds to incoming calls without doing other work. Copy the following code into the Function body:\n     \n     exports = async function greetNewContributors(request, response) {  return response    .setStatusCode(200)    .setBody(\"Successfully received a GitHub webhook event\")}\n     \n       9.

\nUPDATE YOUR ENDPOINT FUNCTION'S AUTHENTICATION SETTINGS \nNow that you've created the endpoint in your App, you need to change the authentication settings for the endpoint's Function so that the GitHub webhook is accepted. To update your Function's authentication settings:  1. In the left navigation menu, click Functions.  2. Find your endpoint Function and select it.  3. Click Settings.  4. Under Authentication, change the authentication method to System.  5. Click Save to deploy the Function. \nCONNECT THE ENDPOINT TO A GITHUB WEBHOOK \nWith your endpoint Function ready to go, you need to set up a webhook in your GitHub repository that sends events to the endpoint. To create the webhook in your repository:  1. Open the repository's settings and select Webhooks in the left navigation menu.  2. Add a new webhook and set the Payload URL to the URL of the endpoint that you just created. The URL will look like one of the following depending on your app's deployment model:\n    \n    \n      3. Set the webhook content type to application/json.  4. Set the Secret to the same secret value you defined for the endpoint: tutorial.  5. Choose to select individual events and configure the webhook to only send events for Issues and Pull requests.  6. Click Add webhook to save the new webhook. To confirm that the webhook succesfully calls your endpoint, check your application logs in App Services for entries with the type Endpoint. You can get there by clicking Logs in the left navigation menu. You can also check the webhook's request logs in GitHub under Recent Deliveries on the webhook's settings page. Each successful request has a green checkmark next to it.  \nGET A GITHUB ACCESS TOKEN \nThe webhook is now set up to send events from GitHub to your endpoint. However, to respond to events in the endpoint with the GitHub API you'll need an access token. This tutorial uses personal access tokens, but you could also set up a GitHub app and use that token instead. To create a personal access token:  1. Open your GitHub user settings (not your repository settings) and select Developer settings in the left navigation menu.  2. In the left navigation menu, select Personal access tokens and then click Generate new token.  3. Configure the token with a descriptive name and a reasonable expiration time. Since this is a tutorial, consider expiring the token after 7 days.  4. Select the repo scope.  5. Click Generate token.  6. Copy the token somewhere secure where you can access it again. GitHub will never show you the token again after this point. \nSTORE THE TOKEN AS A VALUE \nBack in your App, add a new Value to hold the personal access token you just generated. You'll be able to reference the Value from your endpoint without hardcoding the token into your Functions. To create the Value:  1. In the left navigation menu, click Values.  2. Click Create New Value.  3. Name the Value GitHubAccessToken.  4. Leave the type set to Value.  5. Paste the personal access token into the Value's input. The Value must be valid JSON, so make sure you have surrounding quotation marks.  6. Click Save. \nINSTALL THE GITHUB API CLIENT \nThe endpoint will interact with GitHub's REST API to leave comments. You could write and send HTTP requests directly to the API using the built-in context.http client or an external library. However, in this tutorial we use GitHub's official Node.js library called Octokit that wraps the API. Once installed, you'll be able to import the library from any Function in your App. To add the Octokit library to your App:  1. In the left navigation menu, click Functions.  2. Select the Dependencies tab.  3. Click Add Dependency.  4. Enter the package name: @octokit/request.  5. Click Add.  6. Wait for App Services to install the package. The installation should complete in a few seconds, but may take up to a minute. \nWRITE THE ENDPOINT LOGIC \nNow that you have an access token and have installed Octokit, you can update the endpoint Function to actually do something when it receives events. Specifically, the Function should:  * Parse the incoming webhook event  * Log the contribution in MongoDB  * Add a comment through the GitHub API  * Send an informative response back to GitHub To update the Function:  1. In the left navigation menu, click Functions.  2.

 4. Click Save and deploy the endpoint. \nTEST THE ENDPOINT \nThe welcome message endpoint should now be fully set up. To test that it works correctly, open a new issue or pull request on the repository. The endpoint will add a new comment to the thread the first time you do this but won't add a welcome message on subsequent attempts.  GitHub logs repository webhook requests, so you can also check the log entry in GitHub to confirm that everything is working properly. Each request log includes a response message from the endpoint.  \nTIP If you want to reset the test, delete the document with your GitHub username from community.contributions. This lets the App \"forget\" that you've contributed before and it will welcome you on your next contribution. \nGENERATE A WEEKLY COMMUNITY REPORT \nYour App is connected to GitHub, stores information about contributions, and welcomes new contributors. Now we'll extend it to automatically analyze and generate reports for your repository. \nSPECIFY WHICH REPOS SHOULD GENERATE REPORTS \nYour App needs a way to know which repositories it should generate reports for every week. For this tutorial, we'll hardcode the list in a Value. Create a new Value called GitHubProjects that contains an array of objects. Each object specifies the owner and repo name of a GitHub repository. Make sure to include an entry for your repository. values/projects.json [  { \"owner\": \"<GitHub Username>\", \"repo\": \"<Repository Name>\" }]  \nCREATE A FUNCTION THAT GENERATES REPORTS \nA report is a document that summarizes the contributions to a repository for some time period. We'll use a Function to create on-demand reports for a repo. Create a new Function named generateCommunityReport and add the following code: functions/generateCommunityReport.js exports = async function generateCommunityReport({ owner, repo, startDate }) {  // Look up issues and pull requests that had activity  const octokit = require(\"@octokit/request\");  const { data: issuesWithActivity } = await octokit.request(    \"GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues\",    {      headers: {        authorization: `token ${context.values.get(\"GitHubAccessToken\")}`,      },      owner: owner,      repo: repo,      since: startDate,    }  );\n  // Look up users that contributed to the repo  const atlas = context.services.get(\"mongodb-atlas\");  const contributors = atlas.db(\"community\").collection(\"contributors\");  const allContributors = await contributors    .find({      contributions: {        $elemMatch: {          date: { $gt: new Date(startDate) },          owner: owner,          repo: repo,        },      },    })    .toArray();\n  // Keep track of users who made their first contribution  const newContributors = allContributors.filter((c) => {    new Date(c.contributions[0].date) > new Date(startDate);  });\n  // Return a report with the data  return {    owner,    repo,    startDate,    issuesWithActivity,    allContributors,    newContributors,  };};  \nGENERATE AND SAVE REPORTS EVERY WEEK \nThe Function you just created creates a report for a repository on-demand. However, at this point nothing calls the Function and the generated reports are not saved anywhere. To actually use it, we'll create a scheduled Atla Trigger that calls the Function once every week and saves the generated reports in your linked cluster. To create the Trigger:  1.  In the left navigation menu, click Triggers.  2.  Click Add a Trigger.  3.  Choose Scheduled for the Trigger type.  4.  Name the Trigger generateAndSaveCommunityReports  5.  Choose the Advanced schedule type  6.

Update your new Function's authentication settings to match the new Endpoint's Function from earlier in this tutorial. \nSEND REPORT NOTIFICATIONS \nYour App will now automatically generate and save reports every week. However, the reports won't be very useful if nobody sees them. We'll create a database Trigger that listens for new reports and creates a formatted message that you can send to end users.

JWT with Client SDK\n * Examples\n * Walkthrough\n * Prerequisites\n * Procedure\n * Summary \nOVERVIEW \nThe Custom JWT authentication provider allows users to authenticate with an authentication system that is independent from Atlas App Services. The external system must return a signed JSON Web Token that contains a unique ID value for the authenticated user. App Services uses the JWT to identify your application's users and authenticate their requests but does not impose any restrictions on the external authentication system's requirements or authentication methods. For example, the system could require the user to perform two factor authentication, provide specific credentials, or otherwise identify themself.  \nCONFIGURATION   \nAUDIENCE \nThe Audience of a JWT specifies its intended recipient. JWTs describe their audience in the aud claim. By default, App Services expects aud to contain the App ID of the App for which the provider is configured. If the external authentication system JWT specifies a different aud value, then you can configure the provider to use that value instead. You can input a single audience or multiple audiences as a comma-separated list. If you add multiple audiences, a toggle appears containing the following options:      * All of these audiences: the JWT must include every audience in the list.  * Any one of these audiences: the JWT only needs to include one audience from the list.   VERIFICATION METHOD \nThe Verification Method configures how the provider determines which signing algorithm and signing keys the external authentication system must use to sign each JWT. You can either manually specify signing keys or specify a JSON Web Key URI. MANUALLY SPECIFY SIGNING KEYS \nYou can manually configure the signing algorithm and specify one or more signing keys that the external authentication system may use to sign JWTs.  Field\nDescription\nSigning Algorithm\nconfig.signingAlgorithm The cryptographic method that the external system uses to sign the JWT. Custom authentication supports JWTs signed using any of the following algorithms:  * HS256  * RS256 \nSigning Key\nsecret_config.signingKeys A list of the names of up to three Secrets that each contain a signing key used by the external authentication system to sign JWTs. Each signing key Secret must be a string with length between 32 and 512 characters.  \nWARNING A Signing Key is a secret key and anyone with the key can issue valid user credentials for your app. Ensure that it's never stored in a publicly accessible location, such as a git repository, message board, or in your code. USE A JWK URI \nSome external authentication systems provide a JSON Web Key Set that describes the signing algorithm and signing keys the system uses to sign JWTs. You can use the JWKS to configure the provider instead of manually specifying the signing algorithm and keys. When enabled, each token must include a kid header that specifies the Key ID of a key from the JWKS.  Field\nDescription\nUse JWK URI\nconfig.useJWKURI\nIf true, configures App Services to use a signing algorithm and signing keys defined in a JWK or JWKS. The JWKS must be accessible at a URL that you specify.\nJWK URI\nconfig.jwkURI A URL that hosts a JWK or JWKS that describes the signing method and signing keys the JWTs should use. The JWKS may specify up to three signing keys and must use the RS256 algorithm.  \nMETADATA FIELDS \nMetadata Fields are additional data that describe each user. App Services determines the value of each metadata field from the value of some field included in the JWT from the external authentication system. If you set the name field of a user, then App Services will use that field as the user's display name. App Services refreshes a user's metadata whenever they log in and exposes the fields in the data object of the user object. \nIMPORTANT \n2048 CHARACTER LIMIT The length of a JWT token increases with the number of metadata fields in the token and the size of each field.

EXAMPLE An external authentication system returns JWTs that include additional information about each user in the user_data field: {  \"aud\": \"myapp-abcde\",  \"exp\": 1516239022,  \"sub\": \"24601\",  \"user_data\": {    \"name\": \"Jean Valjean\",    \"aliases\": [      \"Monsieur Madeleine\",      \"Ultime Fauchelevent\",      \"Urbain Fabre\"    ]  }}  To include the values from the user_data field in each user's user object, you could specify the following metadata fields: Path\nField Name\nuser_data.name\nname\nuser_data.aliases\naliases We can now access the mapped values directly from the user object, which would resemble the following for the given JWT: {  \"id\": \"59fdd02846244cdse5369ebf\",  \"type\": \"normal\",  \"data\": {    \"name\": \"Jean Valjean\",    \"aliases\": [      \"Monsieur Madeleine\",      \"Ultime Fauchelevent\",      \"Urbain Fabre\"    ]  },  identities: [    {      \"id\": \"24601\",      \"provider_type\": \"custom-token\",      \"data\": {        \"name\": \"Jean Valjean\",        \"aliases\": [          \"Monsieur Madeleine\",          \"Ultime Fauchelevent\",          \"Urbain Fabre\"        ]      },    }  ]}  \nJSON WEB TOKENS \nThe external authentication system must return a JSON web token that uniquely identifies the authenticated user. JSON web tokens are an industry standard (see RFC 7519) for securely representing claims between two parties. A JWT is a string that consists of three parts: a header, a payload and a signature and has the following form: <header>.<payload>.<signature>  \nJWT HEADER \nThe header portion of the JWT consists of a Base64UrlEncoded document of the following form: {  \"alg\": \"HS256\",  \"typ\": \"JWT\",  \"kid\": \"<JWK Key ID>\"} \nField\nDescription\nalg \nRequired. A string representing the hashing algorithm being used. App Services supports JWTs encoded with the following algorithms: Algorithm\nValue\nHMAC SHA-256\n\"HS256\"\nRSA Signature SHA-256\n\"RS256\" typ Required. The type of the token. App Services expects a JSON web token so the value should be \"JWT\".\nkid Optional. The Key ID of a specific key to use from a set of keys in a JWK. You must include the kid header when you use a JWK URL. \nJWT PAYLOAD \nThe payload portion of the JWT consists of a Base64UrlEncoded document of the following form: {  \"aud\": \"<realm app id>\"

Required. The subject of the token. The value should be a unique ID for the authenticated user from your custom-built authentication system.\nexp \nRequired. The Expiration date of the token. The value should be a NumericDate number indicating the time at which the token expires. \nNOTE App Services will not accept expired authentication tokens. iat Optional. The \"issued at\" date of the token. The value should be a NumericDate number that indicates the time after which the token is considered valid. This field is functionally identical to nbf.\nnbf Optional. The \"not before\" date of the token. The value should be a NumericDate number that indicates the time before which the token is considered invalid. This field is functionally identical to iat. \nNOTE App Services maps certain values from the JWT the user object so that you can access them in your application:  * The required fields listed in this section map to the User.identities.data property for their Custom JWT provider identity.  * The metadata fields listed in the Custom JWT provider configuration map to the User.data property.  * Any optional fields not listed in the provider configuration are ignored and do not map to the user object. \nJWT SIGNATURE \nThe signature portion of the JWT is a hash of the encoded token header and payload. To form the signature, concatenate the encoded header and payload with a period and sign the result with the Signing Key specified in the authentication provider configuration using the hashing algorithm specified in the \"alg\" field of the header. HMACSHA256(  base64UrlEncode(header) + \".\" + base64UrlEncode(payload),  signingKey)  \nFIREBASE JWT AUTHENTICATION \nYou can use the Firebase Authentication service to authenticate users into App Services Apps as well as Firebase apps. Use App Services Custom JWT authentication to access App Services with Firebase credentials. To set up Firebase Authentication as your Custom JWT provider in App Services: 1 \nCONFIGURE FIREBASE AUTHENTICATION \nFollow the official docs to set up Firebase Authentication for your project. 2 \nCONFIGURE APP SERVICES JWT AUTHENTICATION   For more details, refer to the JWT authentication configuration documentation. 3 \nLOG IN TO APP SERVICES USING FIREBASE JWT WITH CLIENT SDK \nNow that you've configured App Services to work with Firebase JWTs, you can log users in using Firebase and Realm SDKs in languages supported by both.  1. Log the user into Firebase. See the relevant Firebase SDK documentation.  2. Retrieve the user's Firebase JWT. See the documentation on using a client Firebase SDK to get a user's JWT.  3. Pass the Firebase JWT to a Realm SDK Custom JWT authentication method. For more information how to use Realm SDKs to perform Custom JWT authentication, refer to Custom JWT Examples. \nEXAMPLES \nFor code examples that demonstrate how to register and log in using Custom JWT authentication, see the documentation for the Realm SDKs:   WALKTHROUGH \nIn this walkthrough, you will implement Custom JWT Authentication for your App Services App. You will learn how to:  * Enable JWT Authentication  * Use a third-party JWT provider to generate a valid token  * Authenticate against the backend from a client application \nPREREQUISITES \nYou can use any App Services App for this tutorial. If you do not have a test app to use, you can create an app or use one of the Template Apps. \nPROCEDURE \nThis procedure is divided into three logical steps:  1. Create a JWT token  2. Enable and configure JWT Authentication in App Services  3. Add authentication code to your client app CREATE A JWT TOKEN \nFor this tutorial, we will use a third-party website, jwt.io, to generate a JWT token. Go to jwt.io. Scroll down until you see the Encoded and Decoded headers. In the Decoded column, you will see three sections that comprise a JWT token: Header, Payload, and Verify Signature areas, each of which is explained in the next sections. HEADER \nThe header of a JWT informs consuming applications what algorithm was used to encode the token.

For more information, see RFC 7519 4.1.2.\n<your email or any other unique value>\nname\nThe name of the user to whom this JWT is assigned. If specified, App Services uses this value as the user's display name. Optional.\n<your name>\niat\n\"Issued At\" is a Unix epoch timestamp of when the token was issued.\nThe current date-time in seconds since Unix epoch.\nexp\nThe date-time when this token will expire.\nA future date-time (in seconds since Unix epoch) for when you want the token to expire. Depending on your business needs, this can be any duration.\naud\nThe audience (consumer) of the token.\nYour App Services App ID, which you can find in the App Services UI. If applicable, you can input multiple App IDs as a comma-separated list. When inputting multiple, you can specify whether the JWT requires all or any one of the listed audiences. For this tutorial, we have created a JWT for a user named \"Caleb\". The token was issued at the time of writing and will expire in exactly 1 year, and is intended to be used by an App Services with an ID of \"boiboi-cul8r\". Our completed JSON payload looks like this: {   \"sub\": \"1234567890\",   \"name\": \"Caleb\",   \"iat\": 1617313420,   \"exp\": 1648849420,   \"aud\": \"boiboi-cul8r\"}  VERIFY SIGNATURE \nThe final step in creating the JWT is to add a 256-bit secret with which the token is encoded. In this last section, find the field with the placeholder text of \"your-256-bit-secret\". Paste in any 256-bit string value into this field. If you are uncertain what value to use, consider visiting a random key generator website, like keygen.io, and copy one of the 256-bit values that has been generated. \nIMPORTANT The key you use must only contain ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens, and must be between 32 and 512 characters long. \nNOTE Keep track of this secret, as you will need it in the next section when we configure App Services authentication. After pasting in your key, check the secret base64 encoded check box. At this point, you have generated a JWT key that can be used with — and only with — the App you specified. Copy this key from the Encoded box and temporarily save it in a text document. Your JWT will be 3 sections of values, separated by periods, and looks something like the following (your token will not match this!): eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9. ⤶eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkNhbGViIiwiaWF0IjoxNjE3MzEzNDIwLCJle ⤶HAiOjE2NDg4NDk0MjAsImF1ZCI6ImJvaWJvaS1jeWFsOHIifQ. ⤶GaIE4e6mGxlIBNnz4FcheFBUmxd25GK-rfOfF6F85rY ENABLE JWT AUTHENTICATION IN YOUR APP \nIf you are not currently logged in to App Services do so now and navigate to the App that you specified when generating the JWT in the previous section.  1.

\nRealm provides a Swift SDK that allows you to create a native iOS mobile application with Swift or Objective-C. This tutorial is based on the SwiftUI Flexible Sync Template App, named swiftui.todo.flex, which illustrates the creation of a to-do list application. This application enables users to:      * Register their email as a new user account.  * Sign in to their account with their email and password (and sign out later).  * View, create, modify, and delete their own tasks.  * View all tasks, even where the user is not the owner. The template app also provides a toggle that simulates the device being in \"Offline Mode.\" This toggle lets you quickly test Device Sync functionality on the simulator, emulating the user having no internet connection. However, you would likely remove this toggle in a production application. This tutorial builds on the Template App. You will add a new priority field to the existing Item model and update the Flexible Sync subscription to only show items within a range of priorities. Depending on your experience with SwiftUI, this tutorial should take around 30 minutes. \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \nThis tutorial illustrates how you might adapt the template app for your own needs. You would not necessarily make this change given the current structure of the template app. In this tutorial, you will learn how to:  * Update a Realm object model with a non-breaking change.  * Update a Device Sync subscription.  * Add a queryable field to the Device Sync configuration on the server to change which data is synchronized. \nTIP If you prefer to get started with your own application rather than follow a guided tutorial, check out the Swift Quick Start. It includes copyable code examples and the essential information that you need to set up an Atlas App Services backend. For a SwiftUI-specific get started experience, refer to the Realm Database with SwiftUI QuickStart. \nPREREQUISITES \n * Ensure that you have the necessary software installed. The Swift SDK requires Xcode version 13.1 or newer.  * This tutorial starts with a Template App. You need an Atlas Account, an API key, and realm-cli to create a Template App.\n   \n   * You can learn more about creating an Atlas account in the Atlas Getting Started documentation. For this tutorial, you need an Atlas account with a free-tier cluster.\n   \n   * You also need an Atlas API key for the MongoDB Cloud account you wish to log in with. You must be a Project Owner to create a Template App using realm-cli.\n   \n   * To learn more about installing realm-cli, see Install realm-cli. After you have installed realm-cli, login using the API key for your Atlas project. \nSTART WITH THE TEMPLATE \nThis tutorial is based on the SwiftUI Flexible Sync Template App named swiftui.todo.flex. We start with the default app and build new features on it. To learn more about the Template Apps, see Template Apps. If you don't already have an Atlas account, sign-up to deploy a Template App.   EXPLORE THE TEMPLATE APP \n1 \nOPEN THE APP \nOpen the frontend client's App.xcodeproj in Xcode. If you downloaded the client as a .zip file or cloned the client GitHub repository, you must manually insert the App Services App ID in the appropriate place in your client. Follow the Configuration instructions in the client README.md to learn where to insert your App ID. 2 \nEXPLORE THE APP STRUCTURE \nTake a few minutes to explore how the project is organized while Swift Package Manager downloads the latest version of the Realm Swift SDK. Within the App directory, you can see a few files worth noting: File\nPurpose\nAppConfig.swift\nThis file contains the logic to read the appId and baseUrl from the Realm.plist.

To learn more about how you can customize your app configuration, see: Connect to an Atlas App Services Backend. This file is also the entrypoint to the SwiftUI app. We pass the realmApp to the ContentView that observes the app state for user authentication state. In this tutorial, you'll be working in the following files: File\nPurpose\nItem.Swift\nThis file, located at the root of the project, defines the Realm object we store in the database.\nCreateItemView.swift\nThis file, located in the Views directory, provides the functionality to add a new item to the list.\nContentView.Swift\nThis file, located in the Views directory, defines the Flexible Sync subscription. 3 \nRUN THE APP \nWithout making any changes to the code, you should be able to run the app in the iOS Simulator or on a physical device. Run the app, register a new user account, and then add a new Item to your todo list. 4 \nCHECK THE BACKEND \nLog in to Atlas App Services. In the Data Services tab, click on Browse Collections. In the list of databases, find and expand the todo database, and then the Item collection. You should see the document you created in this collection. \nMODIFY THE APPLICATION  ADD A NEW PROPERTY \n1 ADD A PROPERTY TO THE MODEL \nNow that you have confirmed everything is working as expected, we can add changes. In this tutorial, we have decided that we want to add a \"priority\" property to each Item so that we can filter Items by their priorities. The priority property uses a PriorityLevel enum to constrain the possible values. To do this, follow these steps:  A. Open the App.xcodeproj in Xcode.  B. Open the Item.swift class file.  C. Add the following property to the Item class:\n    \n    @Persisted var priority: PriorityLevel\n    \n      D. Also add a PriorityLevel PersistableEnum below the Item class:\n    \n    class Item: Object, ObjectKeyIdentifiable {   @Persisted(primaryKey: true) var _id: ObjectId   @Persisted var isComplete = false   @Persisted var summary: String   @Persisted var owner_id: String   @Persisted var priority: PriorityLevel}\n    enum PriorityLevel: Int, PersistableEnum, CaseIterable {   case severe = 0   case high = 1   case medium = 2   case low = 3\n       var description: String {      switch self {      case .severe: return \"Severe\"      case .high: return \"High\"      case .medium: return \"Medium\"      case .low: return \"Low\"      }   }}\n    \n    \n    \n    PersistableEnum is the protocol that marks enum types as persistable directly in Realm. We set the enum's type as Int here instead of String so we can query based on a numeric priority level later. We use a description computed property to display a string representation of the priority in the UI. 2 SET THE PRIORITY WHEN CREATING A NEW ITEM \n A. In the Views directory, go to CreateItemView.swift. Add a new @State property under the existing itemSummary property. For now, set the default value to medium priority:\n    \n    @State var itemSummary = \"\"@State var priority = PriorityLevel.medium\n    \n      B. Now, in the Form body, add a Picker that enables the user to choose which priority level to set on the new Item. Locate the Section that contains the buttons, and insert the following code above it:\n    \n    Section(header: Text(\"Priority\")) {    Picker(selection: $priority, label: Text(\"Set priority\")) {

3 RUN AND TEST \nAt this point, you can run the application again. Log in using the account you created earlier in this tutorial. You will see the one Item you previously created. Add a new Item, and you will see that you can now set the priority. Choose High for the priority and save the Item. Now switch back to the Atlas data page in your browser, and refresh the Item collection. You should now see the new Item with the priority field added and set to 1. The existing Item does not have a priority field.  \nNOTE \nWHY DIDN'T THIS BREAK SYNC? Adding a property to a Realm object is not a breaking change and therefore does not require a client reset. The template app has Development Mode enabled, so changes to the client Realm object are reflected in the server-side schema. For more information, see Development Mode and Update Your Data Model. \nCHANGE THE SUBSCRIPTION \n1 UPDATE THE SUBSCRIPTION \nIn the ContentView.swift file, we create the Flexible Sync subscription that defines which documents we sync with the user's device & account. Look for the let config = user.flexibleSyncConfiguration(initialSubscriptions: variable where we set the initial subscriptions. Within the subscriptions.append() method, you can see that we are currently subscribing to all documents where the owner_id property matches the authenticated user's id. We want to maintain that, but only sync Items that are marked as High or Severe priority. This is why we set the PriorityLevel enum to type Int, where the highest priority (severe) has a value of 0, and the lowest priority (low) has a value of 3. We can make direct comparisons between an Int and the priority property. To do so, update the query statement to include documents where the priority is equal to or less than PriorityLevel.High (or 1), as shown here. We'll also add the reRunOnOpen bool, and set it to true, to force the subscription query to recalculate which documents to sync every time we open the app. let config = user.flexibleSyncConfiguration(initialSubscriptions: { subs in   if let foundSubscription = subs.first(named: Constants.myItems) {      foundSubscription.updateQuery(toType: Item.self, where: {         $0.owner_id == user.id && $0.priority <= PriorityLevel.high      })   } else {      // No subscription - create it      subs.append(QuerySubscription<Item>(name: Constants.myItems) {         $0.owner_id == user.id && $0.priority <= PriorityLevel.high      })   }}, rerunOnOpen: true) \n2 RUN AND TEST \nRun the application again. Log in using the account you created earlier in this tutorial. You would expect the list to change, since we added the reRunOnOpen to force the subscription query to recalculate which documents to sync. If you check the console logs, you will see an entry that looks something like this: 2022-08-08 17:54:24.128249-0400 App[17920:237672] Sync: Connection[2]:Session[2]: Received QUERY_ERROR \"Client provided query with bad syntax:unsupported query for table \"Item\": key \"priority\" is not a queryablefield\" (error_code=300, query_version=3) This message tells us that we have added a field to our subscription without configuring Flexible Sync to use that field. 3 UPDATE FLEXIBLE SYNC ON THE SERVER \n A. Switch back to the Atlas page in your browser. Select the Atlas App Services tab and open the app you are using.  B. In the left-hand navigation, choose Device Sync, and then click OK in the dialog box about Development Mode being enabled.  C. Scroll down to the Select Queryable Fields section. In the dropdown labeled Select or create a queryable field, choose \"priority\". The priority field will be added to the fields shown:\n    \n      D. Save your changes. 4 TEST THE CHANGES \nReturn to your mobile app. Because we added reRunOnOpen, the app should re-sync only the documents that match the Flexible Sync query.

This tutorial is based on the Kotlin Flexible Sync Template App, named kotlin.todo.flex, which illustrates the creation of a To-do Item List management application. This application enables users to:      * Register their email as a new user account.  * Sign in to their account with their email and password (and sign out later).  * View, create, modify, and delete their own tasks.  * View all tasks, even where the user is not the owner. The template app also provides a toggle that simulates the device being in \"Offline Mode.\" This toggle lets you quickly test Device Sync functionality on the simulator, emulating the user having no internet connection. However, you would likely remove this toggle in a production application. This tutorial adds functionality to the Template App. You will add a new Priority field to the existing Item model and update the Flexible Sync subscription to only show items within a range of priorities. This example illustrates how you might adapt the template app for your own needs. Depending on your experience with Kotlin, this tutorial should take around 30 minutes. \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \nThis tutorial illustrates how you might adapt the template app for your own needs. In this tutorial, you will learn how to:  * Update a Realm object model with a non-breaking change.  * Update a Device Sync subscription.  * Add a queryable field to the Device Sync configuration on the server to change which data is synchronized. \nNOTE \nCHECK OUT THE QUICK START If you prefer to get started with your own application rather than follow a guided tutorial, check out the Kotlin Quick Start. It includes copyable code examples and the essential information that you need to set up an Atlas App Services backend. \nPREREQUISITES \n * Android Studio Bumblebee 2021.1.1 or higher.  * JDK 11 or higher.  * Kotlin Plugin for Android Studio, version 1.6.10 or higher.  * An Android Virtual Device (AVD) using a supported CPU architecture.  * This tutorial starts with a Template App. You need an Atlas Account, an API key, and realm-cli to create a Template App.\n   \n   * You can learn more about creating an Atlas account in the Atlas Getting Started documentation. For this tutorial, you need an Atlas account with a free-tier cluster.\n   \n   * You also need an Atlas API key for the MongoDB Cloud account you wish to log in with. You must be a Project Owner to create a Template App using realm-cli.\n   \n   * To learn more about installing realm-cli, see Install realm-cli. After you have installed realm-cli, login using the API key for your Atlas project. \nSTART WITH THE TEMPLATE \nThis tutorial is based on the Kotlin SDK Flexible Sync Template App named kotlin.todo.flex. We start with the default app and build new features on it. To learn more about the Template Apps, see Template Apps. If you don't already have an Atlas account, sign-up to deploy a Template App.   SET UP THE TEMPLATE APP \n1 \nOPEN THE APP \nIn Android Studio, open the kotlin.todo.flex folder located in the frontend folder of the template app. If you downloaded the client as a .zip file or cloned the client GitHub repository, you must manually insert the App Services App ID in the appropriate place in your client. Follow the Configuration instructions in the client README.md to learn where to insert your App ID. 2 \nEXPLORE THE APP STRUCTURE \nTake a few minutes to explore the project organization while Android Studio indexes your project.

In this tutorial, you'll be working in the following files: File\nPurpose\nItem.kt\nLocated in the domain directory. Defines the Realm object we store in the database.\nAddItem.kt\nLocated in the ui/tasks directory. Contains the composable function that defines the layout used when adding an item.\nAddItemViewModel.kt\nLocated in the presentation/tasks directory. The view model that contains business logic and manages state when adding an item.\nSyncRepository.kt\nLocated in the data directory. Repository used to access Realm Sync and defines the Flexible Sync subscription.\nStrings.xml\nLocated in the res/values directory. Defines the text string resources used in the app. 3 \nRUN THE APP \nWithout making any changes to the code, you should be able to run the app on an Android Emulator using Android Studio or on a physical device. Run the app, register a new user account, and then add a new Item to your todo list. 4 \nCHECK THE BACKEND \nLog in to Atlas App Services. In the Data Services tab, click on Browse Collections. In the list of databases, find and expand the todo database, and then the Item collection. You should see the document you created in this collection. \nMODIFY THE APPLICATION \n1 \nADD A NEW PROPERTY TO THE MODEL \nNow that you have confirmed everything is working as expected, we can add changes. In this tutorial, we have decided that we want to add a \"priority\" property to each Item so that we can filter Items by their priority level. The priority property will be mapped to a PriorityLevel enum to constrain the possible values, and we will use the ordinal of each enum to correspond to the priority integer so we can query based on a numeric priority level later. To do this, follow these steps:  A. Within the app/java/com.mongodb.app/domain folder, open the Item class file.  B. Add a PriorityLevel enum to constrain the possible values. Also add a priority property to the Item class, which sets the default priority to 3, indicating that it is a low-priority todo item:\n    \n    domain/Item.kt\n    \n    // ... imports\n       enum class PriorityLevel() {      Severe, // priority 0      High,   // priority 1      Medium, // priority 2      Low     // priority 3   }\n       class Item() : RealmObject {      @PrimaryKey      var _id: ObjectId = ObjectId.create()      var isComplete: Boolean = false      var summary: String = \"\"      var owner_id: String = \"\"      var priority: Int = PriorityLevel.Low.ordinal\n          constructor(ownerId: String = \"\") : this() {         owner_id = ownerId      }\n    // ... equals() and hashCode() functions\n    }\n    \n     2 \nSET THE PRIORITY WHEN CREATING A NEW ITEM \n A. From the ui/tasks folder, open the AddItem.kt file. This file defines the composable functions for the UI that is displayed when a user clicks the '+' button to add a new todo item.  B. First, add the following imports below the package com.mongodb.app:\n    \n    ui/tasks/AddItem.kt\n    \n    import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.fillMaxWidthimport androidx.compose.foundation.layout.paddingimport androidx.compose.material3.DropdownMenuItemimport androidx.compose.material3.ExposedDropdownMenuBoximport androidx.compose.ui.Modifierimport

Log in using the account you created earlier in this tutorial. You will see the one Item you previously created. Add a new Item, and you will see that you can now set the priority. Choose High for the priority and save the Item. Now switch back to the Atlas data page in your browser, and refresh the Item collection. You should now see the new Item with the priority field added and set to 1. The existing Item does not have a priority field.  \nNOTE \nWHY DIDN'T THIS BREAK SYNC? Adding a property to a Realm object is not a breaking change and therefore does not require a client reset. The template app has Development Mode enabled, so changes to the client Realm object are reflected in the server-side schema.

 * MINE: All documents where the ownerId property matches the authenticated user.  * ALL: All documents from all users. We want to update the MINE subscription to only sync Items that are marked as High or Severe priority. As you may recall, the priority field is of type int, where the highest priority (\"Severe\") has a value of 0, and the lowest priority (\"Low\") has a value of 3. We can make direct comparisons between an integer and the priority property. To do so, edit the RQL statement to include documents where the priority is equal to or less than PriorityLevel.High (or 1), as shown here: data/SyncRepository.kt private fun getQuery(realm: Realm, subscriptionType: SubscriptionType): RealmQuery<Item> =   when (subscriptionType) {         SubscriptionType.MINE -> realm.query(\"owner_id == $0 AND priority <= ${PriorityLevel.High.ordinal}\", currentUser.id)         SubscriptionType.ALL -> realm.query()   }  We'll also force the subscription query to recalculate which documents to sync every time we open the app. To do this, find the SyncConfiguration.Builder().initialSubscriptions() function that our application calls on start. First add the reRunOnOpen parameter set to true, then set updateExisting to true, which allows the existing query to be updated. config = SyncConfiguration.Builder(currentUser, setOf(Item::class))   .initialSubscriptions(rerunOnOpen = true) { realm ->       // Subscribe to the active subscriptionType - first time defaults to MINE       val activeSubscriptionType = getActiveSubscriptionType(realm)       add(getQuery(realm, activeSubscriptionType), activeSubscriptionType.name, updateExisting = true)   }   .errorHandler { session: SyncSession, error: SyncException ->       onSyncError.invoke(session, error)   }   .waitForInitialRemoteData()   .build() \n2 RUN AND TEST \nRun the application again. Log in using the account you created earlier in this tutorial. Here, you'll notice an error if you check your logs using Logcat. You will see an entry that looks something like this: io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.exceptions.BadFlexibleSyncQueryException:Client provided query with bad syntax: unsupported query for table\"Item\": key \"priority\" is not a queryable field This message tells us that we have added a field to our subscription without configuring Flexible Sync to use that field. 3 UPDATE FLEXIBLE SYNC ON THE SERVER \n A. Switch back to the Atlas page in your browser. Select the Atlas App Services tab and open the app you are using.  B. In the left-hand navigation, choose Device Sync, and then click OK in the dialog box about Development Mode being enabled.  C. Scroll down to the Select Queryable Fields section. In the dropdown labeled Select or create a queryable field, choose \"priority\". The priority field will be added to the fields shown:\n    \n      D. Save your changes. 4 TEST THE CHANGES \nReturn to your mobile app. After an initial moment when Realm re-syncs the document collection, you will see the new Item of High priority that you created. If you want to test the functionality further, you can create Items of various priorities. You'll note that if you try to add an Item with a priority lower than High, you will get a Toast message indicating you do not have permission. And if you check your logs using Logcat, you will see a message indicating the item was \"added successfully\", followed by a sync error: ERROR \"Client attempted a write that is outside of permissions or queryfilters; it has been reverted\" That's because, in this scenario, Realm creates the Item locally, syncs it with the backend, and then reverts the write because it doesn't meet the subscription rules. You'll note, too, that the document you initially created is not synced, because it has a priority of null.

This tutorial walks you through how to build your own app that uses Flexible Sync. For this tutorial, we'll start with a pre-built TypeScript template application to see how everything fits together. The app is a pre-built template that includes a working React Native application (frontend) and its corresponding App Services App configuration files (backend). The template app is a basic to-do list application that lets users do various things to manage their tasks:      * Create email/password accounts and log in and out of the app.  * Create, read, update, and delete their own tasks.  * View all tasks, even if the user is not the owner. After you've got the template app running, you will add a new priority field to the existing Item model and update the Flexible Sync subscription to only show items within a range of priorities. This example illustrates how you might adapt the template app for your own needs. You would not necessarily make this change given the current structure of the template app. The template app provides a toggle that simulates the device being in an offline mode. This toggle lets you quickly test Device Sync functionality, emulating the user having no internet connection. However, you would likely remove this toggle in a production application. This tutorial should take around 30 minutes. \nNOTE \nCHECK OUT THE QUICK START If you prefer to explore on your own rather than follow a guided tutorial, check out the React Native Quick Start. It includes copyable code examples and the essential information that you need to set up a React Native app with Atlas Device Sync. \nPREREQUISITES \n * You must set up your local environment for React Native development before you can begin this tutorial. For detailed instructions, see Setting up the development environment in the React Native docs.  * This tutorial starts with a Template App. You need an Atlas Account, an API key, and realm-cli to create a Template App.\n   \n   * You can learn more about creating an Atlas account in the Atlas Getting Started documentation. For this tutorial, you need an Atlas account with a free-tier cluster.\n   \n   * You also need an Atlas API key for the MongoDB Cloud account you wish to log in with. You must be a Project Owner to create a Template App using realm-cli.\n   \n   * To learn more about installing realm-cli, see Install realm-cli. After you have installed realm-cli, login using the API key for your Atlas project. \nSTART WITH THE TEMPLATE APP \nThis tutorial is based on the React Native SDK Flexible Sync Template App named react-native.todo.flex. We start with the default app and build new features on it. To learn more about the Template Apps, see Template Apps. If you don't already have an Atlas account, sign-up to deploy a Template App.   SET UP THE TEMPLATE APP \nUse the following steps to get the template app up and running on your computer: 1 \nINSTALL DEPENDENCIES \nIn your terminal, go to the directory that contains the client code. If you created the app with the App Services CLI, go to realm-sync-tutorial/frontend/react-native.todo.flex. Otherwise, go to the root of your downloaded or cloned project.

3 \nTEST THE APP \nWhen the build completes, you should have a functional app running on your simulator. In the app, register a new account and test the features:  * Add a few to-do items to the list.  * Press the checkbox on one or two items to mark them as complete.  * Press the X on an item to delete it from the list.  * Toggle internet connectivity in the app to simulate offline mode. If you connect to your Atlas Cluster and query the todo.Item collection you can see your App's data. As long as the React Native app is not in offline mode, new data and changes in the app automatically sync to the todo.Item collection. \nTIP To learn how to connect to your Atlas Cluster, see Connect to a Database Deployment. Similarly, any changes in the collection automatically sync down to the React Native app. Try changing an item's completion status in your cluster - the React Native app will automatically update with the new value whenever a network connection is available. \nTIP To learn more about updating data in your cluster, see Update Documents. \nGET FAMILIAR WITH THE TEMPLATE APP \nNow that you have the template app running let's dive into the code to see what we're working with. \nATLAS APP SERVICES APP \nThe template app includes a fully configured App Services App in the backend directory. It has a unique app_id value in realm_config.json that client applications use to connect. It also includes the following pre-defined configurations:  * A data source linked to your Atlas Cluster.  * A data model for the todo.Item collection that matches the Item class in the React Native app.  * An authentication provider that lets users register for and log in to your app with an email and password.  * A flexible sync configuration with a single session role that allows users to read and write their own items and view other users' items. \nREACT NATIVE APP \nThe React Native app is a fully configured mobile client that can run on iOS and Android devices. The app uses the official @realm/react library. The library includes React hooks and components that let you connect to your Atlas App, read and write data, and automatically sync changes from other devices. The app contains some configuration files and directories, but you can ignore those unless you want to customize the app. For this tutorial, you'll want to be familiar with the React components in the src/ directory: File Name\nDescription\nItemSchema.tsx\nThe Item class, including its object data model. We import this class in RealmContext.ts to include it in the app's overall Realm schema.\nRealmContext.ts\nThe Realm hooks and providers that we create and export to work with Realm throughout the app.\nApp.tsx\nThe root component of the app, which we wrap with the Realm hook providers from RealmContext.ts.\nWelcomeView.tsx\nThe user registration and login form that users see when they first open the app.\nItemListView.tsx\nThe main to-do list app that users interact with after they log in. It queries for Item Realm objects and displays them in a list. It also includes the code to create new Item objects and store them in Realm.\nCreateToDoPrompt.tsx\nA UI form that lets us enter data for new Item objects. The code that actually creates new objects is in ItemListView.tsx.\nLogoutButton.tsx\nA reusable button that logs out an authenticated user.\nOfflineModeButton.tsx\nA reusable button that simulates an offline mode by pausing and resuming the current Realm syncSession. \nADD A PRIORITY LEVEL FIELD \nNow that you're more familiar with what's already provided in the template app, let's write some code to implement a new feature. For this tutorial, we'll add a new priority property to the Item objects. This will let us organize to-dos by how important they are and allow us to focus only on the most important ones. 1 \nDEFINE THE PRIORITY LEVELS \nWe want to allow a small number of named priority levels, and we want to easily be able sort the levels. To do this, we'll use a helper function to define an enum object that maps a set of ordered level names to and from an integer that represents their priority. Add the following code directly under the import statements in src/ItemSchema.tsx: function createEnum(arr) {  arr.forEach((p, i) => arr[p] = i);  return arr;}// Priority.High === 1//

2 \nUPDATE THE ITEM DATA MODEL \nNow we have an enum that defines the possible values of the priority field. However, we still have to define the priority field in the Item class. Add the following lines to your code in src/ItemSchema.tsx to add priority to the Item data model: src/ItemSchema.tsx export class Item extends Realm.Object<Item> {  _id!: BSON.ObjectId;  isComplete!: boolean;  summary!: string;  owner_id!: string;  priority!: string;\n  static schema: Realm.ObjectSchema = {    name: 'Item',    primaryKey: '_id',    properties: {      // This allows us to automatically generate a unique _id for each Item      _id: {type: 'objectId', default: () => new BSON.ObjectId()},      // All todo items will default to incomplete      isComplete: {type: 'bool', default: false},      summary: 'string',      owner_id: 'string',      priority: {        // Store the index value of the Priority enum rather than the name        type: 'int',        default: Priority.High      },    },  };}  \nNOTE \nWHY DIDN'T THIS BREAK SYNC At this point, your React Native Item model and its corresponding schema in your App Services App no longer agree. That's okay! Adding a property to a Realm object is not a breaking change and therefore does not require a client reset. The template app has Development Mode enabled, so changes to the client Realm object are reflected in the server-side schema. For more information, see Development Mode and Update Your Data Model. 3 \nADD A PRIORITY PICKER \nYour app's data model now includes a priority for each Item object. Let's update the app UI so that you can choose a priority value when you add a new to-do to the list. First, we'll install an external library to implement the priority picker component. Run the following in your terminal inside of your project root: npm install @react-native-picker/picker  If you're building for iOS, make sure to link the associated Cocoapods after you've installed the package: npx pod-install  \nTIP You may need to rebuild your app after installing. To do so, stop the bundler for your project and then run the build command:  \nNow that the package is fully installed, let's update the new to-do creation prompt component to use the picker. Add the following imports to the top of src/CreateToDoPrompt.tsx: import {Picker} from '@react-native-picker/picker';import {Priority} from './ItemSchema';  Then, modify the CreateToDoPrompt component:  * Add priority to the onSubmit() props definition  * Keep track of priority in a state hook  * Connect the state to the Picker component that you imported  * Pass priority to the

Add some new to-do items to confirm that you can choose a priority level and that the list displays each to-do's priority. \nUPDATE THE SYNC SUBSCRIPTION \nThe Device Sync protocol uses a flexible model where each sync client uses a standard RQL query to choose a subset of application data and then subscribes to the subset. This automatically pulls the latest version of all data in the subset to the device and syncs changes to the data between devices. For example, the template app you're using has the following built-in subscription to items that the current user owns: src/ItemListView.tsx realm.subscriptions.update(mutableSubs => {  mutableSubs.removeByName(itemSubscriptionName);  mutableSubs.add(    realm.objects(Item).filtered(`owner_id == \"${user?.id}\"`),    {name: ownItemsSubscriptionName},  );});  You can customize the subscription during runtime to sync only the data that your app needs. Let's add a feature to demonstrate how. For this tutorial, we'll add a button that lets us toggle between two modes: one where the app syncs all to-do items and another where it only syncs important ones with a priority of High or Severe. 1 \nADD A MODE TOGGLE TO THE UI \nFirst, add a useState() hook to the ItemListView component to keep track of the current mode: ItemListView.tsx const [showImportantOnly, setShowImportantOnly] =

\n2 \nUPDATE THE SYNC SUBSCRIPTION \nAt this point, the app can switch modes in the UI, but we haven't done anything else so the modes are functionally identical. Let's update the sync subscription to only sync data relevant to the current mode. In the first useEffect of the ItemListView component, add code that checks the current mode and appends an additional priority filter to the query if the showImportantOnly mode is active: src/ItemListView.tsx useEffect(() => {  if (showAllItems) {    realm.subscriptions.update(mutableSubs => {      mutableSubs.removeByName(ownItemsSubscriptionName);      mutableSubs.add(realm.objects(Item), {name: itemSubscriptionName});    });  } else if (showImportantOnly) {    realm.subscriptions.update(mutableSubs => {      mutableSubs.removeByName(itemSubscriptionName);      mutableSubs.add(        realm.objects(Item).filtered(`owner_id == \"${user?.id}\" && priority <= 1`),        {name: ownItemsSubscriptionName},      );    });  } else {    realm.subscriptions.update(mutableSubs => {      mutableSubs.removeByName(itemSubscriptionName);      mutableSubs.add(        realm.objects(Item).filtered(`owner_id == \"${user?.id}\"`),        {name: ownItemsSubscriptionName},      );    });  }}, [realm, user, showAllItems, showImportantOnly]);  \nIMPORTANT Don't forget to add showImportantOnly to the list of dependencies in the second argument of useEffect. 3 \nTEST THE APP \nYour app is now set up to modify its sync subscription based on the current mode. However, if you run the app and switch to only showing important items, you'll see that the list doesn't change and a warning appears in the console: Possible Unhandled Promise Rejection (id: 0):Error: Client provided query with bad syntax:unsupported query for table \"Item\": key \"priority\" is not a queryable field 4 \nUPDATE THE SYNC CONFIGURATION \nWe're getting a warning because a sync client can only filter a subscription based on a given field if that field is specifically listed as a queryable field in the Device Sync configuration of your App Services App. To get everything working, we need to add priority as a queryable field in the App's sync configuration. First, find the template app's backend directory and modify sync/config.json: {    ...,    \"queryable_fields_names\": [        \"_id\",        \"owner_id\",        \"priority\"    ]}  Then, run the following terminal command from within the backend directory to deploy the updated sync configuration: npx mongodb-realm-cli push \n5 \nRUN THE COMPLETED APP \nOnce your updated sync configuration is deployed, your app is complete and fully functional. Congratulations! Rebuild and run the app to make sure everything works. You should be able to create, complete, and delete to-do items as well as toggle between viewing all items and only important items. \nWHAT'S NEXT? \n * Read our React Native SDK documentation.  * Find developer-oriented blog posts and integration tutorials on the MongoDB Developer Hub.  * Join the MongoDB Community forum to learn from other MongoDB developers and technical experts. \nNOTE \nSHARE FEEDBACK How did it go?

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nGET STARTED WITH ATLAS DEVICE SYNC \nOn this page    \n * Before You Start\n   \n * Configure Your Data Model\n * Choose an SDK\n * Define Data Model\n * Define Data Access Patterns\n * Choose a Sync Mode\n * Define Data Access Rules\n * Enable Sync\n * Optimize Sync Data Usage\n * Create Queries in Your Client Application To sync data across devices, you enable Device Sync for your App and then use the sync-related methods and properties in the SDKs. \nTIP \nCHECK OUT THE TUTORIAL If you prefer to learn by example, check out the App Services tutorial, which describes how to build a synced to-do list application with clients for common platforms that App Services supports. \nBEFORE YOU START \n     * If you don't already have one, sign up for a free MongoDB Atlas account.  * Flexible Sync requires MongoDB version 5.0 or later. You can use a free shared M0 cluster to explore and develop your app. We recommend that you use a dedicated tier cluster (M10 and above) for production applications. You cannot use sync with a serverless instance or Federated database instance. Partition-Based Sync, requires a MongoDB Atlas cluster that runs MongoDB version 4.4 or later.  * If you don't already have one, create a new App linked to your Atlas cluster. \nCONFIGURE YOUR DATA MODEL  CHOOSE AN SDK \nRealm is an object database optimized for mobile use cases. The Realm SDKs, available for multiple languages and platforms, include everything you need to work with synced \"realms\" in your client code. You can use multiple SDKs to work with the same set of synced data across devices and platforms. This guide focuses on configuring sync with an SDK. For in-depth documentation that includes details on how to install and use the Realm SDKs more generally, check out the SDK docs:  * C++ SDK (Alpha)  * Flutter SDK  * Java SDK  * Kotlin SDK  * .NET SDK  * Node.js SDK  * React Native SDK  * Swift SDK \nNOTE The Realm Web SDK does not currently support Realm Database or Atlas Device Sync. However, you can query the same data in an Atlas cluster using either MongoDB Data Access or the GraphQL API. \nDEFINE DATA MODEL \nA synced realm uses object models that you define to determine the type of objects in the realm. Additionally, Sync requires a server-side document schema for each synced object type so that App Services can translate and apply changes between synced realms and MongoDB Atlas. To define your synced object models, do one of the following for each object type:  * Sync object models from an SDK: In Development Mode, App Services automatically generates a document schema for each synced object type and assigns that schema to a collection in the linked cluster with the same name as the object type. Development mode lets you configure your synced data model from a client application using the same object models and code that you use in your production app. This is useful if you prefer a client-first approach that uses idiomatic object models in your preferred programming language.\n   \n   For a walkthrough of how to turn on Development Mode, see Enable Development Mode.  * Generate object models from a document schema: App Services can automatically generate language-specific object models that you can use in your client applications. The generated models match the document schemas defined for your app's synced cluster. You can define these schemas manually or App Services can sample existing data in the cluster to create them automatically. This is useful if you prefer a server-first approach and/or plan to build apps with multiple SDKs.\n   \n   For a walkthrough of how to generate your object models based on server-side document schemas, see Generate SDK Object Models.\n   \n   Once you have the generated object models, you can copy them directly into your client application and use them the same way you would any regular object or struct in your preferred programming language. \nDEFINE DATA ACCESS PATTERNS \nOnce you have decided on your app's data model, you can define a data access pattern and access rules for your app's data. \nCHOOSE A SYNC MODE \nThere are two Sync Modes: Flexible Sync and the older Partition-Based Sync. We recommend you use Flexible Sync. Client applications can query the queryable fields of a document to determine which objects to sync.

Resolution\n * Summary \nOVERVIEW \nConflicts arise when two or more users make changes to the same piece of data independently. This can happen due to latency between device and server or loss of connectivity. In this event, Atlas Device Sync automatically uses conflict resolution strategies to merge the changes. Specifically, Device Sync handles conflict resolution using operational transformation, a set of rules that guarantee strong eventual consistency, meaning all clients' versions will eventually converge to identical states. This will be true even if changes were made in a different order. You must be aware of the rules to ensure consistent results, but the upside is that by following those rules, you can have devices work entirely offline and still converge on meaningful results when they meet. \nRULES OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION \nAt a very high level, the rules are as follows: Deletes always win.If one side deletes an object it will always stay deleted, even if the other side has made changes to it later on.Last update wins.If two sides update the same property, Device Sync will keep the value from the most recent update.Inserts in lists are ordered by time.If two items are inserted at the same position, the item that was inserted first will end up before the other item. This means that if both sides append items to the end of a list, will include both items in order of insertion time.Primary keys designate object identity.If two sides both create objects of the same class with identical primary keys, they will be treated as instances of the same object. \nEXAMPLE \nCONFLICT RESOLUTION EXAMPLE Matt and Sarah are working on data for their dog walking business. Matt deletes data on one of their client's dogs, Doug, as they no longer need to walk him. While Sarah is out without internet connection, she edits Doug's required walk time data on her local, offline version, as she does not know about Matt's deletion of Doug's data. Once Sarah regains internet connection, her change will be sent to the server. The server will send her Matt's deletion operation. As deletes always win according to Device Sync's conflict resolution rules, Matt's deletion is kept rather than Sarah's edit. The server will not send Sarah's edits to Matt's device. The data is again in agreement across Matt and Sarah's devices. \nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS  COUNTERS \nUsing integers for counting is a special case. The way that most programming languages would implement an increment operation (like v += 1) is to read the value, increment the result, and then store it back. This will obviously not work if you have multiple parties doing incrementing simultaneously (they may both read 10, increment it to 11, and when it merged you would get a result of 11 rather than the intended 12). To support this common case, we offer a way to express whether you are incrementing (or decrementing) the value, giving enough hints so the merge can reach the correct result. You have the choice to update the entire value or edit it in a way that conveys more meaning, allowing you to get more precise control of the conflict resolution. \nSTRINGS \nDevice Sync interprets the value of a string as a whole and does not merge conflicts on a per-character basis. For example, this means that if a character or substring is inserted or deleted within a string, Device Sync will treat this as a replacement of the entire value of the string. \nCUSTOM CONFLICT RESOLUTION \nGenerally speaking, the conflict resolution of Device Sync should work for most purposes, and you should not need to customize it. That said, the typical way to do custom conflict resolution is to change a property type from string to list. Each side can then add its updates to the list and apply any conflict resolution rules it wants directly in the data model. You can use this technique to implement max, min, first write wins, last write wins, or any other kind of resolution you can think of. \nSUMMARY \n     * Device Sync implements a conflict resolution system to allow multiple offline writers to write simultaneously and still eventually converge on the same result.  * The conflict resolution system follows four rules: deletes always win, the last update wins, inserts in lists are ordered by time, and primary keys designate object identity.  * Counters and strings are special cases to be aware of in your client code. ←  Technical DetailsAtlas

Offline Time\n * Key Concepts\n * Client Maximum Offline Time Does Not Immediately Influence Client Resets\n * Set the Client Maximum Offline Time\n * Optimizing Performance and Storage When Using Flexible Sync\n * Summary \nOVERVIEW \nAtlas Device Sync uses space in your app's synced Atlas cluster to store utility data for sync. This includes a history of changes to each realm. Atlas App Services minimizes that space usage via backend compaction, which runs automatically. You can optimize further by specifying a client maximum offline time, which enables advanced backend compaction. \nHISTORY \nThe App Services backend keeps a history of changes to underlying data for each realm, similar to the MongoDB oplog. App Services uses this history to synchronize data between the backend and clients. App Services stores history in your synced Atlas cluster. \nBACKEND COMPACTION \nBackend compaction is a maintenance process that automatically runs for all Apps. During compaction, the backend optimizes a realm's history by removing unneeded changesets. The process removes any instruction whose effect is later overwritten by a newer instruction. \nNOTE Flexible Sync uses trimming instead of backend compaction. \nEXAMPLE Consider the following realm history: Original History CREATE table1.object1UPDATE table1.object1.x = 4UPDATE table1.object1.x = 10UPDATE table1.object1.x = 42  The following history would also converge to the same state, but without unneeded interim changes: Compacted History CREATE table1.object1UPDATE table1.object1.x = 42  Backend compaction:      * reduces space usage in your Atlas cluster, since your history contains fewer instructions.  * reduces the time and data usage of sync, since clients can converge on the same result with fewer instructions. Backend compaction runs regularly on all synced clusters as part of Device Sync. \nADVANCED BACKEND COMPACTION \nAdvanced backend compaction uses client sync states to further optimize a changeset. However, this optimization can prevent convergence for clients that have only seen a subset of history. As a result, advanced backend compaction only occurs for history older than the client maximum offline time. \nEXAMPLE Consider the following realm history: Original History CREATE table2.object2CREATE table1.object1DELETE table2.object2  Because there is a gap in time between the CREATE and DELETE operations for table2.object2, a client could have synchronized the CREATE, but not the DELETE. As a result, compaction can remove the CREATE, but not the DELETE: Compacted History CREATE table1.object1DELETE table2.object2  This guarantees client convergence. If the history didn't include the DELETE, clients that synced the CREATE would never delete table2.object2, but other clients would never create that object in the first place. Instead, all clients get a command to delete that object, and any clients who never created table2.object2 in the first place ignore the DELETE. The following history uses advanced backend compaction to converge on the same state with even fewer steps: Advanced Compacted History CREATE table1.obj1  Because table2.object2 was deleted, it has no impact on the end state of the realm. As a result, advanced backend compaction can completely remove both the CREATE and the DELETE operations for table2.object2 from history. However, any clients that synchronized the CREATE operation but not the DELETE operation will not be able to converge to a common end state. Advanced backend compaction only runs on Apps that specify a client maximum offline time. Only history older than the client maximum offline time experiences advanced backend compaction. \nTRIMMING \nWhen you set a client maximum offline time in an App that uses Flexible Sync, trimming deletes changes older than the client maximum offline time. This reduces storage requirements beyond even the optimization of advanced backend compaction. \nCLIENT MAXIMUM OFFLINE TIME \nThe client maximum offline time controls the age limit of history optimized with advanced backend compaction. This indirectly changes how long a client can remain offline between synchronization sessions with the backend. Clients that do not synchronize for more than the specified number of days may experience a client reset the next time they connect with the backend. The lower the client maximum offline time, the sooner compaction can apply advanced backend compaction to history.

\nWARNING \nCLIENT MAXIMUM OFFLINE TIME CAUSES PERMANENT CHANGES TO HISTORY Client maximum offline time enables advanced backend compaction for older history. This kind of compaction permanently changes affected history, and can cause client resets in the future even after disabling the feature. \nKEY CONCEPTS \nSync should always converge at the same end state on all clients. In order to converge during a sync, clients require the full history of changes beginning immediately after their last sync. When a client does not sync for a long period of time, advanced backend compaction can alter the history in ways that prevent the client from converging. Since synchronization relies on all clients converging on a common result, such a client cannot synchronize. \nEXAMPLE Consider the following example that contains a CREATE and a DELETE for table2.object2: Original History CREATE table2.object2CREATE table1.object1DELETE table2.object2  When this history becomes older than the client maximum offline time, advanced backend compaction optimizes the backend history into the following: Advanced Compacted History CREATE table1.obj1  However, a client contains this subset of history, containing only the CREATE operation for table2.object2: Partial Client History CREATE table2.object2CREATE table1.object1  Since compaction pruned the DELETE operation for table2.object2, the client will never delete that object. The client cannot converge to the same state as the backend and all other clients. As a result, the client must complete a client reset before it can resume synchronization. In a client reset scenario, the client deletes the client-local copy of a realm and downloads the current state of that realm from the backend. Synchronization then resumes using the new copy of the realm. The client maximum offline time controls how long your backend waits before applying advanced backend compaction. After the specified number of days without syncing, clients may experience a client reset the next time they connect with the backend. Applications that do not specify the client maximum offline time never apply advanced backend compaction. This means that clients can connect after any period of time offline -- weeks, months, or even years -- and synchronize changes. As time passes, frequently-edited realms accumulate many changes. With a large changeset, synchronization requires more time and data usage. \nCLIENT MAXIMUM OFFLINE TIME DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY INFLUENCE CLIENT RESETS \nAdvanced backend compaction causes permanent, irreversible changes to history. As a result, increasing the client maximum offline time does not immediately change the length of time before clients experience a client reset. Existing history has already been changed by advanced compaction, requiring a client reset. New history needs time to accumulate up to the new client maximum offline time. Disabling the client maximum offline time feature stops additional advanced backend compaction, but history that has already been changed by advanced compaction will permanently cause client resets in clients. Decreasing client maximum offline time also does not immediately change the length of time before clients experience a client reset. Client resets begin taking place earlier once the regularly scheduled compaction job applies advanced backend compaction to the newly eligible history. \nSET THE CLIENT MAXIMUM OFFLINE TIME   \nOPTIMIZING PERFORMANCE AND STORAGE WHEN USING FLEXIBLE SYNC \nFor Flexible Sync configuration, the amount of Atlas storage space used is directly proportional to the number of queryable fields you have set up. Queryable fields use storage on the backing Atlas cluster. The more queryable fields you configure, the more storage you use on the backing cluster. If you have a large number of collections in an App, you may need to use the same queryable field name across multiple collections. Combine this with permissions for more granular control over who can access which collections. \nEXAMPLE Your app may contain 20 or 30 collections, but you want to minimize the number of queryable fields. You can re-use queryable fields across collections in order to sync objects from every collection. For example, \"owner_id\" might be a field you want to query in multiple collections, but by having the same field name across collections, only one queryable field is used. For best performance, open a synced realm with a broad query. Then, add more refined queries to expose targeted sets of data in the client application. Slicing off working sets from a broad query provides better performance than opening multiple synced realms using more granular queries. When you configure queryable fields, consider the broad queries you use for Sync, and select fewer fields that support those broad queries.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nPAUSE OR TERMINATE SYNC \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Pause Sync\n * Procedure\n * Resume Sync\n * Procedure\n * Terminate Sync\n * Procedure\n * Re-Enable Sync\n * Procedure \nOVERVIEW \nIf you want to disable Atlas Device Sync for your app, you can temporarily pause or permanently terminate it. You can also re-enable Device Sync after disabling it. You can temporarily pause Device Sync if you need to pause your cluster. With a temporary pause, you can resume without resetting your Device Sync configuration or losing Device Sync metadata. You can permanently terminate and re-enable Device Sync for troubleshooting or if you want to change your Device Sync configuration. \nPAUSE SYNC \nYou can pause Device Sync for a period of time without disabling it entirely. When you pause Device Sync, you stop syncing changes between Atlas and your application. \nIMPORTANT If you need to pause your cluster, pause Device Sync first. Otherwise, you must terminate and re-enable Device Sync and perform a client reset. Pausing Device Sync rejects any incoming client connections. This means that pausing Device Sync for your App stops syncing changes for all clients. To pause Device Sync from the client side, using logic that situationally pauses Device Sync during a session, see your preferred SDK:  \nAfter pausing Device Sync, you can re-enable it. Pausing Device Sync maintains the configuration settings and all of the Device Sync metadata, which contains the sync history. When you re-enable paused Device Sync, your clients can reconnect normally. \nWARNING If your oplog rolls past the time that you paused Device Sync, you must terminate and re-enable Device Sync. For example, if you only keep 12 hours of oplog for your cluster, and you pause Device Sync for longer than 12 hours, you must terminate and re-enable Device Sync. Terminating and re-enabling paused Atlas Device Sync for your App erases Atlas Device Sync metadata and requires you to specify configuration settings again. Clients must perform a client reset when they reconnect after Atlas Device Sync has been terminated. For more information, see: Terminate Sync. \nPROCEDURE \n1 PRESS THE PAUSE SYNC BUTTON \nIn the Device Sync tab of the App Services UI, press the Pause Sync button. \n2 CONFIRM THAT YOU WANT TO PAUSE SYNC \nIn the modal that pops up, press the Pause Sync button. \n3 REVIEW YOUR CHANGES \nPress the Review & Deploy button in the blue notification bar telling you that changes have been made to your App Services app. \n4 DEPLOY YOUR APP TO PAUSE SYNC \nIn the model that appears, review your changes and then press the green Deploy button.  You have now paused Device Sync and should get a green notification bar on the top of the Sync page that states that your deployment was successful.  \nRESUME SYNC \nAfter you have paused Device Sync, you can resume it to begin syncing again for all clients. \nWARNING If your oplog rolls past the time that you paused Device Sync, you must terminate and re-enable Device Sync. For example, if you only keep 12 hours of oplog for your cluster, and you pause Device Sync for longer than 12 hours, you must terminate and re-enable Device Sync. Terminating and re-enabling paused Atlas Device Sync for your App erases Atlas Device Sync metadata and requires you to specify configuration settings again. Clients must perform a client reset when they reconnect after Atlas Device Sync has been terminated. For more information, see: Terminate Sync. \nPROCEDURE \nThe process to resume Device Sync is the same as the process to re-enable Device Sync. However, when you pause Device Sync, App Services preserves your configuration settings and Device Sync metadata. To re-enable Device Sync, follow the steps in the Configure and Enable Atlas Device Sync guide. You can skip the Configure Sync step. Clients do not need to perform a client reset when reconnecting after a pause. \nTERMINATE SYNC \nIf you have enabled Device Sync, you may have to terminate and re-enable Device Sync under a few different circumstances:      * An upgrade from a Shared Tier Atlas Cluster to a Shared or Dedicated instance  * A move to an Atlas cluster that is distributed across regions/cloud providers  * An upgrade to NVMe Atlas clusters  * An oplog rollover  * A paused Device Sync session on a shared tier cluster due to infrequent usage  * Troubleshooting, at the request of MongoDB Support  * Altering a Partition-Based Sync configuration  * Switching between Sync modes.

Sync uses a protocol to correctly and efficiently sync data changes in real time across multiple clients that each maintain their own local Realm files. The protocol defines a set of pre-defined request types as well as a process by which a client, like a Realm SDK, can connect to an Atlas App Services application server and sync data. \nNOTE The Realm SDKs internally implement and manage the sync protocol, so for most applications you don't need to understand the sync protocol to use Device Sync. This page covers the protocol at a high level and is not an implementation spec. \nKEY CONCEPTS  CHANGESET \nA changeset is a list of instructions that describe granular modifications made to a known object state or version by one or more write operations. Changesets are the base unit of the sync protocol. Synced realm clients send changesets to the Device Sync server whenever they perform a write operation. The server sends each connected client the changesets for write operations executed by other clients. The Device Sync server accepts changesets from any connected sync client (including changes in a synced MongoDB cluster) at any time and uses an operational transformation algorithm to serialize changes into a linear order and resolve conflicting changesets before sending them to connected clients. \nNOTE \nDELTA SYNC When you make a change to a synced object, App Services does not re-upload the entire object. Instead, App Services sends only the difference (\"delta\") between before and after. The service compresses the deltas with zlib compression. This reduces network load, which is especially useful in mobile network conditions. \nOPERATIONAL TRANSFORMATION \nAn operational transformation is a function that, given two changesets, produces a third changeset that represents logically applying one of the given changesets after the other. Device Sync uses operational transformation to resolve conflicts between changesets from different sync clients that apply to the same base state. Realm is an offline-first local database even when sync is enabled, which means that any device may perform offline writes and upload the corresponding changesets later when network connectivity is re-established. The operational transformation algorithm is designed to gracefully handle changesets that arrive \"out of order\" with respect to the logical server clock such that every synced Realm file converges to the same version of each changed object. \nTIP An operational transformation on Realm changesets is analogous to a rebase operation in Git. \nCLIENT FILE IDENTIFIER \nA client file identifier is a value that uniquely identifies a synced client Realm file and its corresponding server file. The server generates a client file identifier whenever an SDK requests one during its initial sync of a Realm file. Each identifier is a 64-bit, non-zero, positive signed integer strictly less than 2^63. \nNOTE The server guarantees that all identifiers generated on behalf of a particular server file are unique with respect to each other. The server is free to generate identical identifiers for two client files if they are associated with different server files. \nNETWORK SECURITY \nThe SDK synchronizes with the application server over a WebSocket connection secured by HTTPS using TLS 1.3. \nSYNC SESSION PROCESS \nTo initiate, execute, and terminate a Device Sync session, a Realm SDK and application server send and receive a set of protocol-specific requests. The SDK negotiates a WebSocket connection over HTTP and then establishes a sync session by sending BIND and IDENT requests to the server over the WebSocket connection. Once the session is established, the SDK and server send synced changesets for a given Realm file to each other via UPLOAD and DOWNLOAD messages.

1 \nCLIENT CONNECTS TO THE APP SERVER \nThe sync protocol is primarily handled over a WebSocket connection between the SDK and the server. To establish a connection, the SDK sends a handshake HTTP request that includes the following:      * a protocol version  * a WebSocket key  * a valid access token for an authenticated App Services application user The server sends an HTTP 101 Switching Protocols response that specifies a WebSocket connection for the SDK. The rest of the sync protocol occurs over this connection. 2 \nCLIENT INITIATES A SYNC SESSION \nTo begin a sync session, a Realm SDK sends a BIND request to a Device Sync server. The request identifies a specific local Realm Database file to sync and includes a WebSocket connection key that the server will use to open a bidirectional connection to the SDK. If the SDK is attempting to sync a particular Realm Database file for the first time, it does not yet possess a server-generated client identifier for the file. In this case, the BIND request also indicates that the Device Sync server should allocate one. 3 \nAPP SERVICES ALLOCATES A NEW CLIENT FILE IDENTIFIER \nIf a BIND request indicates that the SDK needs a client file identifier, the Device Sync server generates a unique value for the specified Realm Database file and sends it to the SDK in an IDENT response. When the SDK receives the IDENT, it stores the new client identifier persistently in the local Realm Database file. An SDK only needs to request a client file identifier the first time it syncs each Realm Database file. For subsequent sync sessions, the SDK can use the persisted identifier. 4 \nCLIENT SENDS A CLIENT IDENTIFIER \nOnce an SDK has initiated a sync session with a BIND request, it must identify the local Realm Database file that it wants to sync. To do this, the SDK sends the application server an IDENT message that contains the client file identifier. If the SDK has previously synced the realm with the server, it can specify the most recently synced server version to optimize the sync process. When it receives the IDENT message, the server establishes the session. The SDK and server can can now freely send upload and download sync changesets at any time. 5 \nCLIENT UPLOADS & DOWNLOADS SYNC CHANGESETS \nOnce a sync session is established, the SDK and server can freely send and receive UPLOAD and DOWNLOAD messages to sync changes whenever they occur. The SDK sends an UPLOAD message for every changeset it applies except for those that it received in a DOWNLOAD message from the server. When the server receives an UPLOAD message, it applies operational transformations to resolve any conflicts with other changesets and then applies the transformed changeset to the server version of the realm. This triggers the server to send DOWNLOAD messages to other connected clients, including the synced Atlas cluster which mirrors the server realm. A DOWNLOAD message groups one or more transformed changesets in chronological order from oldest to most recent according to the server's history. The SDK applies the changesets in the same order. 6 \nCLIENT TERMINATES THE SYNC SESSION \nOnce a sync session is established, Device Sync servers will continue to accept UPLOAD messages and send DOWNLOAD messages until the SDK terminates the session. To terminate a sync session, an SDK sends an UNBIND request to the Device Sync server. \nREQUEST TYPES  CLIENT -> SERVER MESSAGES \nThe following table describes the request types that a sync client can send to a Device Sync server: Request\nDescription\nBIND \nStarts a new sync session on the server and provides a signed authorization token for the current application user. If the client does not yet possess a client file identifier for the Realm file it wants to sync, this also indicates that the server should generate one and send it back to the client. A client must send a BIND before it can send any other requests. IDENT \nProvides the client file identifier that indicates the following:  * the Realm file to sync  * the client realm's current version  * the client realm's most recently synced server version This request is related to but distinct from the IDENT message sent by the server when a client requests a client file identifier. UPLOAD Specifies one or more changesets for operations that occurred on the client. The changesets are listed by client version in increasing order.\nTRANSACT Specifies a changeset that describes a serialized transaction that occurred on the client. The client may not upload any other changesets until the server confirms or rejects the transaction.\nUNBIND \nEnds a running sync session.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nSYNC SETTINGS \nOn this page    \n * Available Settings\n   \n * Sync Type\n * Development Mode\n * Cluster to Sync\n * Database Name (Development Mode Only)\n * Queryable Fields\n * Permissions\n * Asymmetric Sync\n * Client Max Offline Time\n * Client Recovery\n * Sync Configuration File Reference\n * Sync Config Object This page explains the settings available when you enable or configure Device Sync. \nAVAILABLE SETTINGS  SYNC TYPE \nAtlas Device Sync has two sync modes: Flexible Sync and the older Partition-Based Sync. We recommend using Flexible Sync. For information about Partition-Based Sync, refer to Partition-Based Sync. Flexible Sync lets you define a query in the client and sync only the objects that match the query. With client-side subscriptions, client applications can:      * Maintain queries  * React to changes  * Add, change, or delete queries \nDEVELOPMENT MODE \nDevelopment Mode is a configuration setting that allows Device Sync to infer and update schemas based on client-side data models. This streamlines development, but should not be used in production. Development Mode speeds up development by allowing you to design schemas directly in client application code. When you sync a realm file, Atlas App Services maps every synced object type to its own collection in the database specified by Database Name (Development Mode Only). If you update the object model on the client side, App Services updates the collection schema to match. This lets you update objects in your client code as you develop your app. You can use data access rules with Development Mode. Note that schema changes ignore data access rules. This means that any client can update the backend schema by changing the client model. To learn more about how the Realm Object Schemas map to the App Services Schemas when using Development Mode, refer to Data Model Mapping. For more information about modifying synced object schemas, including how to handle breaking changes, see: Update Your Data Model. \nIMPORTANT \nDISABLE DEVELOPMENT MODE FOR PRODUCTION APPS Development mode is a development utility that is not suitable for production use. Make sure that you turn off Development Mode before you make your app accessible in a production environment. \nCLUSTER TO SYNC \nThe name of the Atlas cluster data source where you want the synced data stored. Flexible Sync requires MongoDB 5.0. You cannot use Sync with a serverless instance. In the UI, clusters display as gray and not-selectable when they do not meet the requirements for Flexible Sync. \nDATABASE NAME (DEVELOPMENT MODE ONLY) \nWhen you enable Development Mode, you specify a database to store synced objects. App Services creates new collections in this Development Mode database for every type of synced object. \nEXAMPLE Specify a Development Mode database of myapp. Your iOS client has a Person model. You sync a realm that contains an instance of the Person object. Development Mode creates a server-side schema associated with the model. The object syncs to the myapp.Person collection. App Services continues creating new server-side schemas and collections for each new object type. If you later add a Dog object, that object will sync to a new myapp.Dog collection that App Services will create. \nQUERYABLE FIELDS \nWhen you configure Flexible Sync, you specify field names that your client application can query. Fields that can be used in a subscription query are called queryable fields. You can automatically specify queryable fields by enabling Development Mode. Development Mode allows App Services to automatically mark fields as queryable as they are used. Queryable fields apply across all collections in an App's Schema. You can use rules and permissions to configure more granular access control on individual collections. The field names you provide are arbitrary strings. If an object type has a field whose name matches a field name you provided (and meets other eligibility criteria), that field becomes available to Device Sync to query. \nEXAMPLE In a to-do list app, you might set assignee or owner as queryable fields. On the client side, you can then query for tasks whose assignee or owner matches the logged-in user. ELIGIBLE FIELD TYPES \nFlexible Sync only supports top-level primitive fields with a scalar type as queryable fields. You can also include arrays of these primitives as queryable fields.

RESERVED FIELD NAMES \nApp Services reserves some keywords for the Realm Query Language and other purposes. You cannot use reserved keywords as field names. App Services reserves the following keywords with any capitalization:  * and  * asc  * ascending  * beginswith  * between  * contains  * desc  * descending  * distinct  * endswith  * falsepredicate  * inf  * infinity  * like  * limit  * nan  * nil  * null  * or  * sort  * subquery  * truepredicate \nEXAMPLE You cannot use descending, Descending, DESCENDING, or DeScEnDiNG as a field name. App Services also reserves the following keywords with the given exact capitalization:  * ALL  * ANY  * B64  * FALSE  * IN  * NONE  * NOT  * SOME  * TRUE  * all  * any  * false  * in  * none  * not  * oid  * some  * true  * uuid \nEXAMPLE You cannot use true or TRUE, since both capitalizations are specifically reserved, but you can use True or tRUE as a field name. PERFORMANCE AND STORAGE \nEach queryable field adds additional metadata storage to your Atlas cluster and may lead to degraded write performance. You should have as few queryable fields as needed by your application. A good rule of thumb is to have at most 10 queryable fields. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: Learn more about optimizing performance and storage when using Flexible Sync. CONSEQUENCES OF ADDING OR REMOVING QUERYABLE FIELDS \nYou can update your Sync configuration to add or remove queryable field names, but be aware of the following: When you add a queryable field, devices can only sync on that field once the device has caught up to the point in time in Device Sync History where the field was added. When you remove a queryable field, any devices still using that field will have their Device Sync session dropped and must perform a client reset. Clients not using the removed field won't receive any errors. To avoid triggering a client reset when you remove the queryable field, you should first remove usage of that field on the client-side. \nPERMISSIONS \nAtlas Device Sync enforces role-based data access rules for all requests to a synced cluster. Rules are dynamic JSON expressions that determine a user's ability to sync, view, and modify data. For details, see Role-based Permissions. \nASYMMETRIC SYNC \nAsymmetric Sync is a sync strategy for applications with heavy client-side insert-only workloads. You can enable it for one or more collections. It supports writing to any collection type, including an Atlas time-series collection. For example, an IoT app that frequently logs sensor data has a significant write workload and no read workload. The device may also be offline for extended periods of time. Asymmetric Sync bypasses some of the processing required for bi-directional sync, significantly improving write speed to an Atlas collection. Other use cases include writing immutable data, such as invoices from a retail app, or logging application events, neither of which requires conflict resolution. You can apply Asymmetric Sync to individual collections. This means your app can use Asymmetric Sync to write some data, but bi-directional Flexible Sync on other collections. Asymmetric Sync collections are only for writing data. You cannot use Flexible Sync queries against these collections. Instead, use Connect to MongoDB Data Sources. After you have enabled Asymmetric Sync, you implement it in the client app via the client SDKs. Currently, the following Realm SDKs support Asymmetric Sync:  * C++ SDK: Stream Data to Atlas - C++ SDK (Alpha)  * .NET SDK: Unidirectional Data Sync - .NET SDK  * Node.js SDK: Define an Asymmetric Object  * React Native SDK: Define an Asymmetric Object - React Native SDK  * Swift SDK: Stream Data to Atlas - Swift SDK \nCLIENT MAX OFFLINE TIME \nClient Maximum Offline Time determines how long the client can be offline between sync sessions. Changing this value enables you to balance offline access with storage used in the synced Atlas cluster. For more information, refer to Client Maximum Offline Time. \nCLIENT RECOVERY \nClient Recovery enables the client to attempt to automatically perform a client reset while recovering data on the device. For more information, refer to Recover Unsynced Changes. \nSYNC CONFIGURATION FILE REFERENCE \nYou can find the Sync configuration file for your application in the sync directory of an exported app: app/└── sync/    └── config.json  For example, the following Sync configuration applies to apps using Flexible Sync (recommended).

Examples\n * Enable or Disable Recovery Mode \nOVERVIEW \nA client reset error is a scenario where a client realm cannot sync data with the application backend. Clients in this state may continue to run and save data locally but cannot send or receive sync changesets until they perform a client reset. The Realm SDKs provide methods to automatically handle client resets under most scenarios. \nWARNING By default, the client reset process attempts to recover unsynced changes that were successfully saved locally. When your client application has breaking schema changes, or if Recovery Mode is disabled on the server, the client reset process cannot recover unsynced data that may be persisted locally on the device. Client reset scenarios occur when the server's history is incompatible with the client's history. The most common causes of client resets are:      * Atlas App Services server crashes: A server may restore from a backup that has an earlier version. A client reset for this scenario would reset the client to the earlier version and lose any changes that were saved on the client but not yet synced with the server.  * Disabling and re-enabling sync: Turning Sync off and then on again in the App Services UI causes all clients to require a client reset.  * Client/Backend schema mismatch: If a client application attempts to synchronize with the backend while using a Realm Object schema that does not exist in the backend, that client must perform a client reset. This only applies in one direction: if the backend schema contains an Realm Object class not used in a client, that client does not need to client reset.  * Client maximum offline time: When a client has not synchronized with the backend in more than client maximum offline time days, that client can no longer synchronize unsynced local changes with the backend. The client must discard all local changes since the last sync and download the current status of the realm from the backend.  * Breaking schema changes: A breaking or destructive change, like changing a property type or a primary key, requires you to terminate and re-enable Sync. This creates a new synced realm file with a version unrelated to the client's file. In this scenario, the client reset process cannot complete automatically, and your app must provide a manual client reset handler.  * Upgrading from a Shared to Dedicated cluster: When you upgrade from a shared to a dedicated cluster, you must terminate Sync on the old cluster. After you upgrade, you can re-enable Sync. Turning Sync off and then on again causes all clients to require a client reset.  * Session role changes: When using Flexible Sync, changes to a user's Flexible Sync session role result in a client reset. The following scenarios all result in a client reset:\n   \n   * server-side modifications to the session role\n   \n   * changes to the value of any expansions in the \"apply when\", read, or write expressions\n   \n   * changes that qualify the user for a different session role\n   \n   \n   NOTE\n   \n   \n   BREAKING SCHEMA CHANGES REQUIRE AN APP SCHEMA UPDATE\n   \n   After a breaking schema change:\n   \n    * All clients must perform a manual client reset.\n   \n    * You must update client models affected by the breaking schema change. \nHANDLE A CLIENT RESET \nThe SDKs automatically detect the need for client resets. They can automatically perform a client reset in most cases, except in the event of a breaking schema change. During an automatic client reset, the client:  1. Downloads a fresh copy of the realm from the backend.  2.

Asymmetric Sync\n * Enable an Authentication Provider\n * Add Sync to the Client Application\n * Connect the client to an App Services backend\n * Authenticate a User\n * Open a Synced Realm\n * Create Asymmetric Objects and Write Data If you have a mobile or client application that produces a large volume of data you'd like to stream to MongoDB Atlas, you can sync data unidirectionally using Device Sync. We call the feature that enables this unidirectional sync Asymmetric Sync. You might want to sync data unidirectionally in IoT applications, such as a weather sensor sending data to the cloud. Asymmetric sync is also useful for writing other types of immutable data where you do not require conflict resolution, such as creating invoices from a retail app or logging application events. Asymmetric Sync is optimized to provide performance improvements for heavy client-side insert-only workloads. You cannot read this data from the realm where you're streaming it. Follow these high-level steps to get started: \nSET UP ATLAS ACCESS \n1 \nCREATE AN ATLAS APP SERVICES APP \nThe App Services application is the gateway that enables your client device to connect to MongoDB Atlas. When you create an App, you name it, link it to an Atlas cluster, and specify the deployment model and deployment region that work best for your application. To learn how to create an App Services App, see Create an App. 2 \nCONFIGURE DEVICE SYNC AND ASYMMETRIC SYNC \nDevice Sync is the service that synchronizes data to Atlas and across your client devices. Device Sync, together with the Realm SDKs, automatically manages network connectivity, user permissions, and conflict resolution. The App Services app provides the built-in user authentication that Device Sync and the Realm SDKs leverage to secure your data. When you configure Device Sync, you specify the data source that the client devices can access as well as the permissions that determine what data a user can write. You can configure Device Sync via the Atlas UI, the Atlas App Services Command Line Interface, or the App Services Admin API. The first time you configure Device Sync, you may find it helpful to use the Atlas UI as it provides links and information about various settings and options. To enable Asymmetric Sync for one or more collections, you select the collection or collections in the Advanced Configuration section of your Device Sync configuration. Only collections with an App Services Schema are available to select in this drop-down. If you have not yet created a schema for the collection that you want to sync unidirectionally, you can either:      * Generate an App Services schema from your Realm object model. Refer to: Create an App Services Schema from a Realm Object Model.  * Manually create an App Services Schema. For more information, refer to: Enforce a Schema. 3 \nENABLE AN AUTHENTICATION PROVIDER \nYour client devices must authenticate in order to access synced data. App Services provides several authentication providers, such as email/password or anonymous authentication, to enable your users to authenticate. Configure one or more of these authentication providers to enable authentication in your client application. You can configure authentication providers within the App Services App UI by selecting Authentication in the left navigation menu, and then click a provider to configure it. You can also configure authentication providers by editing the App Services configuration with the Atlas App Services Command Line Interface, or the App Services Admin API. \nADD SYNC TO THE CLIENT APPLICATION \nAfter this, you've got everything set up that you need on the Atlas side, and you can prepare your client application to sync data unidirectionally. 1 \nCONNECT THE CLIENT TO AN APP SERVICES BACKEND \nIn your client application code, initialize an App client to connect your client to your App Services backend. This lets your client use App Services features like authentication, and enables opening a synced realm.  2 \nAUTHENTICATE A USER \nYour client application user must be authenticated with the App Services backend in order to write synchronized data. Add logic to your client app to register and log in users.  3 \nOPEN A SYNCED REALM \nOnce you have an authenticated user, you can open a synced instance of Realm Database to use for that user. Because Asymmetric Sync is write-only, you cannot define a Flexible Sync query to read data on the device. This differs from bidirectional Flexible Sync, where you would create a query subscription to determine what data to sync to the device.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nSYNC ERRORS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Sync Protocol Errors\n * Partition-Based Sync Errors\n * Flexible Sync Errors\n * MongoDB Translator Errors\n * MongoDB Connection Errors\n * Sync Client Errors\n * Handle Sync Errors\n * Set the Client Log Level \nOVERVIEW \nWhile you develop applications using Atlas Device Sync, you may run into errors. This section lists common errors and describes how to and handle them. \nNOTE If you encounter an error not listed on this page, you can file a support ticket. \nSYNC PROTOCOL ERRORS \nThe following table describes Device Sync protocol errors and how to handle them. Atlas App Services reports errors in your Device Sync logs. Error Name\nDescription\nErrorBadClientFileIdent This error occurs when the client is using a realm file that the server cannot access after terminating and re-enabling Device Sync. This error triggers a client reset. To recover from this error, perform a client reset. ErrorClientFileUserMismatch This error indicates that the client attempted to synchronize a realm file associated with an identity other than the specified user. This may occur if Device Sync is terminated and reenabled while the user is offline, which invalidates their previous identity. To recover from this error, delete the local realm file and then re-open the realm. ErrorDivergingHistories This error indicates that the client attempted to synchronize a realm file that has a different sync history than the server realm. This may occur if Device Sync is terminated and reenabled while the user is offline, which invalidates their previous sync history. This error triggers a client reset. To recover from this error, perform a client reset. ErrorPermissionDenied This error occurs when a user's data access permissions are not sufficient for a given request. This can occur if a user attempts to open a realm without read permission or modify data without write permission. To troubleshoot this error, review your rules to make sure that users have proper data access permissions. ErrorOtherError\nThis error indicates an internal failure that is not covered by a more specific error. For example, this might occur when you hit the storage limit of a free tier Atlas cluster. \nPARTITION-BASED SYNC ERRORS \nThe following errors may occur when your App uses Partition-Based Sync. Error Name\nDescription\nErrorIllegalRealmPath This error indicates that the client attempted to open a realm with a partition value of the wrong type. For example, you might see the error message \"attempted to bind on illegal realm partition: expected partition to have type objectId but found string\". To recover from this error, ensure that the type of the partition value used to open the realm matches the partition key type in your Device Sync configuration. \nFLEXIBLE SYNC ERRORS \nThe following errors may occur when your App uses Flexible Sync. Error Name\nDescription\nErrorBadQuery This error indicates the client query is invalid or malformed. This error includes a message that provides details about why the query is invalid. To recover from this error, you may need to verify the query syntax is correct, and that you are using query operators that are supported on the server. Additionally, confirm you are querying a queryable field in your Flexible Sync configuration. ErrorServerPermissionsChanged This error indicates that server permissions for the file ident have changed since the last time it was used. This error triggers a client reset. To recover from this error, perform a client reset. ErrorInitialSyncNotCompleted This error indicates that the client tried to open a session before the initial sync was complete. This may occur when the app has just enabled Sync, and is still in the process of building the Sync history. The client attempts to reconnect until this process is complete. Then, this error resolves and Sync begins working normally. ErrorCompensatingWrite This non-fatal error occurs when a client attempts an \"illegal\" write. The following are considered illegal writes:      * Creating an object before opening a subscription  * Creating an object that would be outside of the client's query view. \"Query view\" includes both the client's subscriptions and the client's read permissions.  * Modifying an object that is outside of the client's query view  * Creating, deleting, or modifying an object or field that the

Any local writes to a given object between an illegal write to that object and the corresponding compensating write will be lost. \nEXAMPLE Consider the following pseudo-code example: obj1.fieldA = 10 // illegal due to field-level permissionsobj1.fieldB = 5 // legalDELETE obj1 // legalDELETE obj2 // legal  Here, the user does not have permission to write to fieldA but attempts to write to it anyway -- an illegal write. The user then performs two legal writes to the same object and another legal write to a different object. Upon receiving the compensating write for the illegal write to obj1.fieldA, the subsequent two legal writes to that object are lost. The end result is that obj1 still exists and its two field values are whatever they were before the attempted modifications. Meanwhile, the deletion of obj2 is unrelated to the illegal write that caused the compensating write, so it stands and obj2 stays deleted. The illegal write appears in the applog as a non-fatal error. Illegal writes might indicate that your application code is doing something you didn't intend. In the following cases, you'll see ErrorWriteNotAllowed instead of ErrorCompensatingWrite after an \"illegal\" write:  * When using older SDK versions that are linked to a realm-core version before realm-core 12.1.0. In this case, the server will not undo the illegal write, and you will need to perform a manual client reset.  * When modifying an object in a collection with asymmetric sync enabled. In this case, the error is non-fatal and does not trigger a client reset. The server skips over the illegal change and does not apply it to the synced MongoDB cluster. \nMONGODB TRANSLATOR ERRORS \nThe following errors may occur in the translation process between Device Sync and MongoDB Atlas. Error Name\nDescription\nMongoEncodingError This error occurs when a MongoDB Atlas write (i.e. not a Sync client) modifies a document such that it no longer conforms to the app's schema. Documents that do not match the schema cannot be synced and any local updates to the object represented by such a document will not propagate. For more information, see Unsynced Documents. TranslatorCorrectiveErasure\nThis error occurs when a synced MongoDB cluster rejects the write operation for a propagated Device Sync change. This is usually caused by a duplicate key exception, which means that two objects use the same primary key. To avoid this error, use an ObjectId or UUID as the primary key value. Alternatively, ensure that every synced object has a unique primary key, even across partitions.\nTranslatorFatalError - ChangeStreamHistoryLost This error occurs when old entries in the oplog have expired before the server-side \"translator\" process could read them. Without these entries, the translator cannot bring the MongoDB cluster and the Realm object server to an equivalent state. This can happen when:  * Sync is paused for so long that entries fall off the oplog.  * You drop a collection that the translator was using.  * The MongoDB cluster is unreachable for too long. Because the free tier has a shared oplog, it is more vulnerable to this error. To resolve this error, terminate and re-enable Sync. \nMONGODB CONNECTION ERRORS \nIf you enable Device Sync on a newly-created cluster, the operation may fail to parse the cluster URI. This happens because an SRV record for the cluster hasn't propagated yet. There are two possible workarounds, either:  * Wait five minutes, then enable Atlas Device Sync.  * Unlink and re-link the cluster. \nSYNC CLIENT ERRORS \nThe sync protocol returns an ERROR message when an error appears to have been caused by a connected client. Each message contains a code number and a description of the error. To see the full list of sync errors, refer to the error code list in the Realm Database Core GitHub repository. \nHANDLE SYNC ERRORS \nEvery application that uses Sync needs a sync error handler. To learn more about sync error handling, see your preferred SDK:   SET THE CLIENT LOG LEVEL \nYou can specify the client log level. Setting the log level to trace or debug can help diagnose issues while your application is is in development. You can log general information or details about all sync events, or log only warnings or errors. \nIMPORTANT Verbose logging negatively impacts performance. For production deployment, reduce the log level.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nSYNC DATA IN ATLAS WITH A CLIENT APPLICATION \nOn this page    \n * Set up Atlas Access\n   \n * Create an Atlas App Services App\n * Configure Device Sync\n * Enable an Authentication Provider\n * Generate Client Object Models\n * Add Sync to the Client Application\n * Connect the client to an App Services backend\n * Authenticate a User\n * Open a Synced Realm\n * Use the Synced Realm If your organization already has data in MongoDB Atlas, you can sync that data to client devices using Device Sync and Realm Database. Follow these high-level steps to get started: \nSET UP ATLAS ACCESS \n1 \nCREATE AN ATLAS APP SERVICES APP \nThe App Services application is the gateway that enables your client device to connect to MongoDB Atlas. When you create an App, you name it, link it to an Atlas cluster, and specify the deployment model and deployment region that work best for your application. To learn how to create an App Services App, see Create an App. 2 \nCONFIGURE DEVICE SYNC \nDevice Sync is the service that manages synchronizing your Atlas data with your client devices. Device Sync, together with the Realm SDKs, automatically manages network connectivity, conflict resolution, user authentication, and user permissions and data access. When you configure Device Sync, you specify the data source that the client devices can access, as well as the permissions that determine what data a user can read and write. You can configure Device Sync via the Atlas UI, the Atlas App Services Command Line Interface, or the App Services Admin API. The first time you configure Device Sync, you may find it helpful to use the Atlas UI as it provides links and information about various settings and options. 3 \nENABLE AN AUTHENTICATION PROVIDER \nYour client users must authenticate in order to access synced data. App Services provides several authentication providers to enable your users to authenticate. Configure one or more of these authentication providers to enable authentication in your client application. You can configure authentication providers within the App Services App UI by selecting Authentication in the left navigation menu, and then click a provider to configure it. You can also configure authentication providers by editing the App Services configuration with the Atlas App Services Command Line Interface, or the App Services Admin API. 4 \nGENERATE CLIENT OBJECT MODELS \nWhen you already have data in Atlas, you can generate object models that match that data to use in your client application. To generate an object model, you must have an App Services schema. Once you have a schema, you can generate object models that match that schema. You can select a programming language to use to generate the schema, which you can then view and copy to use in your client application code. You can generate a schema from existing Atlas data using the App Services UI. For more information on how to do this, refer to: Create a Realm Object Schema from an App Services Schema. Once you have a schema, you can generate a Realm object model using the App Services UI or the Atlas App Services Command Line Interface. \nADD SYNC TO THE CLIENT APPLICATION \nAfter this, you've got everything set up that you need on the Atlas side, and you can prepare your client application to sync data. Device Sync synchronizes data with Atlas using a Realm Database SDK. You can use the Realm SDK in your client application code to connect to Atlas and sync data with a Realm Database on the device. 1 \nCONNECT THE CLIENT TO AN APP SERVICES BACKEND \nIn your client application code, initialize an App client to connect your client to your App Services backend. This lets your client use App Services features like authentication, and enables opening a synced realm.  2 \nAUTHENTICATE A USER \nYour client application user must be authenticated with the App Services backend in order to access synchronized data. Add logic to your client app to register and log in users.  3 \nOPEN A SYNCED REALM \nOnce you have an authenticated user, you can open a synchronized instance of Realm Database to use for that user. You define a Flexible Sync query subscription in your client code to determine what data to sync to the client application. Device Sync looks for Atlas documents that match the query, which the user has permission to read and possibly write, and synchronizes those documents to the client device as Realm objects.

Events\n * Write Events\n * Custom Events \nOVERVIEW \nThe Event Library enables developers to track what data the user sees and edits while using a Device Sync-enabled mobile application. The Event Library can record three types of events:      * Read events  * Write events  * Custom events Developers can specify the read and write transactions to record. Additionally, you can configure custom events to record things like button presses, or what the user is seeing in the frontend application. This level of detail enables auditors or other interested parties to assess exactly what happened, and when. \nUSE CASE \nThe Event Library provides the ability to perform audits to meet compliance requirements in heavily-regulated industries, such as healthcare or financial services. \nEXAMPLE A nurse in a healthcare facility uses an app with the Event Library enabled. The app presents the nurse with real-time vital signs, information streamed in from the medical equipment, and the patient's historical treatment information. The app inherently enforces compliance, because its code blocks actions that the nurse should not take based on the data being viewed. The Event Library captures all the information that the nurse sees within the app interface, as well as the actions that the nurse takes after viewing that information. At some point, this nurse provides treatment to a patient that later exposes the facility to a malpractice lawsuit. The legal department must review the information that was available to the nurse during the treatment. The Event Library captures the digital data that the nurse viewed during treatment, as well as the actions he undertook. By reviewing this data, the legal team can assess whether the treatment was reasonable. Without this information, the legal department can't know and prove whether the nurse's actions were reasonable. \nHOW IT WORKS \nThe Event Library opens a separate \"event\" realm on the user's device. This realm has access to any user realm that the developer chooses to monitor with the Event Library. When developers implement the Event Library, they designate the types of events they want to record, as well as any custom metadata they want to append to the event recordings. When the client application runs, it records the designated user interactions to the \"event\" realm as read events, write events, or custom events. While the client device has a network connection, Atlas Device Sync synchronizes this event realm data to an AuditEvent collection in the linked Atlas data source. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: For information on how to implement the Event Library in a client application, see: Event Library - Swift SDK. \nACCESS EVENT LIBRARY DATA \nThe Event Library records event data in a collection called AuditEvent in your linked Atlas database. When you configure the Event Library, use Development Mode to automatically create this collection and derive a schema from synced events. Remember to turn Development Mode off before taking your application to production. \nEVENT LIBRARY SCHEMA \nYour AuditEvent collection must have a schema containing the following fields: Field name\nType\nRequired\n_id\nObjectId\nRequired\nactivity\nString\nRequired\n_partition\nString\nRequired\ntimestamp\nDate\nRequired\nevent\nString\nOptional\ndata\nString\nOptional Additionally, the schema must contain an optional string field for each metadata key you use. For example: {  \"<Metadata Key>\": {    \"bsonType\": \"string\"  }}  \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: For information on how to add a schema to your collection, see: Enforce a Schema. \nEXAMPLE If you're not using any custom metadata, your schema might look like this: AuditEvent Collection Schema {  \"title\": \"AuditEvent\",  \"bsonType\": \"object\",  \"required\": [    \"_id\",    \"_partition\",    \"timestamp\",    \"activity\"  ],  \"properties\": {    \"_id\": {      \"bsonType\": \"objectId\"    },    \"_partition\": {      \"bsonType\": \"string\"    },    \"timestamp\": {

\nThe Event Library records three types of events:  * Read events  * Write events  * Custom events \nREAD EVENTS \nThe Event Library records data returned as the result of a query as read events. Read events also record any time a Realm object is instantiated, such as when following a link or looking an object up by primary key. The Event Library records read events as a JSON object with two fields:  * type: stores the class name  * value: stores an array of serialized objects Read events store values as follows:  * Single-object read events: the value is an array that has a single element  * Objects matching a query: the value is an array of all objects matching a query, even if the objects are never used  * Reads that occur during a write transaction: the value is the data that the object has before the write transaction began; it does not reflect any changes that occur during the write event.  * Objects that do not exist when a write transaction begins: objects that are created in a write transaction do not produce a read event at all. \nIMPORTANT The Event Library cannot tell if only a subset of the query displays in the client application. For example, say the client application has a list view. The Event Library's read event doesn't record scrolling information; it records the read event as the full query result. Developers must use custom events to record when a client application displays only a subset of a query result. READ EVENT COMBINING \nA stream of every read event could produce a lot of \"duplicate\" events on the same objects that don't add information. To reduce these \"duplicate\" events, the Event Library discards and merges some events. The Event Library discards:  * Queries which match no objects  * Queries which match only newly-created objects  * Object reads where the object is matched by a previous query The Event Library merges:  * Multiple queries on the same table into a single merged query. READ EVENT FORMAT \nA read event object has this format: {  \"_id\": \"62b396f4ebe94d2b871889bb\",  \"_partition\":\"events-62b396f4ebe94d2b871889ba\",  \"activity\":\"read object\",  \"data\": \"{      \"type\":\"Person\",      \"value\": [{        \"_id\": \"62b396f4ebe94d2b871889b9\",        \"_partition\":\"\",        \"employeeId\":1,        \"name\":\"Anthony\"      }]  }\",  \"event\":\"read\",  \"timestamp\": 2022-06-23T14:54:37.756+00:00}  EMBEDDED OBJECT READ EVENTS \nThe Event Library represents embedded objects by creating a link in the parent object to the primary key of the embedded object. When the user does not follow the link, the primary key is the only representation of the embedded object. When the user does follow the link, the embedded object resolves within the parent object. This also produces a top-level object read for the embedded object. \nEXAMPLE A Person object has an embedded object Office which contains details about the location where the person works. When we do not follow the link to view any of the office details, the parent Person object shows only the embedded object's object ID. Parent Object's data Payload with an Unfollowed Link for office {  \"type\": \"Person\",  \"value\": [{    \"_id\": \"62b47624265ff7b58e9b204e\",    \"_partition\": \"\",    \"employeeId\": 1,    \"name\": \"Michael Scott\",    \"office\": \"62b47624265ff7b58e9b204f\"  }]}  When we do follow the link to view details of the embedded Office object, this resolves the embedded object within the parent object. It also produces a second top-level read of just the child object - in this case, our Office object.

permissions for the following common use cases:      * Read & Write Own Data  * Write Own Data, Read All Data  * Administrator Privileges  * Restricted News Feed  * Dynamic Collaboration  * Tiered Privileges \nUSING THE TEMPLATE APPS \nYou can get some of these permissions models up and running quickly with our Device Sync Permissions Guide template apps. Each template app comes with a backend and a Node.js demo client. The backend has all functions, permissions, and triggers set up as described here. The demo client connects to the backend and runs through a simple script to demonstrate how the backend works. You need an authenticated Realm CLI to use these templates. Realm CLI is available on npm. To install version 2 of the Realm CLI on your system, ensure that you have Node.js installed and then run the following command in your shell: npm install -g mongodb-realm-cli  See the CLI reference page for login instructions. Once logged in, you can use the apps create command with the --template flag to instantiate a template. realm-cli apps create --template=TEMPLATE_NAME  TEMPLATE_NAME can be one of the following:  * flex-sync-guides.add-collaborators (corresponding to Dynamic Collaboration)  * flex-sync-guides.restricted-feed (corresponding to Restricted News Feed)  * flex-sync-guides.tiered (corresponding to Tiered Privileges) \nDeploy a Template App \nABOUT THESE EXAMPLES \nThe examples here use default roles. This means the same permissions rules apply to all collections in your app. As your app grows in complexity, you might need collection-specific roles that only apply to some collections and not others. In particular, if a rule expression in a default role uses a \"queryable field\" that doesn't exist on objects in a certain collection, you can override the rules for that collection by providing a collection-specific role. See Role-based Permissions for more information. \nREAD & WRITE OWN DATA \nIn this case, users may read or write their own data, but not other users' data. Consider a notes app where the user wants to persist and share notes across their own devices but keep them private to their user account. This strategy permits a user to create and edit a document if and only if that document's owner_id field equals the user's ID. To set up the \"Read & Write Own Data\" strategy, follow the general steps:  1. Log in to the Realm UI, and then click Sync in the left hand panel.  2. Under Sync Type, choose Flexible.  3. Set the toggle to enable Development Mode.  4. Select the cluster you want to sync.  5. Define a Database Name: select +Add a new database and type a name for the database Realm will use to store your synced objects. You can name it anything you want. A common strategy would be to name the database after the app you're making.  6. Select Queryable Fields: type in owner_id. This allows your permissions expressions (which you'll set next) to use the any fields called owner_id.  7. Skip Advanced Configuration, and then click Save Changes to enable Sync. Now you need to configure the permissions. Navigate to the Rules page. Click the Default Roles and Filters button to edit the default roles. Use the template dropdown to select the template called \"Users can only read and write their own data\".

 Note that the document_filters.read and document_filters.write expressions use the owner_id field we marked as \"queryable\" above. It also uses the %%user expansion to read the requesting user's id. App Services replaces (or \"expands\") the expansion at evaluation time with the corresponding value -- in this case, the user object. When evaluating permissions on a given document, App Services checks document_filters.read and document_filters.write before the corresponding top-level read or write expressions. For example, if document_filters.write evaluates to false, write access is denied; no subsequent rules are checked. However, if document_filters.write evaluates to true, App Services checks the top-level write expression. In this case, write is true, so write access is granted on the whole document. For more information, see Device Sync-Compatible Permissions. \nWRITE OWN DATA, READ ALL DATA \nIn this case, users can read all data, but write only their own data. Consider a recipe app where users can read all recipes and add new recipes. The recipes they add can be viewed by everyone using the app. Users may update or delete only the recipes they contributed. To set up the \"Write Own Data, Read All Data\" strategy, follow these general steps:  1. Log in to the Realm UI, and then click Sync in the left hand panel.  2. Under Sync Type, choose Flexible.  3. Set the toggle to enable Development Mode.  4. Select the cluster you want to sync.  5. Define a Database Name: select +Add a new database and type a name for the database Realm will use to store your synced objects. You can name it anything you want. A common strategy would be to name the database after the app you're making.  6. Select Queryable Fields: type in owner_id. This allows your permissions expressions (which you'll set next) to use the any fields called owner_id.  7. Skip Advanced Configuration, and then click Save Changes to enable Sync. Now you need to configure the permissions. Navigate to the Rules page. Click the Default Roles and Filters button to edit the default roles. Use the template dropdown to select the template called \"Users can read all data but only write their own data\". This populates the rule expression box with the following: {  \"name\": \"owner-write\",  \"apply_when\": {},  \"document_filters\": {    \"read\": true,    \"write\": { \"owner_id\": \"%%user.id\" }  },  \"read\": true,  \"write\": true}  Note that the document_filters.read expression is set to true, indicating that no matter which user is authenticated, they can read all of the data. The document_filters.write expression uses the owner_id field we marked as \"queryable\" above and uses the %%user expansion to match against the requesting user's id. App Services replaces (\"expands\") the expansion at evaluation time with the corresponding value -- in this case, the user object. If and only if document_filters.write evaluates to true will App Services check the top-level write expression. When document_filters.write evaluates to false, write access is denied regardless of what the top-level write expression says. For more information, see Device Sync-Compatible Permissions. \nADMINISTRATOR PRIVILEGES \nIn this permission strategy, users with a specific \"administrator\" role can read and write any document. Users who do not have the specified role can only read and write their own data. To make this strategy work, you first need to define which users have administrator permissions. Atlas Apps allow you to associate custom user data in your cluster with application users. Using this feature, you can create a document with a field that indicates whether the user has administrative privileges. While there are many ways to set this up, one approach is to add a boolean property called isGlobalAdmin, which is set to true for those users with the elevated permissions. Another is to create a string field called role, in which one of the expected values might be \"admin\". In the following example, the custom user object we'll create has an _id field, which corresponds to the user's ID, and 3 additional fields: firstName, lastName, and isGlobalAdmin: {   \"_id\" :

\nENABLE & CONFIGURE CUSTOM USER DATA \nAtlas App Services stores MongoDB documents that correspond to custom user data in a linked MongoDB Atlas cluster. When you configure custom user data for your application, you specify the cluster, database, collection, and finally a User ID field, which maps a custom user data document to an authenticated user's ID. To enable Custom User Data in the App Services UI, follow these steps:  1. Click App Users in the left hand panel.  2. Select the Custom User Data tab.  3. Set the Enable Custom User Data toggle to On.  4. Specify the following values:\n    \n    * Cluster Name: The name of a linked MongoDB cluster that will contain the custom user data database.\n    \n    * Database Name: The name of the MongoDB database that will contain the custom user data collection.\n    \n    * Collection Name: The name of the MongoDB collection that will contain custom user data.  5. Specify the User ID field. Every document in the custom user data collection must have a field that maps to a specific user. The field must be present in every document that maps to a user, and must contain the user's ID as a string. We recommend that you use the standard _id field to store the user ID. MongoDB automatically places a constraint on the _id field, ensuring uniqueness.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    If two documents in this collection contain the same user ID value, App Services uses the first document that matches, which leads to unexpected results.  6. Save and deploy the changes. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: Custom User Data \nSET UP ADMIN PRIVILEGES \nAfter you have custom user data enabled, you can implement the Admin Privileges strategy. To do so, follow these general steps:  1. Log in to the Realm UI, and then click Sync in the left hand panel.  2. Under Sync Type, choose Flexible.  3. Set the toggle to enable Development Mode.  4. Select the cluster you want to sync.  5. Define a Database Name: select +Add a new database and type a name for the database Realm will use to store your synced objects. You can name it anything you want. A common strategy would be to name the database after the app you're making.  6. Select Queryable Fields: type in owner_id. This allows your permissions expressions (which you'll set next) to use the any fields called owner_id.  7. Skip Advanced Configuration, and then click Save Changes to enable Sync. Now you need to configure the permissions. Navigate to the Rules page. Click the Default Roles and Filters button to edit the default roles. Use the template dropdown to select the template called \"Users can read and write their own data, admins can read and write all data\". This populates the rule expression box with the following: [   {     \"name\": \"admin\",     \"apply_when\": {       \"%%user.custom_data.isGlobalAdmin\": true     },     \"document_filters\": {       \"read\": true,       \"write\": true     },     \"read\": true,     \"write\": true   },   {     \"name\": \"user\",     \"apply_when\": {},     \"document_filters\": {       \"read\": { \"owner_id\": \"%%user.id\" },       \"write\": { \"owner_id\": \"%%user.id\" }     },     \"read\": true,     \"write\": true   }]  \nNOTE \nCHANGE THE DEFAULT SETTINGS This configuration has two default roles. The first defines the permissions for an administrator. Note that the auto-generated expression assumes there is a boolean field in the custom user data document named isGlobalAdmin. Depending on how you defined your custom user data document, you might need to change this. The second default role specifies the rules for all other users. The default is to restrict user access to read and write only their own data. You can change either or both of these fields to true, enabling users to read and/or write all data.

realm-cli apps create --name=restricted-feed --template=flex-sync-guides.restricted-feed  Custom User Data Configuration Bug Workaround: Sometimes, the template generator does not copy the custom user data configuration to the new app correctly. You can fix this as follows: the realm-cli apps create command should have output some JSON about the app you just created. From this JSON, copy the \"url\" value (something like https://realm.mongodb.com/groups/...) and visit that URL in your browser. Log in if prompted. From the app dashboard, in the left-hand panel, click App Users. Click Custom User Data. Ensure Enable Custom User Data is ON. If it was not on, turn it on and enter \"mongodb-atlas\", \"Item\", and \"User\" for Cluster Name, Database Name, and Collection Name, respectively. For User ID Field, enter _id. Hit Save (or Save Draft, then deploy). Next, in your terminal, go into the client directory, install the dependencies, and run the demo: cd restricted-feed/frontend/flex-sync-guides.restricted-feed/npm installnpm run demo  Read the output on your console to see what the demo is doing. In this permission strategy, users can create their own content and subscribe to other creators' content. As with the Admin Privileges scenario, we will make use of a Custom User Data collection to define which authors' content a user is subscribed to read. Flexible Device Sync supports querying arrays, so we will create an array within a user data object. This array contains IDs of the authors that this user is authorized to \"follow\". We then set up a subscription that says, in essence, \"Give me all documents where I am the author, or the author's ID is in the array of authors in my custom user data.\" \nIMPORTANT When a user subscribes or unsubscribes from an author, we update the array in the custom user data, but the changes don't take effect until the current session is closed and a new session is started. \nNOTE \nSIZE LIMITATIONS In this example, we are creating an array in the Custom User Data. The size of this array is not limited by App Services, but because the data is included in each request, we recommend keeping the size under 16KB, which is enough space for 1000 128-bit GUID-style user IDs. \nNOTE When using custom user data for permissions, never allow the client to write the custom user data object. Doing so would allow any user to grant themselves any permission. Instead, use system functions on the server side to update the custom user data object. \nENABLE & CONFIGURE CUSTOM USER DATA \nTo enable Custom User Data in the App Services UI, follow these steps:  1. Click App Users in the left hand panel.  2. Select the Custom User Data tab.  3. Set the Enable Custom User Data toggle to On.  4. Specify the following values:\n    \n    * Cluster Name: The name of a linked MongoDB cluster that will contain the custom user data database.\n    \n    * Database Name: The name of the MongoDB database that will contain the custom user data collection.\n    \n    * Collection Name: The name of the MongoDB collection that will contain custom user data.  5. Specify the User ID field. Every document in the custom user data collection must have a field that maps to a specific user. The field must be present in every document that maps to a user, and must contain the user's ID as a string. We recommend that you use the standard _id field to store the user ID. MongoDB automatically places a constraint on the _id field, ensuring uniqueness.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    If two documents in this collection contain the same user ID value, App Services uses the first document that matches, which leads to unexpected results.  6. Save and deploy the changes. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: Custom User Data \nCREATE AUTHENTICATION TRIGGER FUNCTION \nWe need to create a authentication trigger function that creates a custom user object when a user authenticates for the first time. To do so, follow these steps:  1. Log in to the Realm UI, and then click Triggers in the left hand panel.  2. Click the Add a Trigger button.  3.

\nSET UP RESTRICTED PERMISSIONS \nIn the custom user data object, create an array that holds the _id values of each author the user is following. In this example, we'll call it \"subscriptions\". Our user data object looks like the following, where Lily Realmster (\"_id\": \"1234\") is subscribed to all documents written by users \"456\" and \"789\": {   \"_id\" : \"1234\",   \"firstName\": \"Lily\",   \"lastName\": \"Realmster\",   \"user.custom_data.subscribedTo\": [     \"456\",     \"789\"   ]}  You can now implement the Restricted Privileges strategy. To do so, follow these general steps:  1. Log in to the Realm UI, and then click Sync in the left hand panel.  2. Under Sync Type, choose Flexible.  3. Set the toggle to enable Development Mode.  4. Select the cluster you want to sync.  5. Define a Database Name: select +Add a new database and type a name for the database Realm will use to store your synced objects. You can name it anything you want. A common strategy would be to name the database after the app you're making.  6. Select Queryable Fields: type in owner_id. This allows your permissions expressions (which you'll set next) to use the any fields called owner_id.  7. Skip Advanced Configuration, and then click Save Changes to enable Sync. Now you need to configure the permissions. Navigate to the Rules page. Click the Default Roles and Filters button to edit the default roles. Use the template dropdown to select the template called \"Users can only read and write their own data\". This populates the rule expression box with the following, which is not exactly what we want, but provides most of the logic for us: {  \"name\": \"owner-read-write\",  \"apply_when\": {},  \"document_filters\": {    \"read\": { \"owner_id\": \"%%user.id\" },    \"write\": { \"owner_id\": \"%%user.id\" }  },  \"read\": true,  \"write\": true}  Note that a user can currently read only their own documents (\"read\": {\"owner_id\": \"%%user.id\"}). We can change this to include documents whose authors have IDs in the user's \"subscribedTo\" array. To do so, we use the $in operator. The expression looks like this: {  \"name\": \"owner-read-write\",  \"apply_when\": {},  \"document_filters\": {    \"read\": {      \"owner_id\": {        \"$in\": \"%%user.custom_data.subscribedTo\"      }    },    \"write\": { \"owner_id\": \"%%user.id\" }  },  \"read\": true,  \"write\": true}  Update the rule expression box with this new logic and save the changes. Note: we changed the document_filters.read expression to only mention the authors in the subscribedTo array, but users still have \"read\" access to their own documents because of the document_filters.read expression. Whenever write access is granted, read access is implicitly granted. \nCREATE SUBSCRIBETOUSER FUNCTION \nWe need a function that subscribes one user to another. Our permissions are set up to consider a subscriber \"subscribed\" to an author if the author's user ID is in the subscriber's custom user data \"subscribedTo\" array. The \"subscribeToUser\" function takes a user's email address, finds the corresponding user ID in the custom user data collection, and adds the ID to the requesting user's \"subscribedTo\" array. Note that this function will run under System authentication and writes to the custom user data. When using custom user data for permissions, clients must never be allowed to directly edit custom user data. Otherwise, any user could grant themselves any permissions. Instead, modify user data on the backend with a System function. The function should do whatever checks necessary to ensure the user's request for permissions is valid. To create the function, follow these steps:  1. Log in to the Realm UI, and then click Functions in the left hand panel.  2. Click the Create New Function button.  3.

\nDYNAMIC COLLABORATION  NOTE \nTEMPLATE AVAILABLE! To use the backend template and get the demo client, run the following command: realm-cli apps create --name=add-collaborators --template=flex-sync-guides.add-collaborators  Next, go into the client directory, install the dependencies, and run the demo: cd add-collaborators/frontend/flex-sync-guides.add-collaborators/npm installnpm run demo  Read the output on your console to see what the demo is doing. In the Dynamic Collaboration strategy, users can create documents and add other users as editors of that document. Like the Read & Write Own Data strategy, this strategy permits a user to create and edit a document if that document's owner_id field equals the user's ID. Additionally, a user may edit the document if the document's collaborators array field contains their ID. \nSET UP PERMISSIONS \nTo implement this strategy, follow these general steps:  1. Log in to the Realm UI, and then click Sync in the left hand panel.  2. Under Sync Type, choose Flexible.  3. Set the toggle to enable Development Mode.  4. Select the cluster you want to sync.  5. Define a Database Name: select +Add a new database and type a name for the database Realm will use to store your synced objects. You can name it anything you want. A common strategy would be to name the database after the app you're making.  6. Select Queryable Fields: type in owner_id. This allows your permissions expressions (which you'll set next) to use the any fields called owner_id.  7. Skip Advanced Configuration, and then click Save Changes to enable Sync. In the Select Queryable Fields field, type in collaborators as well. This will be the field that stores the IDs of users who may also read and write the document. Now you need to configure the permissions. Under Define Permissions, use the template dropdown to select the \"Custom (start from scratch)\". Paste the following into the rule expression box: {  \"name\": \"collaborator\",  \"apply_when\": {},  \"document_filters\": {    \"read\": {      \"$or\": [        {          \"owner_id\": \"%%user.id\"        },        {          \"collaborators\": \"%%user.id\"        }      ]    },    \"write\": {      \"$or\": [        {          \"owner_id\": \"%%user.id\"        },        {          \"collaborators\": \"%%user.id\"        }      ]    }  },  \"read\": true,  \"write\": true}  The \"write\" and \"read\" expressions are identical. Take a look at one of them. $or takes an array of options. We have two possible conditions where a user may write the document:  * The owner_id field of the document equals the user's ID  * The collaborators array field of the document contains the user's ID. Generally speaking, when a user is granted write permission, that user automatically gets read permission. However, we can't omit the document_filters.read expression because App Services requires both document_filters.read and document_filters.write to be defined for the role to be Sync compatible. \nADDING A COLLABORATOR \nA user can grant write access on their document to another user by adding that user's ID to the collaborators array field on their document. This can be done on the client side. \nSECURITY \nWe don't recommend using this model for highly sensitive data. This model uses the permissions system to keep documents private between the document creator and the collaborators they add to the document. However, if a user has write access to a document, they may write to any field of the document. Consequently, this strategy allows collaborators to add other collaborators. It would also allow a collaborator to edit the owner_id field.

Realm has no built-in way to search users. Generally, the flow for searching users is as follows:  * Set up an authentication trigger to create a user document when a user registers. The user document contains information you'll use to look up later, such as the user's email address.  * Create a function that queries the user data collection for a user.  * Call the function from the client side when the user wants to find another user. To create an authentication trigger, follow these steps:  1. Log in to the Realm UI, and then click Triggers in the left hand panel.  2. Click the Add a Trigger button.  3. Set the Trigger Type toggle to Authentication.  4. Under Trigger Details, specify the following values:\n    \n    * Name: \"onUserCreated\"\n    \n    * Enbaled: Switch toggle to \"On\"\n    \n    * Action Type: Select \"Create\"\n    \n    * Provider(s): Select \"Email/Password\", or whichever authentication provider(s) you are using\n    \n    * Select an Event Type: Select \"Function\"\n    \n    * Function: Select \"+New Function\", and then:\n      \n      * Function Name: \"onUserCreated\"\n      \n      * Function: Replace the placeholder text with the following function:\n      \n      exports = function(authEvent) {    const user = authEvent.user;    const collection = context.services.get(\"mongodb-atlas\").db(\"Item\").collection(\"User\");    const newDoc = {      _id: user.id,      email: user.data.email, // Useful for looking up user IDs by email later - assuming email/password auth is used      team: \"\", // Used for tiered privileges      isTeamAdmin: false, // Used for tiered privileges      isGlobalAdmin: false, // Used for admin privileges      subscribedTo: [], // Used for restricted feed    };    return collection.insertOne(newDoc);};\n      \n       Next, create a system function called findUser:  * Log in to the Realm UI, go to your Realm app, and then click Functions in the left hand panel.  * Click the Create New Function button.  * Provide a descriptive Name for your function.  * Authentication: Select System. This allows your function to bypass permissions on your collections.  * Log Function Arguments: Leave it off.  * Authorization:\n   \n   * Can Evaluate: Leave it blank.\n   \n   * Private: Leave it off.  * Click Save. This brings you to the Function Editor, where you can now enter some to run. \nWARNING This configuration allows anyone to call this function. As a system function, this function bypasses access rules. Assume any client calling this function has malicious intent. In the Function Editor, paste the following code and save: exports = async function(email) {  const collection = context.services.get(\"mongodb-atlas\")    .db(\"Item\").collection(\"User\");  const filter = {    email,  };  // Search for the user by email  const result = await collection.findOne(filter);  // Return corresponding user id or null  return result != null ? result._id : null;};  From your client, you can now call this function. The function's only argument is an email address string. If the email corresponds to a user, the function returns the user's ID. Otherwise, it returns null. \nTIERED PRIVILEGES  NOTE \nTEMPLATE AVAILABLE!

Next, in your terminal, go into the client directory, install the dependencies, and run the demo: cd tiered/frontend/flex-sync-guides.tiered/npm installnpm run demo  Read the output on your console to see what the demo is doing. In this permission strategy, we'll add special roles as well as rules. There are two roles: a team member and a team administrator. The rules are as follows:  * Each user is a member of a team.  * A user can read and write their own documents.  * All members of the team can read all documents created by team members.  * Each team has a team administrator, who has read & write permissions on every team document. To make this work, we need to do the following:  * Enable custom user data  * Create a trigger function to create a new custom user data object for each new user  * Create a function to add a user to a team  * Define the permissions \nNOTE When using custom user data for permissions, never allow the client to write the custom user data object. Doing so would allow any user to grant themselves any permission. Instead, use system functions on the server side to update the custom user data object. \nENABLE & CONFIGURE CUSTOM USER DATA \nTo enable Custom User Data in the App Services UI, follow these steps:  1. Click App Users in the left hand panel.  2. Select the Custom User Data tab.  3. Set the Enable Custom User Data toggle to On.  4. Specify the following values:\n    \n    * Cluster Name: The name of a linked MongoDB cluster that will contain the custom user data database.\n    \n    * Database Name: The name of the MongoDB database that will contain the custom user data collection.\n    \n    * Collection Name: The name of the MongoDB collection that will contain custom user data.  5. Specify the User ID field. Every document in the custom user data collection must have a field that maps to a specific user. The field must be present in every document that maps to a user, and must contain the user's ID as a string. We recommend that you use the standard _id field to store the user ID. MongoDB automatically places a constraint on the _id field, ensuring uniqueness.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    If two documents in this collection contain the same user ID value, App Services uses the first document that matches, which leads to unexpected results.  6. Save and deploy the changes. \nCREATE AUTHENTICATION TRIGGER FUNCTION \nWe need to create a authentication trigger function that creates a custom user object when a user authenticates for the first time.

Device Sync\n * Enable an Authentication Provider\n * Generate an App Services Schema\n * Add Sync to the Client Application\n * Connect the client to an App Services backend\n * Authenticate a User\n * Open a Synced Realm\n * Copy Existing Data Into a Synced Realm\n * Use the Synced Realm If you have a mobile or client application that uses Realm Database, and you would like to synchronize its data across other devices and back it up to MongoDB Atlas, you can do so using Device Sync. Follow these high-level steps to get started: \nSET UP ATLAS ACCESS \n1 \nCREATE AN ATLAS APP SERVICES APP \nThe App Services application is the gateway that enables your client device to connect to MongoDB Atlas. When you create an App, you name it, link it to an Atlas cluster, and specify the deployment model and deployment region that work best for your application. To learn how to create an App Services App, see Create an App. 2 \nCONFIGURE DEVICE SYNC \nDevice Sync is the service that manages synchronizing data to Atlas and across your client devices. Device Sync, together with the Realm SDKs, automatically manages network connectivity, conflict resolution, user authentication, and user permissions and data access. When you configure Device Sync, you specify the data source that the client devices can access, as well as the permissions that determine what data a user can read and write. You can configure Device Sync via the Atlas UI, the Atlas App Services Command Line Interface, or the App Services Admin API. The first time you configure Device Sync, you may find it helpful to use the Atlas UI as it provides links and information about various settings and options. 3 \nENABLE AN AUTHENTICATION PROVIDER \nYour client users must authenticate in order to access synced data. App Services provides several authentication providers to enable your users to authenticate. Configure one or more of these authentication providers to enable authentication in your client application. You can configure authentication providers within the App Services App UI by selecting Authentication in the left navigation menu, and then click a provider to configure it. You can also configure authentication providers by editing the App Services configuration with the Atlas App Services Command Line Interface, or the App Services Admin API. 4 \nGENERATE AN APP SERVICES SCHEMA \nWhen you already have a client application that uses Realm Database, you can use your Realm Object Model to generate the App Services Schema that maps data between client devices and Atlas. You can do this by enabling Development Mode, a feature that reads your object model data from synced realm data, and generates a schema from that data. For more information on how to generate an App Services schema from your Realm object model, refer to: Create an App Services Schema from a Realm Object Model. \nADD SYNC TO THE CLIENT APPLICATION \nAfter this, you've got everything set up that you need on the Atlas side, and you can prepare your client application to sync data. If you already have a client application that persists data using Realm Database, you only need to add a few elements to synchronize that data across devices and with Atlas. 1 \nCONNECT THE CLIENT TO AN APP SERVICES BACKEND \nIn your client application code, initialize an App client to connect your client to your App Services backend. This lets your client use App Services features like authentication, and enables opening a synced realm.  2 \nAUTHENTICATE A USER \nYour client application user must be authenticated with the App Services backend in order to access synchronized data. Add logic to your client app to register and log in users.  3 \nOPEN A SYNCED REALM \nOnce you have an authenticated user, you can open a synchronized instance of Realm Database to use for that user. You define a Flexible Sync query subscription in your client code to determine what data to sync to the client application. Device Sync looks for Atlas documents that match the query, which the user has permission to read and possibly write, and synchronizes those documents to the client device as Realm objects. You can add, remove, or update Flexible Sync query subscriptions to change the documents that sync to the device.  4 \nCOPY EXISTING DATA INTO A SYNCED REALM \nIf you already have client data, you cannot add Device Sync directly to a non-synced realm. You must copy the data from the non-synced realm into the synced realm.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nCREATE A DATA MODEL \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Create an App Services Schema from a Realm Object Model\n * Create a Realm Object Schema from an App Services Schema\n * Further Reading \nOVERVIEW \nYou can create a schema for your App in one of two ways:      * Create an App Services Schema from a Realm Object Schema: Alternatively, if you are developing mobile-first and do not already have data in your Atlas cluster, you can translate your Realm Object Schema into a schema for use with Atlas. Regardless of the approach that you take, when you configure both your Atlas cluster and Mobile application to use the respective data model, changes to the data model between the server and client are auto-updated.  * Create a Realm Object Schema from an Atlas App Services Schema: If you have data in your MongoDB Atlas cluster already, MongoDB generates a schema by sampling your data. Atlas App Services can then translate that schema into a Realm Object Schema to use in your mobile application with the Realm SDK. \nCREATE AN APP SERVICES SCHEMA FROM A REALM OBJECT MODEL  NOTE \nLINK A MONGODB ATLAS DATA SOURCE Your App must have at least one linked data source in order to create a schema. You cannot use Device Sync with a serverless instance or Federated database instance. 1 \nENABLE DEVELOPMENT MODE SYNC \nFirst, enable Development Mode. You can alter or define a Realm Object Schema through your mobile client SDK. Changes to your Realm Object Schema are only allowed when Development Mode is on in the App Services UI. App Services will reflect these changes to your Realm Object Schema in your App Services Schema used for Atlas. 2 \nEDIT YOUR REALM OBJECT SCHEMA \nAs you continue to develop your application, you will need to modify your data model with it to enforce different data validation rules based on those changes. While Development Mode is on, you can edit your Realm Object Schema in your client code. Data Validation occurs when Development Mode is off, so App Services does not accept changes to your Realm Object Schema while Development Mode is not on. \nIMPORTANT \nPRIMARY KEY _ID REQUIRED To work with Atlas Device Sync, your data model must have a primary key field called _id. _id can be of type string, int, or objectId. \nEXAMPLE A group is developing a social media application. When the group first developed their application, a user's birthday was a required field of the User's data model. However, due to privacy concerns over the amount of user data that is stored, management creates a new requirement to make the user's birthday field an optional field. Application developers turn on Development Mode in the App Services UI and then edit their user model within their client code. const realmObjectModel = {  name: 'User',  properties: {    _id: 'objectId',    _partition: 'string',    name: 'string',    // developers set optional: true to adhere to the new requirement    birthday: {type: 'date', optional: true},  },  primaryKey: '_id'};\nRealm.open({schema: realmObjectModel, sync: {/*...*/}})  .then(realm => {    // ... use the realm instance to read and modify data  })  Refer to the Realm SDK-specific documentation for creating Realm Object Schemas.  * Realm .NET SDK  * Realm C++ SDK  * Realm Flutter SDK  * Realm Java SDK  * Realm Kotlin SDK  * Realm Node.js SDK  * Realm React Native SDK  * Realm Swift SDK 3 \nUPDATE YOUR APP SERVICES SCHEMA WITH THE REALM OBJECT SCHEMA CHANGES \nWhile Development Mode is on, App Services doesn't validate writes against your data model, allowing you to freely update your Realm Object Model. When you turn off Development Mode, MongoDB App Services automatically updates your App Services Schema and starts to enforce data validation for your Atlas cluster based on it. Click the \"Turn Dev Mode Off\" button on the top banner or in the Sync screen to turn off Development Mode. Once you turn off Development Mode, the \"Development Mode is OFF\" modal will appear. The modal indicates that App Services has stopped accepting new data model changes from clients. Click the \"View My Schema\" button on the modal to view your updated App Services Schema. \nNOTE To make future data model updates from your mobile client code, you can follow this procedure again.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nMAKE BREAKING SCHEMA CHANGES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Partner Collections\n * Procedure\n * Initialize Your Partner Collection with an Aggregation Pipeline\n * Set up Database Triggers for Your Partner Collections\n * Add Trigger Functions \nOVERVIEW \nIf you need to make changes to an object schema that is used in Atlas Device Sync, you can make non-breaking without any additional work. Breaking changes, however, require additional steps. A breaking or destructive change includes renaming an existing field or changing a field's data type. For more information, see Update Your Data Model. If you need to make a breaking schema change, you have two choices:      * Terminate sync in the backend and then re-enable it from the start.  * Create a partner collection, copy the old data to this new collection, and set up triggers to ensure data consistency.\n   \n   The remainder of this guide leads you through creating a partner collection. \nWARNING \nRESTORE SYNC AFTER TERMINATING SYNC When you terminate and re-enable Atlas Device Sync, clients can no longer Sync. Your client must implement a client reset handler to restore Sync. This handler can discard or attempt to recover unsynchronized changes.   PARTNER COLLECTIONS \nIn the following procedure, the initial collection uses the JSON Schema below for a Task collection. Note that the schema for the Task contains an _id field of type objectId: Task Schema {    \"title\": \"Task\",    \"bsonType\": \"object\",    \"required\": [        \"_id\",        \"name\"    ],    \"properties\": {        \"_id\": {            \"bsonType\": \"objectId\"        },        \"_partition\": {            \"bsonType\": \"string\"        },        \"name\": {            \"bsonType\": \"string\"        }    }}  The new schema is the same, except we want the _id field to be a string: Task Schema {    \"title\": \"Task\",    \"bsonType\": \"object\",    \"required\": [        \"_id\",        \"name\"    ],    \"properties\": {        \"_id\": {            \"bsonType\": \"string\"        },        \"_partition\": {            \"bsonType\": \"string\"        },        \"name\": {            \"bsonType\": \"string\"        }    }}  \nPROCEDURE \n1 \nINITIALIZE YOUR PARTNER COLLECTION WITH AN AGGREGATION PIPELINE \nSince breaking changes cannot be performed directly on a synced object schema, you must create a partner collection with a schema containing the required changes. You must ensure that the partner collection has the same data as the original collection so that newer clients can synchronize with older clients. The recommended approach to copying the data from your original collection to the new partner collection is to use the Aggregation Framework. You can create and run an aggregation pipeline from the mongo shell, by using the /aggregation-pipeline-builder/, or with the /data-explorer/cloud-agg-pipeline/. The pipeline will have the following stages:  1. Match all the documents in the initial collection by passing an empty filter to the $match operator.  2. Modify the fields of the initial collection by using an aggregation pipeline operator. In the following example, the data is transformed using the $addFields operator. The _id field is transformed to a string type with the $toString operator.  3. Write the transformed data to the partner collection by using the $out operator and specifying the partner collection name.

 The following example shows the complete aggregation pipeline as it would look if you are using the mongo shell to do the conversion: Match All Documents in the Initial Collection and Output Them to the Partner Collection use \"<database-name>\" // switch the current db to the db that the Task collection is stored incollection = db.Task;collection.aggregate([  { $match: {} }, // match all documents in the Task collection  {    $addFields: { // transform the data      _id: { $toString: \"$_id\" }, // change the _id field of the data to a string type    },  },  { $out: \"TaskV2\" }, // output the data to a partner collection, TaskV2]); \n2 \nSET UP DATABASE TRIGGERS FOR YOUR PARTNER COLLECTIONS \nOnce your partner collection is set up, you can use it to read existing data. However, any new writes to the data of either collection will not be in the other collection. This causes the old clients to be out of sync with the new clients. To ensure that data is reflected in both collections, you set up a database trigger on each collection. When data is written to one collection, the trigger's function performs the write to the partner collection. Follow the steps in the database trigger documentation to create a trigger that copies data from the Task collection to the TaskV2 collection for all operation types. Repeat these steps to create a second trigger that copies data from the TaskV2 collection to the Task collection. The following image shows the first trigger being created: click to enlarge\n3 \nADD TRIGGER FUNCTIONS \nTriggers require backing functions that run when the trigger fires. In this case, we need to create two functions: a forward-migration function and a reverse-migration function. The forward migration trigger listens for inserts, updates, and deletes in the Task collection, modifies them to reflect the TaskV2 collection's schema, and then applies them to the TaskV2 collection. To listen for changes to the TaskV2 collection and apply them to the Task collection, write a reverse-migration function for the TaskV2 collection's trigger. The reverse migration follows the same idea as the previous step. In the forward-migration function, we check which operation has triggered the function: if the operation type is Delete (meaning a document has been deleted in the Task collection), the document is also deleted in the TaskV2 collection. If the operation type is a Write (inserted or modified) event, an aggregation pipeline is created. In the pipeline, the inserted or modified document in the Task collection is extracted using the $match operator. The extracted document is then transformed to adhere to the TaskV2 collection's schema.

make changes to your schema at some point, such as when you need to:      * Add a new property to an already-synced object  * Remove a property from an already-synced object  * Change the type stored in a property  * Update an optional property to required To make it easier to understand how schema changes affect your app, we characterize them as \"breaking\" versus \"non-breaking\" changes. Atlas App Services provides for non-breaking schema changes to synced realms, allowing old clients to sync with newer ones. Breaking schema changes, however, take some planning and work, and should be avoided whenever possible. Breaking schema changes are difficult because older clients (those that have not been updated to your new code and schema) still need access to the data via the old schema definition. Clients that are updated need to work with the new schema changes. \nNOTE \nMAKE BREAKING CHANGES VIA THE ATLAS APP SERVICES UI Because breaking or destructive schema changes require special handling, App Services does not support making these changes via Realm CLI or automated deploy with GitHub. Instead, you should make breaking changes in the App Services UI. \nBREAKING VS. NON-BREAKING CHANGE QUICK REFERENCE \nA breaking change is a change that you can make in your server-side schema that requires additional action to handle. Failing to handle these changes properly can result in clients being unable to open a realm, or the appearance of data loss when server-side documents are unable to sync to client-side applications. A non-breaking change is a change that you can make in your server-side schema or your object model without requiring additional handling in your app. App Services refers to these types of non-breaking changes as additive changes. They apply automatically to synced realms; you can make these non-breaking schema changes with no additional client-side configuration changes. \nNOTE \nAPPLYING NON-BREAKING CHANGES TO THE CLIENT MAY REQUIRE MIGRATION When you only make non-breaking changes to the server-side schema, no additional action is required. However, if you then try to apply these changes to your client object model, you may need to perform a migration. If the client device has an existing realm file, you must perform a migration. For details, see the Modify an Object Schema page in your preferred SDK. This table shows whether each type of change is breaking or non-breaking when you make it only in the server-side schema or in the object model. Some changes that are non-breaking on the client-side are breaking on the server-side. Additionally, some changes that are non-breaking on the server-side schema may require additional handling when you apply them to the client-side object model.

\nTIP \nRENAME A PROPERTY While renaming a property is a breaking change, some of the Realm SDKs offer a workaround to remap the property name. See Change a Property Name for more details. \nADD AN OBJECT TYPE \nYou can add an object type to either the server-side schema or the client object model without doing any additional handling. \nHOW TO ADD AN OBJECT TYPE \nIf you want to add an object type to both the server-side schema and the client object model, you can add the object type to the object model, and use Development Mode to let App Services infer the server-side schema updates. Or you can manually add the object type to both the model and the schema. \nHANDLE CLIENT REALM DATABASE FILES \nIf you already have a client-side realm file that contains data, you must increment the client schema version when you open the realm. For more information, see your preferred SDK's migration page. \nNOTE \nTHESE CHANGES MAY TRIGGER A RESYNC When you add a new object type, we retreive the documents for the collection and re-insert them into App Services to get the new values. This is expected behavior, but it does cause a temporary halt to propogating changes while this process is underway. \nADD A REQUIRED PROPERTY \nYou can add a required property to the client object model without doing any additional handling. \nWARNING \nUPDATE EXISTING DOCUMENTS If you add a new required property to the server-side schema, you must update existing documents with that new property or they do not sync to the client. This may give client users the impression that the data has been lost. \nHOW TO ADD A REQUIRED PROPERTY  NOTE \nCONSIDER ADDING AN OPTIONAL PROPERTY Adding a required property to the server-side schema requires additional handling detailed below. If you add the property as optional, you can avoid the need to modify existing Atlas documents. If you want to add a required property to both the server-side schema and the client object model, you can add the required property to the object model, and use Development Mode to let App Services infer the server-side schema updates. Or you can manually add the required property to both the model and the schema. \nIMPORTANT \nEVEN NON-BREAKING CHANGES CAN REQUIRE TERMINATING SYNC When there are more than 100,000 documents in the __realm_sync.unsynced_documents collection, App Services requires that you terminate and re-enable sync. When you add a required property, the re-sync process can push your collection over this limit. In this case, you must terminate and re-enable sync, even though the change you're making is a non-breaking change. \nHANDLE EXISTING ATLAS DOCUMENTS \nIf you add a new required property to the server-side schema, you must update existing documents with that new property or they do not sync to the client. This may give client users the impression that the data has been lost. If an Atlas document does not have the new required property, the entire document no longer syncs to the client application. Resolve this issue by adding a new field to each document that matches the new schema, and populating it with a default value. After you've made these changes, the appropriate documents should once again sync to the client application. \nHANDLE CLIENT REALM DATABASE FILES \nIf you already have a client-side realm file that contains data, you must increment the client schema version when you open the realm. For more information, see your preferred SDK's migration page. \nNOTE \nTHESE CHANGES MAY TRIGGER A RESYNC When you add a new required property, we retreive the documents for the collection that have new values per the updated schema. We iterate through those documents and re-insert them into App Services to get the new values. This is expected behavior, but it does cause a temporary halt to propogating changes while this process is underway. \nADD AN OPTIONAL PROPERTY \nYou can add an optional property to either the server-side schema or the client object model without doing any additional handling. \nHOW TO ADD AN OPTIONAL PROPERTY \nIf you want to add an optional property to both the server-side schema and the client object model, you can add the optional property to the object model, and use Development Mode to let App Services infer the server-side schema updates.

\nNOTE \nTHESE CHANGES MAY TRIGGER A RESYNC When you add a new optional property, we retreive the documents for the collection that have new values per the updated schema. We iterate through those documents and re-insert them into App Services to get the new values. This is expected behavior, but it does cause a temporary halt to propogating changes while this process is underway. \nREMOVE AN OBJECT TYPE \nIf you remove an object type from the server-side schema, this is a breaking or destructive change. However, you can remove an object type from the object model as a non-breaking change. \nHOW TO REMOVE AN OBJECT TYPE \nA breaking server-side schema change requires you to terminate sync in the backend, and then re-enable sync. Breaking schema changes prevent applications from automatically recovering from a client reset. As a result, we do not recommend making breaking server-side schema changes. Instead, you can remove the object type from the client-side object model and leave it in place on the server-side schema. \nHANDLE CLIENT REALM DATABASE FILES \nIf you already have a client-side realm file that contains data, you must increment the client schema version when you open the realm. For more information, see your preferred SDK's migration page. \nREMOVE A REQUIRED PROPERTY \nIf you remove a required property from the server-side schema, this is a breaking or destructive change. However, you can remove a required property from the object model as a non-breaking change. \nHOW TO REMOVE A REQUIRED PROPERTY \nA breaking server-side schema change requires you to terminate sync in the backend, and then re-enable sync. This triggers a client reset, which can result in client-side data loss. As a result, we do not recommend making breaking server-side schema changes. Instead, you can remove the property from the client-side object model and leave it in place on the server-side schema. To maintain backward compatibility, removing a property from a client-side object model does not delete the property from the database. Instead, new objects retain the removed property, but App Services automatically sets the property's value to null. App Services sets properties that are non-nullable to an appropriate empty value, such as a 0 for integer values or an empty string for string values. This is considered a non-breaking or additive change to the object model. \nHANDLE CLIENT REALM DATABASE FILES \nIf you already have a client-side realm file that contains data, you must increment the client schema version when you open the realm. For more information, see your preferred SDK's migration page. \nREMOVE AN OPTIONAL PROPERTY \nIf you remove an optional property from the server-side schema, this is a breaking or destructive change. However, you can remove an optional property from the object model as a non-breaking change. \nHOW TO REMOVE AN OPTIONAL PROPERTY \nA breaking server-side schema change requires you to terminate sync in the backend, and then re-enable sync. This triggers a client reset, which can result in client-side data loss. As a result, we do not recommend making breaking server-side schema changes. Instead, you can remove the property from the client-side object model and leave it in place on the server-side schema. To maintain backward compatibility, removing a property from a client-side object model does not delete the property from the database. Instead, new objects retain the removed property, but App Services automatically sets the property's value to null. App Services sets properties that are non-nullable to an appropriate empty value, such as a 0 for integer values or an empty string for string values. This is considered a non-breaking or additive change to the object model. \nHANDLE CLIENT REALM DATABASE FILES \nIf you already have a client-side realm file that contains data, you must increment the client schema version when you open the realm. For more information, see your preferred SDK's migration page. \nCHANGE AN OBJECT TYPE NAME \nIf you change an object type's name, this is a breaking or destructive change to both the server-side schema and the client-side object model. \nHOW TO CHANGE AN OBJECT TYPE NAME \nA breaking server-side schema change requires you to terminate sync in the backend, and then re-enable sync. Breaking schema changes prevent applications from automatically recovering from a client reset. As a result, we do not recommend making breaking server-side schema changes.

To implement a breaking schema change using the partner collection strategy, see Make Breaking Schema Changes. If you choose to terminate and re-enable sync instead of using the partner collection strategy to resolve this type of breaking change, you must manually update the schema. Development Mode does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes. \nHANDLE CLIENT REALM DATABASE FILES \nIf you already have a client-side realm file that contains data when you implement a schema change using the partner collection strategy, you must perform a migration when you open the realm. For more information, see your preferred SDK's migration page. If you choose to terminate and re-enable sync instead of using the partner collection strategy to resolve this type of breaking change, your client application must perform a manual client reset. You can define an error handler in your client application code to execute some custom logic in this scenario. \nCHANGE A PROPERTY NAME \nIf you change a property's name, this is a breaking or destructive change to both the server-side schema and the client-side object model. \nWARNING \nUPDATE EXISTING DOCUMENTS If you change a property name in the server-side schema, you must update existing documents with that new property name or they do not sync to the client. This may give client users the impression that the data has been lost. \nHOW TO CHANGE A PROPERTY NAME  TIP \nCHANGE A PROPERTY NAME While changing a property name is a breaking change in both the server-side schema and the client-side object model, some SDKs do offer an API to map the name defined in a model class to a different internal name. This allows you to avoid renaming a property and triggering migrations, but instead map the realm property name to something different to match your code. You can use this API in these SDKs:  * Flutter: Remap a Property  * Java: Rename a Field  * .Net: Rename a Property  * Node.js: Remap a Property  * React Native: Remap a Property  * Swift: Remap a Property A breaking server-side schema change requires you to terminate sync in the backend, and then re-enable sync. Breaking schema changes prevent applications from automatically recovering from a client reset. As a result, we do not recommend making breaking server-side schema changes. Instead, you can let the existing collection remain in place with the existing schema, and create a partner collection with the new schema. A partner collection is a collection that contains the same data as the original collection, but has the new schema definition in place. Partner collections use database triggers to ensure that data flows in both directions, meaning that when one collection is written to, the other is also written to (with the data modifications required for the new schema). To implement a breaking schema change using the partner collection strategy, see Make Breaking Schema Changes. If you choose to terminate and re-enable sync instead of using the partner collection strategy to resolve this type of breaking change, you must manually update the schema. Development Mode does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes. \nHANDLE EXISTING ATLAS DOCUMENTS \nIf you choose to terminate and re-enable sync, you must update existing Atlas documents to enable them to Sync with your client applications. Without this additional handling, those documents do not Sync and it may appear in the client that the data has been lost. If an Atlas document maintains the old property name, the entire document no longer syncs to the client application. You could resolve this issue in a few ways:  * Change the old field name on each document to match the new schema  * Add a new field to each document with a name that matches the new schema, and copy the value from the old field into it After you've made these changes, the appropriate documents should once again sync to the client application. \nHANDLE CLIENT REALM DATABASE FILES \nIf you already have a client-side realm file that contains data when you implement a schema change using the partner collection strategy, you must perform a migration when you open the realm. For more information, see your preferred SDK's migration page. If you choose to terminate and re-enable sync instead of using the partner collection strategy to resolve this type of breaking change, your client application must perform a manual client reset. You can define an error handler in your client application code to execute some custom logic in this scenario. \nCHANGE PROPERTY TYPE BUT KEEP THE NAME \nIf you change a property's type while keeping

\nHOW TO CHANGE A PROPERTY TYPE BUT KEEP THE NAME \nA breaking server-side schema change requires you to terminate sync in the backend, and then re-enable sync. Breaking schema changes prevent applications from automatically recovering from a client reset. As a result, we do not recommend making breaking server-side schema changes. Instead, you can let the existing collection remain in place with the existing schema, and create a partner collection with the new schema. A partner collection is a collection that contains the same data as the original collection, but has the new schema definition in place. Partner collections use database triggers to ensure that data flows in both directions, meaning that when one collection is written to, the other is also written to (with the data modifications required for the new schema). To implement a breaking schema change using the partner collection strategy, see Make Breaking Schema Changes. If you choose to terminate and re-enable sync instead of using the partner collection strategy to resolve this type of breaking change, you must manually update the schema. Development Mode does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes. \nHANDLE EXISTING ATLAS DOCUMENTS \nIf you choose to terminate and re-enable sync, you must update existing Atlas documents to enable them to Sync with your client applications. Without this additional handling, those documents do not Sync and it may appear in the client that the data has been lost. If an Atlas document maintains the old property type, the entire document no longer syncs to the client application. You could resolve this issue in a few ways:  * Change the old field type on each document to match the new schema  * Add a new field to each document with a type that matches the new schema, and copy the value from the old field into it, transforming its type After you've made these changes, the appropriate documents should once again sync to the client application. \nHANDLE CLIENT REALM DATABASE FILES \nIf you already have a client-side realm file that contains data when you implement a schema change using the partner collection strategy, you must perform a migration when you open the realm. For more information, see your preferred SDK's migration page. If you choose to terminate and re-enable sync instead of using the partner collection strategy to resolve this type of breaking change, your client application must perform a manual client reset. You can define an error handler in your client application code to execute some custom logic in this scenario. \nCHANGE PROPERTY FROM OPTIONAL TO REQUIRED \nIf you change a property from optional to required, this is a breaking or destructive change to both the server-side schema and the client-side object model. \nHOW TO CHANGE A PROPERTY FROM OPTIONAL TO REQUIRED \nA breaking server-side schema change requires you to terminate sync in the backend, and then re-enable sync. Breaking schema changes prevent applications from automatically recovering from a client reset. As a result, we do not recommend making breaking server-side schema changes. Instead, you can let the existing collection remain in place with the existing schema, and create a partner collection with the new schema. A partner collection is a collection that contains the same data as the original collection, but has the new schema definition in place. Partner collections use database triggers to ensure that data flows in both directions, meaning that when one collection is written to, the other is also written to (with the data modifications required for the new schema). To implement a breaking schema change using the partner collection strategy, see Make Breaking Schema Changes. If you choose to terminate and re-enable sync instead of using the partner collection strategy to resolve this type of breaking change, you must manually update the schema. Development Mode does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes. \nHANDLE CLIENT REALM DATABASE FILES \nIf you already have a client-side realm file that contains data when you implement a schema change using the partner collection strategy, you must perform a migration when you open the realm. For more information, see your preferred SDK's migration page. If you choose to terminate and re-enable sync instead of using the partner collection strategy to resolve this type of breaking change, your client application must perform a manual client reset. You can define an error handler in your client application code to execute some custom logic in this scenario. \nCHANGE PROPERTY FROM REQUIRED TO OPTIONAL \nIf you change a property from required to

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nQUERY ATLAS FROM CLIENT APPS \nOn this page    \n * When to Use MongoDB Data Access\n   \n * Set Up\n * Create an App Services App\n * Add an Authentication Provider\n * Add Rules to a Collection\n * Add a Schema and Filters to Collection (Optional)\n * Query from Client Apps You can query data in linked MongoDB Atlas clusters from client applications using standard MongoDB query language (MQL) syntax with MongoDB Data Access in the Realm SDKs. MongoDB Data Access secures data by enforcing your App's role-based access permissions, query filters, and document schemas. These features let you construct complex client-side queries with MQL while your data remains secure on the server. \nWHEN TO USE MONGODB DATA ACCESS \nYou might want to use MongoDB Data Access in your application if:      * You want to use an API like the MongoDB drivers  * You want to write database queries in your client code instead of on a server  * You want to construct ad hoc queries from the client device. You might want to use MongoDB Data Access instead of Atlas Device Sync in an application in these scenarios:  * You are querying documents that are not or cannot be modeled in Realm Database.  * You want to access collections that are not synced.  * You do not want to persist data locally.  * You are using the Realm Web SDK, which does not support Realm Database or Device Sync. As an alternative to MongoDB Data Access in client-side scenarios, you can use the following:  * Atlas Data API  * Atlas GraphQL API You can also use these APIs without a Realm SDK for your client app's programming language as long as the language has a HTTPS or GraphQL client. However, these APIs do not feature the same type-safe MQL syntax as the Realm SDKs' MongoDB Data Access. As alternative to MongoDB Data Access in server-side scenarios, you can use the following:  * MongoDB driver. Using a MongoDB driver to connect to Atlas is the generally recommended server-side approach, as the drivers are more performant and flexible than connecting through App Services. If you would like to apply App Services Rules to driver operations, you can use the App Services Wire Protocol.  * Atlas Data API  * Atlas GraphQL API \nSET UP \nTo use MongoDB Data Access from a Realm SDK, you must perform the following set up. 1 \nCREATE AN APP SERVICES APP \nCreate an App Services App with a linked MongoDB data source. To learn more about App creation, refer to Create an App and Link a Data Source. 2 \nADD AN AUTHENTICATION PROVIDER \nAdd at least one authentication provider to the App. All MongoDB Data Access queries run in the context of an authenticated user. To learn more about enabling user authentication, refer to Authentication Providers. 3 \nADD RULES TO A COLLECTION \nTo secure your client-side queries, you must add App Services Rules to any collections that you use with MongoDB Data Access. To learn how to add rules to collections, refer to Define Roles & Permissions. If you do not add rules to a collection, then every request to it from the client will fail. 4 \nADD A SCHEMA AND FILTERS TO COLLECTION (OPTIONAL) \nIn addition to rules, you can also add a schema and filters to collections that you query with MongoDB Data Access. Schemas define your App's data model and validate documents against it. Use filters to ensure that the clients only write data matching the schema to the database. Filters modify MongoDB queries before they are sent to the database so that queries only return a subset of results. For example, you could define a filter that modifies queries so that a user can only access data that they've written. While schemas and filters are not necessary to use MongoDB Data Access, you should add them to most production use cases. 5 \nQUERY FROM CLIENT APPS \nFor documentation on how to query MongoDB from the Realm SDKs, refer to the Realm MongoDB Data Access documentation:  * Query MongoDB - Java SDK  * Query MongoDB - .NET SDK  * Query MongoDB - Node.js SDK  * Query MongoDB - React Native SDK  * Query MongoDB - Swift SDK  * Query MongoDB - Web SDK MongoDB Data Access is not supported in these Realm SDKs:  * C++ SDK  * Flutter SDK  * Kotlin SDK ←  CRUD & Aggregation APIsRead Preference → On

page contains information on how the App Services Schema used by Atlas Device Sync maps to the Realm Object Schema used by the Realm SDKs. To generate Realm SDK Schemas from your App Services Schemas, refer to Generate SDK Object Models. To generate App Services Schemas from Realm SDK client code, refer to Development Mode. To learn more about how Device Sync uses these two schemas, refer to the Sync Data Model Overview. \nDATABASES, COLLECTIONS, AND OBJECTS \nWhen you configure Device Sync, you specify the data source where you want to store data. This data source may contain multiple databases, and each database may contain multiple collections. The App Services schema maps your Realm Database object names to collections in databases in your Device Sync data source. The title field in an App Services schema maps to the object type name in Realm Database. Because the title name determines the mapping between client objects and the appropriate Atlas collection, this name must be unique among all schemas in your synced data source. The title does not need to match the collection name. \nEXAMPLE Consider an app with a database named Pets. It may contain multiple collections, such as Canine and Feline. The App Services schema for the Canine collection might resemble the example below, where the title field of the schema is Dog. That would map a Realm Database object called Dog to the Canine collection in the Pets database. You could not have another schema whose title was Dog in the same cluster. For example, you could not sync an object with a title of Dog to both a Debug and a Test database in the same cluster. If you want to sync the same object to different collections for app development purposes, you must use different data sources - one cluster for development and a different cluster for production. \nMAPPING WITH DEVELOPMENT MODE \nWhen you enable Development Mode in your Device Sync configuration, App Services can automatically create collections and schemas for Realm Database objects that you sync. It creates those collections in the database you specify when you enable Development Mode. With Development Mode enabled, Sync looks for a collection whose App Services schema has a title that matches the name of your Realm Database object type. This collection could be in any database in your linked data source. It doesn't have to be in the database you add when you configure Development Mode. If there is no corresponding title in any App Services schema in your linked data source, App Services creates a new collection for this object type. This collection is created in the database you specify when you enable Development Mode. The collection name matches the object's type, and the corresponding App Services schema has a title field whose value is the name of the object type. This creates the mapping between your Realm Database object and the new collection. \nEXAMPLE Consider an Atlas cluster with a database named Pets. It contains a Feline collection with existing data. In your application code, you define a new Dog object. You enable Development Mode, and specify the Pets database as the database in which to create collections for new object types. When you sync your new Dog object, App Services creates a Dog collection in the Pets database and creates a schema for it. The title of the object in the schema is Dog. If you later add a new Person object to your application code and then sync it, App Services creates a new collection for this Person object in the Pets database. If you wanted to create a collection for the Person object in a different database, you could define a schema for the Person object in a different database. Or you could disable and re-enable Development Mode, and select a different database in which to create new collections. \nMAPPINGS  TYPE NAME \nThe title field contains the name of the object type represented by the schema. This is equivalent to a class or schema name in a Realm SDK. The type name must be unique among all schemas in your synced cluster but is otherwise arbitrary and does not need to match the collection name. A conventional approach is to name each object type with a singular noun, like \"Dog\" or \"Person\". Schemas generated in development mode or by sampling existing documents use this convention. \nNOTE To work with Atlas Device Sync, type names cannot exceed 57 UTF-8 characters. \nPROPERTY TYPES \nYou

Every property in a Realm Object Schema has a strongly defined data type. A property's type can be a primitive data type or an object type defined in the same Realm Object Schema. The type also specifies whether the property contains a single value or a list of values. Realm Database supports the following property types:      * boolean  * integer  * double  * string  * date  * decimal128  * objectId  * uuid  * mixed  * array  * object For more information on supported data types, refer to Schema Types. Optional\nBoolean\nOptional properties may contain a null value or be entirely omitted from an object. By default, all properties are optional unless explicitly marked as required.\nDefault\nBoolean If a client application creates a new object that does not have a value for a defined property, the object uses the default value instead. When you attempt to create an object that is missing a value for a required field, it fails validation and does not persist to the realm. Indexed\nBoolean\nA property index significantly increases the speed of certain read operations at the cost of additional overhead for write operations. Indexes are particularly useful for equality comparison, such as querying for an object based on the value of a property. However, indexes consume additional storage. Realm SDK data type documentation:   ARRAY PROPERTIES \nBoth Realm Object Schemas and App Services Schemas support array properties. You can find information on using array data types in the Realm SDK documentation on defining a Realm Object Schema.  \nFor more information on modeling array properties in an App Services Schema, refer to BSON Types - Array. App Services Schemas support certain constraints that Realm Object Schemas do not, such as specifying the minimum and maximum number of items. \nEMBEDDED OBJECTS \nEmbedded objects are embedded as nested data inside of a parent object. An embedded object inherits the lifecycle of its parent object. It cannot exist as an independent Realm object. Realm SDK embedded object documentation:  \nFor more information on modeling to-one relationships in an App Services Schema, refer to Embedded Object Relationships. \nSETS \nRealm Object Schemas and App Services Schemas both support the Set data type. A set is a collection of unique values. Realm SDK Set documentation:  \nFor more information on modeling sets in an App Services Schema, refer to Set. \nDICTIONARIES \nRealm Object Schemas and App Services Schemas both support the Dictionary data type. A set is a collection of unique values. A dictionary is a collection of dynamic and unique string keys paired with values of a given type. A dictionary is functionally an object or document without pre-defined field names. Realm SDK dictionary documentation:  \nFor more information on modeling dictionaries in an App Services Schema, refer to Dictionary. \nRELATIONSHIPS \nRealm Object Schemas support the following types of relationships:  * To-one relationships: A to-one relationship means that an object is related in a specific way to no more than one other object.  * To-many relationships: A to-many relationship means that an object is related in a specific way to multiple objects.  * Inverse relationships: An inverse relationship links an object back to any other objects that refer to it in a defined to-one or to-many relationship. App Services Schemas support to-one and to-many relationships. App Services Schemas do not support inverse relationships. Realm SDK relationship documentation:  \nFor more information on modeling relationships in an App Services Schema, refer to Relationships. \nEXAMPLE \nThis example shows how to model a Dog with Device Sync. \nAPP SERVICES SCHEMA \nThis App Services Schema creates the Dog data model used by Device Sync. {  \"title\": \"Dog\",  \"bsonType\": \"object\",  \"required\": [    \"_id\",    \"_partition\",    \"name\"  ],  \"properties\": {    \"_id\": {      \"bsonType\": \"objectId\"    },    \"_partition\": {      \"bsonType\": \"string\"    },    \"name\": {      \"bsonType\": \"string\"    },    \"age\": {      \"bsonType\": \"int\"    }    \"breed\": {      \"bsonType\": \"string\"    }  }}  \nREALM OBJECT SCHEMA \nThe following code examples create the Dog Realm Object Schema in each of the Realm SDKs.

\nThis page lists MongoDB data source support for MongoDB commands, operators, options, and aggregation stages. For information on how to read and write data in MongoDB from a function, see Query MongoDB Atlas. For more information on supported features and limitations, see Service Limitations. \nNOTE Support for an operation may depend on whether you're running the operation as an application user or as a system user.      * A user function runs in the context of a specific application user and enforces data access permissions and schema validation, which makes some operations untenable.  * A system function runs as a generic system user and is not subject to rules or schema validation.

Action [DEPRECATED]\n * Get the Logged In User's Data \nOVERVIEW \nAtlas App Services natively implements a subset of the MongoDB wire protocol, which allows you to connect to an App through one of its linked MongoDB Atlas data sources using standard MongoDB drivers and tools. Clients use a specialized App Services connection string to connect and send requests. App Services supports most client features over the wire protocol, including role-based data access rules, functions, and service actions. This is a good choice for languages that do not currently have a Realm SDK. The examples here are for Python, C++11, and the Mongo Shell. Any MongoDB driver that supports the appName connection string parameter can use the wire protocol to connect to App Services. \nNOTE Federated data sources do not support connections via the wire protocol. \nCOMPATIBLE CLIENTS \nYou can use the following tools and drivers to communicate with App Services using a connection string:      * Version 4.0+ of the mongo shell.  * Any MongoDB driver that supports the appName connection string parameter. All official MongoDB drivers support this parameter in their current releases. \nNOTE Connections to App Services over the wire protocol have access to the full functionality of the MongoDB Service. However, App Services does not support all operations and features available in standard tools and clients. For details, see MongoDB Service Limitations. \nCONNECTION STRINGS \nTo connect to App Services over the wire protocol, you must construct a MongoDB connection string that includes credentials for an application user and an application-specific appName query parameter. \nIMPORTANT \nURL ENCODING You must URL encode connection strings before you can use them to connect to App Services. Connection strings in the App Services UI are properly encoded by default. App Services connection strings have the following form: mongodb://<credentials>@<region>.realm.mongodb.com:27020/?<parameters>  \nCREDENTIALS \nAll operations that you issue over the wire protocol run in the context of a specific application user that you specify in the connection string. The user must be registered with one of the following authentication providers:  * Email/Password  * API Key  * Custom JWT The contents of connection string credentials depend on the authentication provider with which the user registered:   REGION \nThe connection string must specify the deployment region and cloud provider in which the App is hosted. Global Apps use the global region: mongodb://<credentials>@global.realm.mongodb.com:27020/?<parameters>  Local Apps specify the cloud provider and region name using <region>.<cloud> format. For example, an app deployed to aws-us-east-1 would use the following connection string: mongodb://<credentials>@us-east-1.aws.realm.mongodb.com:27020/?<parameters>  \nPARAMETERS \nApp Services requires specific connection string options that identify the application you want to connect to and the authentication provider associated with the credentials that you provide. App Services connection strings have the following query parameters: Parameter\nDescription\nauthMechanism\nThis parameter should always be set to PLAIN.\nauthSource\nThis parameter should always be set to $external.\nappName Uniquely identifies the application, MongoDB service, and authentication provider to which you want to connect. The appName parameter has the following form: <app id>:<service>:<provider> \n<app id>\nThe App ID of the App.\n<service>\nThe name of the MongoDB Service that you want to connect to. This value will always be mongodb-atlas.\n<provider> The authentication provider for which you provided credentials. Valid values:  * local-userpass  * api-key  * custom-token \nENABLE WIRE PROTOCOL CONNECTIONS \nYou must enable wire protocol connections for a linked clusters before you can connect to an App Services App with a connection string.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nEXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES \nOn this page    \n * Add an External Package\n   \n * Add Packages by Name and Version\n * Upload a Dependency Directory\n * Import a Package in a Function\n * Import a Full Module\n * Import a Module Subfolder An external dependency is a library that includes code that you can't or don't want to implement yourself. For example, you might use an official library for an external service or a custom implementation of a data structure or algorithm. Atlas App Services automatically transpiles dependencies and also supports most built-in Node.js modules. \nNOTE \nCREATE YOUR OWN MODULES Though most npm modules are written by third parties, you can also create and publish your own npm modules to house logic specific to your application. You can make your modules available to the Node.js community or reserve them for private use. For more information, check out npm's guide on Contributing packages to the registry. \nADD AN EXTERNAL PACKAGE \nTo import and use an external dependency, you first need to add the dependency to your application. You can either add packages by name or upload a directory of dependencies. \nIMPORTANT \nOVERRIDE EXISTING DEPENDENCIES You can only use one method at a time to specify the external packages your app can use. The most recent method that you used to specify dependencies is the source of truth and overrides previous specifications. For example, a package added by name through the UI overrides any copies of the same package that you've added previously, including those in an uploaded dependency directory. \nADD PACKAGES BY NAME AND VERSION \nYou can add packages from the npm registry to your app by name. You can either add a specific version or use the latest version.   UPLOAD A DEPENDENCY DIRECTORY \nYou can upload a zipped node_modules directory of packages to your app. Zipped dependency directories may not exceed 15MB. 1 LOCALLY INSTALL EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES \nTo upload external dependencies, you first need a local node_modules folder containing at least one Node.js package. You can use the following code snippet to install a dependency locally you would like to upload: npm install <package name>  If the node_modules folder does not already exist, this command automatically creates it. \nNOTE \nALTERNATIVE METHODS OF INSTALLATION You can also configure a package.json and run the npm install command to install all packages (and their dependencies) listed in your package.json. To learn more about npm and node_modules, consult the npm documentation. 2 CREATE A DEPENDENCY ARCHIVE \nNow that you've downloaded all of your npm modules, you need to package them up in an archive so you can upload them to App Services. Create an archive containing the node_modules folder: tar -czf node_modules.tar.gz node_modules/  \nNOTE \nSUPPORTED ARCHIVE FORMATS App Services supports .tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, and .zip archive formats. 3 UPLOAD THE DEPENDENCY ARCHIVE \nOnce you've created an archive containing your dependencies, you can upload your dependency archive using the App Services UI or realm-cli:   IMPORT A PACKAGE IN A FUNCTION \nYou can import built-in modules and external packages that you've added to your app and then use them in your functions. To import a package, call require() with the package name from within the function body. \nIMPORTANT \nWHERE DO I IMPORT MODULES? Node.js projects commonly place require() calls in the global scope of each file, but App Services does not support this pattern. You must place App Services require() calls within a function scope. \nIMPORT A FULL MODULE \nexports = () => {   const R = require(\"ramda\");   return R.map(x => x*2, [1,2,3]);}  \nIMPORT A MODULE SUBFOLDER \nexports = function(arg){   const cloneDeep = require(\"lodash/cloneDeep\");\n   var original = { name: \"Deep\" };   var copy = cloneDeep(original);   copy.name = \"John\";\n

In HTTPS endpoint functions, you can access the request body and other request details from the provided request argument. context.request \nAn object that contains information about the HTTP request that caused the function to execute. {   \"remoteIPAddress\": <string>,   \"requestHeaders\": <object>,   \"webhookUrl\": <string>,   \"httpMethod\": <string>,   \"rawQueryString\": <string>,   \"httpReferrer\": <string>,   \"httpUserAgent\": <string>,   \"service\": <string>,   \"action\": <string>} \nField\nType\nDescription\nremoteIPAddress\nstring\nThe IP address of the client that issued the Function request.\nrequestHeaders\nobject An object where each field maps to a type of HTTP Header that was included in the request that caused the function to execute. The value of each field is an array of strings where each string maps to a header of the specified type that was included in the request. \nEXAMPLE {  \"requestHeaders\": {    \"Content-Type\": [\"application/json\"],    \"Cookie\": [      \"someCookie=someValue\",      \"anotherCookie=anotherValue\"    ]  }} \nwebhookUrl\nstring\nOptional. In HTTPS endpoint functions, the route of the endpoint.\nhttpMethod\nstring\nOptional. In HTTPS endpoint functions, the HTTP method of the request that called the endpoint.\nrawQueryString\nstring The query string attached to the incoming HTTP request. All query parameters appear in the same order as they were specified. \nIMPORTANT \nAPP SERVICES REMOVES THE SECRET PARAMETER For security reasons, Atlas App Services automatically removes any query string key/value pair where the key is secret. For example, if an incoming request has the query string ?secret=hello&someParam=42 then the rawQueryString for that request is \"someParam=42\". httpReferrer\nstring Optional.

If you set the name field, App Services populates the username metadata field with the return value of name. App Services automatically fetches a new copy of the data whenever a user refreshes their access token, such as when they log in. The underlying data is a regular MongoDB document, so you can use standard CRUD operations through the MongoDB Atlas service to define and modify the user's custom data. \nNOTE \nAVOID STORING LARGE CUSTOM USER DATA Custom user data is limited to 16MB, the maximum size of a MongoDB document. To avoid hitting this limit, consider storing small and relatively static user data in each custom user data document, such as the user's preferred language or the URL of their avatar image. For data that is large, unbounded, or frequently updated, consider only storing a reference to the data in the custom user document or storing the data with a reference to the user's ID rather than in the custom user document. identities\narray A list of authentication provider identities associated with the user. When a user first logs in with a specific provider, App Services associates the user with an identity object that contains a unique identifier and additional metadata about the user from the provider. For subsequent logins, App Services refreshes the existing identity data but does not create a new identity.

Atlas Functions support most built-ins with either full or partial support. Some built-ins that are not suited for serverless workloads are not supported. \nNOTE The supported modules and partially supported modules are compatible with Node API version 10.18.1.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nTEST ATLAS FUNCTIONS \nOn this page    \n * Before You Begin\n   \n * Unit Tests for Functions\n * Get a local copy of your App Services App\n * Create a new Function\n * Write Function code\n * Export Function for use in unit tests\n * Unit test exported Function code\n * Mock Services\n * Integration Tests for Functions\n * Create a test App\n * Test in live environment This page describes some strategies you can use to test your Atlas Functions. Due to differences between the Functions JavaScript runtime and the standard Node.js runtime, you must take some unique considerations into account when testing Functions. This page covers how to handle the uniqueness of Functions. \nBEFORE YOU BEGIN \n      1. Create an Atlas App Services App  2. Configure the CLI to work with your App or automate deployment with Github \nUNIT TESTS FOR FUNCTIONS \nYou can validate the functionality of your Functions with unit tests. Use any Node.js-compatible testing framework to test Functions. The examples on this page use the Jest testing framework. You must use CommonJS modules to write unit tests for Functions. 1 \nGET A LOCAL COPY OF YOUR APP SERVICES APP  \n2 \nCREATE A NEW FUNCTION \nCreate a new Function. In the App's configuration files, create a new JavaScript file in the functions directory for your function. touch functions/hello.js  You also need to add configuration information for the Function to functions/config.json. {    \"name\": \"hello\",    \"private\": false,    \"run_as_system\": true},  \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: For more information on creating a new Function, refer to Define a Function. 3 \nWRITE FUNCTION CODE \nTo make your Function code easy to test, keep it modular by separating its concerns into distinct components. You must keep all logic for the Function in the file you defined in the previous step. You cannot perform relative imports from other files in your project in a Function file. You can also import dependencies using npm. You must export your function by assigning it to exports. hello.js function greet(word) {  return \"hello \" + word;}\nfunction greetWithPunctuation(word, punctuation) {  return greet(word) + punctuation;}\n// Function exported to App Servicesexports = greetWithPunctuation; \n4 \nEXPORT FUNCTION FOR USE IN UNIT TESTS \nTo use your code to use in separate Node.js unit test files, you must use CommonJS module.exports syntax. This syntax is not compatible with the Functions runtime. The Atlas Functions environment does not provide the Node.js global module. To export modules to your unit tests while keeping the file compatible with Functions, wrap the the module.exports statement with a check to see if the global module object exists. functions/hello.js function greet(word) {  return \"hello \" + word;}\nfunction greetWithPunctuation(word, punctuation) {  return greet(word) + punctuation;}\n// Function exported to App Servicesexports = greetWithPunctuation;\n// export locally for use in unit testif (typeof module !== \"undefined\") {  module.exports = { greet, greetWithPunctuation };} \n5 \nUNIT TEST EXPORTED FUNCTION CODE \nNow you can write unit tests for the modules that you exported from the Function file. Create a test file for the Function file in a separate test directory somewhere in your project. mkdir -p test/unittouch test/unit/hello.test.js  Import the modules you exported in the previous step and add unit tests. test/unit/hello.test.js const { greet, greetWithPunctuation } = require(\"../../functions/hello\");\ntest(\"should greet\", () => {  const helloWorld = greet(\"world\");  expect(helloWorld).toBe(\"hello world\");});\ntest(\"should greet with punctuation\", () => {  const excitedHelloWorld = greetWithPunctuation(\"world\", \"!!!\");  expect(excitedHelloWorld).toBe(\"hello world!!!\");});  \nMOCK SERVICES \nTo write unit tests for Functions that use the global context object or one of the other global modules that Functions expose, you must create mocks of their behavior.

 Attach these mocks to the Node.js global namespace. This lets you call the mocks in your unit tests the same way you do in the Functions runtime. global.context = {  // whichever global context methods you want to mock.  // 'services', 'functions', values, etc.}\n// you can also mock other Functions global modulesglobal.BSON = {  // mock methods}  You may also want to declare and remove these mocks in setup and teardown blocks so that they do not pollute the global namespace.  // adds context mock to global namespace before each test beforeEach(() => {   global.context = {     // your mocking services   }; });\n // removes context from global namespace after each test afterEach(() => {   delete global.context; });\n test(\"should perform operation using App Services globals\", () => {   // test function that uses context });  \nEXAMPLE \nMOCKING A FUNCTION THAT ACCESSES CONTEXT The function in this example accesses an App Services Value and returns it. helloWithValue.js function greet() {  const greeting = context.values.get(\"greeting\"); // the greeting is 'beautiful world'  return \"hello \" + greeting;}\nexports = greet;\nif (typeof module !== \"undefined\") {  module.exports = greet;}  Now create a test file helloWithValue.test.js. The test file contains the following:  * Import the function exported from helloWithValue.js.  * A mock of context.values.get().

This is especially important because the Atlas Function JavaScript runtime differs from the standard Node.js runtime. Unexpected errors can occur if you do not test functions deployed to App Services. There is no single way to write integration tests for Functions. As Functions can be used in a variety of different contexts for different purposes, each use case requires a different integration testing strategy. For example, the way you create an integration test for a Function that you invoke from a Realm client SDK is different from the way you test a GraphQL Custom Resolver Function, which is different from how you would test a Database Trigger Function. However, there are some general steps that you can take to writing integration tests for Functions. On a high level these steps are:  1. Create a testing App with the same configuration as your production App.  2. Write integration tests that interact with your Functions deployed to a live testing environment. The remainder of this section explains how to implement integration tests for your App in more detail. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: For more information on the unique aspects of the Functions JavaScript runtime, refer to:  * Function Constraints  * JavaScript Support For more information on the different use cases for Functions, refer to When to Use Functions. 1 \nCREATE A TEST APP \nCreate an App for testing purposes that has the same configuration as your production App, except using different data sources and backend configuration. For more information on how you can create multiple Apps with the same configuration, see Configure an App Environment. 2 \nTEST IN LIVE ENVIRONMENT \nOnce you have deployed your test App, test its functionality using your preferred testing language and framework. The Realm client SDKs are useful for testing Apps. These SDKs provide first-class access to App Services. In your testing suite, you can connect to your testing App with a Realm SDK.

This example uses the Realm Node.js SDK and the Jest testing framework to test a Database Trigger. The Trigger Function creates a materialized view of total sales for a product whenever a new sale is made. The Trigger fires every time an entry is added to the sales table. It increments the total_sales field on the total_sales_materialized table by one. The Database Trigger has the following configuration: triggers/materializeTotalSales.json {  \"id\": \"62bb0d9f852c6e062432c454\",  \"name\": \"materializeTotalSales\",  \"type\": \"DATABASE\",  \"config\": {    \"operation_types\": [\"INSERT\"],    \"database\": \"store\",    \"collection\": \"sales\",    \"service_name\": \"mongodb-atlas\",    \"match\": {},    \"project\": {},    \"full_document\": true,    \"full_document_before_change\": false,    \"unordered\": false,    \"skip_catchup_events\": false  },  \"disabled\": false,  \"event_processors\": {    \"FUNCTION\": {      \"config\": {        \"function_name\": \"materializeTotalSales\"      }    }  }}  The Trigger invokes the following Function: functions/materializeTotalSales.js exports = function (changeEvent) {  const {    fullDocument: { productId },  } = changeEvent;  const totalSalesMaterialization = context.services    .get(\"mongodb-atlas\")    .db(\"store\")    .collection(\"total_sales_materialized\");  totalSalesMaterialization.updateOne(    { _id: productId },    { $inc: { total_sales: 1 } },    { upsert: true }  );};  This example tests the Trigger using the Node.js Realm SDK to interact with MongoDB Atlas. You can also use any Realm SDK with the MongoDB Query API or one of the MongoDB drivers to query MongoDB Atlas to test a Database Trigger.

demonstrate how to use the MongoDB Query API in a function to insert, update, and delete data in your Atlas cluster. \nNOTE Federated data sources do not support write operations. \nDATA MODEL \nThe examples on this page use a collection named store.items that models various items available for purchase in an online store. Each item has a name, an inventory quantity, and an array of customer reviews. The JSON schema for store.items {  \"title\": \"Item\",  \"required\": [\"_id\", \"name\", \"quantity\", \"reviews\"],  \"properties\": {    \"_id\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" },    \"name\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },    \"quantity\": { \"bsonType\": \"int\" },    \"reviews\": {      \"bsonType\": \"array\",      \"items\": {        \"bsonType\": \"object\",        \"required\": [\"username\", \"comment\"],        \"properties\": {          \"username\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },          \"comment\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" }        }      }    }  }}  \nSNIPPET SETUP \nTo use a code snippet in a function, you must first instantiate a MongoDB collection handle: exports = function() {  const mongodb = context.services.get(\"mongodb-atlas\");  const itemsCollection = mongodb.db(\"store\").collection(\"items\");  const purchasesCollection = mongodb.db(\"store\").collection(\"purchases\");  // ... paste snippet here ...}  \nINSERT \nInsert operations take one or more documents and add them to a MongoDB collection. They return documents that describe the results of the operation. \nINSERT A SINGLE DOCUMENT (INSERTONE()) \nYou can insert a single document using the collection.insertOne() method. The following function snippet inserts a single item document into the items collection: const newItem = {  \"name\": \"Plastic Bricks\",  \"quantity\": 10,  \"category\": \"toys\",  \"reviews\": [{ \"username\": \"legolover\", \"comment\": \"These are awesome!\" }]};\nitemsCollection.insertOne(newItem)  .then(result => console.log(`Successfully inserted item with _id: ${result.insertedId}`))  .catch(err => console.error(`Failed to insert item: ${err}`))  \nINSERT ONE OR MORE DOCUMENTS (INSERTMANY()) \nYou can insert multiple documents at the same time using the collection.insertMany() method. The following function snippet inserts multiple item documents into the items collection: const doc1 = { \"name\": \"basketball\", \"category\": \"sports\", \"quantity\": 20, \"reviews\": [] };const doc2 = { \"name\": \"football\",   \"category\": \"sports\", \"quantity\": 30, \"reviews\": [] };\nreturn itemsCollection.insertMany([doc1, doc2])  .then(result => {    console.log(`Successfully inserted ${result.insertedIds.length} items!`);    return result  })  .catch(err => console.error(`Failed to insert documents: ${err}`))  \nUPDATE \nUpdate operations find existing documents in a MongoDB collection and modify their data.

\nUPDATE A SINGLE DOCUMENT (UPDATEONE()) \nYou can update a single document using the collection.updateOne() method. The following function snippet updates the name of a single document in the items collection from lego to blocks and adds a price of 20.99: const query = { \"name\": \"lego\" };const update = {  \"$set\": {    \"name\": \"blocks\",    \"price\": 20.99,    \"category\": \"toys\"  }};const options = { \"upsert\": false };\nitemsCollection.updateOne(query, update, options)  .then(result => {    const { matchedCount, modifiedCount } = result;    if(matchedCount && modifiedCount) {      console.log(`Successfully updated the item.`)    }  })  .catch(err => console.error(`Failed to update the item: ${err}`))  \nUPDATE ONE OR MORE DOCUMENTS (UPDATEMANY()) \nYou can update multiple documents in a collection using the collection.updateMany() method. The following function snippet updates all documents in the items collection by multiplying their quantity values by 10: const query = {};const update = { \"$mul\": { \"quantity\": 10 } };const options = { \"upsert\": false }\nreturn itemsCollection.updateMany(query, update, options)  .then(result => {    const { matchedCount, modifiedCount } = result;    console.log(`Successfully matched ${matchedCount} and modified ${modifiedCount} items.`)    return result  })  .catch(err => console.error(`Failed to update items: ${err}`))  \nUPSERT DOCUMENTS \nIf an update operation does not match any document in the collection, you can automatically insert a single new document into the collection that matches the update query by setting the upsert option to true. The following function snippet updates a document in the items collection that has a name of board game by incrementing its quantity by 5. The upsert option is enabled, so if no document has a name value of \"board game\" then MongoDB inserts a new document with the name field set to \"board game\" and the quantity value set to 5: const query = { \"name\": \"board games\" };const update = { \"$inc\": { \"quantity\": 5 } };const options = { \"upsert\": true };\nitemsCollection.updateOne(query, update, options)  .then(result => {    const { matchedCount, modifiedCount, upsertedId } = result;    if(upsertedId) {      console.log(`Document not found. Inserted a new document with _id: ${upsertedId}`)    } else {      console.log(`Successfully increased ${query.name} quantity by ${update.$inc.quantity}`)    }  })  .catch(err => console.error(`Failed to upsert document: ${err}`))  \nFIELD UPDATE OPERATORS \nField operators let you modify the fields and values of a document. SET THE VALUE OF A FIELD \nYou can use the $set operator to set the value of a single field without affecting other fields in a document. { \"$set\": { \"<Field Name>\": <Value>, ... } }  RENAME A FIELD \nYou can use the $rename operator to change the name of a single field in a document. { \"$rename\": { \"<Current Field Name>\": <New Field Name>, ... } }  INCREMENT A VALUE \nYou can use the $inc operator to add a specified number to the current value of a field. The number can be positive or negative. { \"$inc\": { \"<Field Name>\": <Increment Number>, ... } }  MULTIPLY A VALUE \nYou can use the $mul operator to multiply a specified number with the current value of a field. The number can be positive or negative. { \"$mul\": { \"<Field Name>\": <Multiple Number>, ... } }  \nARRAY UPDATE OPERATORS \nArray operators let you work with values inside of arrays. PUSH AN ELEMENT INTO AN ARRAY \nYou can use the $push operator to add a value to the end of an array field. { \"$push\": { \"<Array Field Name>\": <New Array Element>, ... } }  POP THE LAST ELEMENT

The documents each include a grades field that contains an array of numbers, some of which are greater than 100: { \"_id\" : 1, \"grades\" : [ 15, 92, 90 ] }{ \"_id\" : 2, \"grades\" : [ 18, 100, 102 ] }{ \"_id\" : 3, \"grades\" : [ 15, 110, 100 ] }  The following update operation sets all grade values greater than 100 to exactly 100: await students.updateMany(   { },   {     $set: {       \"grades.$[grade]\" : 100     }   },   {     arrayFilters: [{ \"grade\": { $gt: 100 } }]   })  After the update, all grade values greater than 100 are set to exactly 100 and all other grades are unaffected: { \"_id\" : 1, \"grades\" : [ 15, 92, 90 ] }{ \"_id\" : 2, \"grades\" : [ 18, 100, 100 ] }{ \"_id\" : 3, \"grades\" : [ 15, 100, 100 ] }  \nDELETE \nDelete operations find existing documents in a MongoDB collection and remove them. You use standard MongoDB query syntax to specify which documents to delete. \nDELETE A SINGLE DOCUMENT (DELETEONE()) \nYou can delete a single document from a collection using the collection.deleteOne() method. The following function snippet deletes one document in the items collection that has a name value of lego: const query = { \"name\": \"lego\" };\nitemsCollection.deleteOne(query)  .then(result => console.log(`Deleted ${result.deletedCount} item.`))  .catch(err => console.error(`Delete failed with error: ${err}`))  \nDELETE ONE OR MORE DOCUMENTS (DELETEMANY()) \nYou can delete multiple items from a collection using the collection.deleteMany() method. The following snippet deletes all documents in the items collection that do not have any reviews: const query = { \"reviews\": { \"$size\": 0 } };\nitemsCollection.deleteMany(query)  .then(result => console.log(`Deleted ${result.deletedCount} item(s).`))  .catch(err => console.error(`Delete failed with error: ${err}`))  \nBULK WRITES \nA bulk write combines multiple write operations into a single operation.

 \nTRANSACTIONS \nMongoDB supports multi-document transactions that let you read and write multiple documents atomically, even across collections. To perform a transaction:       1. Obtain and start a client session with client.startSession().  2. Call session.withTransaction() to define the transaction. The method takes an async callback function and, optionally, a configuration object that defines custom read and write settings for the transaction.\n    \n    session.withTransaction(async () => {   // ... Run MongoDB operations in this callback}, {    readPreference: \"primary\",    readConcern: { level: \"local\" },    writeConcern: { w: \"majority\" },})\n    \n      3. In the transaction callback function, run the MongoDB queries that you would like to include in the transaction. Be sure to pass the session to each query to ensure that it is included in the transaction.\n    \n    await accounts.updateOne(  { name: userSubtractPoints },  { $inc: { browniePoints: -1 * pointVolume } },  { session });\n    \n      4. If the callback encounters an error, call session.abortTransaction() to stop the transaction. An aborted transaction does not modify any data.\n    \n    try {  // ...} catch (err) {  await session.abortTransaction();}\n    \n      5.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nAGGREGATE DATA IN MONGODB ATLAS - FUNCTIONS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Data Model\n * Run an Aggregation Pipeline\n * Find Data with Atlas Search\n * Aggregation Stages\n * Filter Documents\n * Group Documents\n * Project Document Fields\n * Add Fields to Documents\n * Unwind Array Values \nOVERVIEW \nThe examples on this page demonstrate how to use the MongoDB Query API in a function to aggregate documents in your Atlas cluster. MongoDB aggregation pipelines run all documents in a collection through a series of data aggregation stages that allow you to filter and shape documents as well as collect summary data about groups of related documents. \nNOTE \nSUPPORTED AGGREGATION STAGES Atlas App Services supports nearly all MongoDB aggregation pipeline stages and operators, but some stages and operators must be executed within a system function. See Aggregation Framework Limitations for more information. \nDATA MODEL \nThe examples on this page use a collection named store.purchases that contains information about historical item sales in an online store. Each document contains a list of the purchased items, including the item name and the purchased quantity, as well as a unique ID value for the customer that purchased the items. {  \"title\": \"Purchase\",  \"required\": [\"_id\", \"customerId\", \"items\"],  \"properties\": {    \"_id\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" },    \"customerId\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" },    \"items\": {      \"bsonType\": \"array\",      \"items\": {        \"bsonType\": \"object\",        \"required\": [\"name\", \"quantity\"],        \"properties\": {          \"name\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },          \"quantity\": { \"bsonType\": \"int\" }        }      }    }  }}  SNIPPET SETUP \nTo use a code snippet in a function, you must first instantiate a MongoDB collection handle: exports = function() {  const mongodb = context.services.get(\"mongodb-atlas\");  const itemsCollection = mongodb.db(\"store\").collection(\"items\");  const purchasesCollection = mongodb.db(\"store\").collection(\"purchases\");  // ... paste snippet here ...}  \nRUN AN AGGREGATION PIPELINE \nYou can execute an aggregation pipeline using the collection.aggregate() method. The following function snippet groups all documents in the purchases collection by their customerId value and aggregates a count of the number of items each customer purchases as well as the total number of purchases that they made. After grouping the documents the pipeline adds a new field that calculates the average number of items each customer purchases at a time, averageNumItemsPurchased, to each customer's document: const pipeline = [  { \"$group\": {      \"_id\": \"$customerId\",      \"numPurchases\": { \"$sum\": 1 },      \"numItemsPurchased\": { \"$sum\": { \"$size\": \"$items\" } }  } },  { \"$addFields\": {      \"averageNumItemsPurchased\": {        \"$divide\": [\"$numItemsPurchased\", \"$numPurchases\"]      }  } }]\nreturn purchasesCollection.aggregate(pipeline).toArray()  .then(customers => {    console.log(`Successfully grouped purchases for ${customers.length} customers.`)    for(const customer of customers) {      console.log(`customer: ${customer._id}`)      console.log(`num purchases: ${customer.numPurchases}`)      console.log(`total items purchased: ${customer.numItemsPurchased}`)      console.log(`average items per purchase: ${customer.averageNumItemsPurchased}`)    }    return

If neither of these two scenarios apply, $$SEARCH_META is undefined and the aggregation will fail. \nAGGREGATION STAGES  FILTER DOCUMENTS \nYou can use the $match stage to filter incoming documents using standard MongoDB query syntax. {  \"$match\": {    \"<Field Name>\": <Query Expression>,    ...  }}  \nEXAMPLE The following $match stage filters incoming documents to include only those where the graduation_year field has a value between 2019 and 2024, inclusive. {  \"$match\": {    \"graduation_year\": {      \"$gte\": 2019,      \"$lte\": 2024    },  }}  \nGROUP DOCUMENTS \nYou can use the $group stage to aggregate summary data for groups of one or more documents. MongoDB groups documents based on the _id expression. \nNOTE You can reference a specific document field by prefixing the field name with a $. {  \"$group\": {    \"_id\": <Group By Expression>,    \"<Field Name>\": <Aggregation Expression>,    ...  }}  \nEXAMPLE The following $group stage groups documents by the value of their customerId field and calculates the number of purchase documents that each customerId appears in. {  \"$group\": {    \"_id\": \"$customerId\",    \"numPurchases\": { \"$sum\": 1 }  }}  \nPROJECT DOCUMENT FIELDS \nYou can use the $project stage to include or omit specific fields from documents or to calculate new fields using aggregation operators. To include a field, set its value to 1.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nHANDLE ERRORS IN FUNCTIONS \nOn this page    \n * Basic Error Handling\n   \n * View Logs\n * Retry Functions\n * Recursively Call Function in Error Handling Blocks\n * Use Database Triggers to Retry This page explains how to work with errors in Atlas Functions. \nBASIC ERROR HANDLING \nYou can handle Function errors using standard JavaScript error handling techniques like try...catch statements. function willThrowAndHandleError() {  try {    throw new Error(\"This will always happen\");  } catch (err) {    console.error(\"An error occurred. Error message:\" + err.message);  }}\nexports = willThrowAndHandleError;  \nVIEW LOGS \nYou can view records of all Function executions including which an error prevented successful execution in App Service Logs. Depending on how a Function is invoked, it shows up differently in the logs. For example, logs for Functions called by Atlas Triggers show up in the logs as \"Triggers\" while logs for Functions called from a Realm client SDK show up in the logs as \"Functions\". For more information, refer to the Log entry type documentation. \nRETRY FUNCTIONS \nAtlas Functions do not have built-in retry behavior. You can add custom retry behavior. For example, you might want to add retry behavior if the third-party service that your Function calls has intermittent connectivity, and you want the Function to re-execute even if the third-party service is temporarily down. This section describes the following strategies to add retry behavior to your Functions:      * Recursively Call Functions in Error Handling Blocks  * Use Database Triggers to Retry Functions \nRECURSIVELY CALL FUNCTION IN ERROR HANDLING BLOCKS \nYou can handle operations that might fail by calling a Function recursively. On a high-level, this process includes the following components:  * Execute operations that you want to retry in a try statement and have the Function call itself in a catch statement.  * To prevent indefinite execution, set a maximum number of retries. Every time the Function fails and enters the catch statement, increment a count of the current number of retries. Stop the recursive execution when the Function's current number of retries reaches the max number of retries.  * You may also want to throttle retries to reduce the total number of executions in a time frame. The following table describes some advantages and disadvantages of handling Function retries with the recursive call strategy. Advantages\nDisadvantages  * All retry logic occurs within one function.  * Function can return a value after a retry.  * Minimal additional code.  * All retries must occur within a single Function's max execution time. The following code example demonstrates an implementation of retrying a Function by using recursion in error-handling blocks. // Utility function to suspend execution of current processasync function sleep(milliseconds) {  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, milliseconds));}\n// Set variables to be used by all calls to `mightFail`// Tip: You could also store `MAX_RETRIES` and `THROTTLE_TIME_MS`// in App Services Valuesconst MAX_RETRIES = 5;const THROTTLE_TIME_MS = 5000;let currentRetries = 0;let errorMessage = \"\"; async function mightFail(...inputVars) {  if (currentRetries === MAX_RETRIES) {    console.error(      `Reached maximum number of retries (${MAX_RETRIES}) without successful execution.`    );    console.error(\"Error Message:\", errorMessage);    return;  }  let res;  try {    // operation that might fail    res = await callFlakyExternalService(...inputVars);  } catch (err) {    errorMessage = err.message;    // throttle retries    await sleep(THROTTLE_TIME_MS);    currentRetries++;    res = await mightFail(...inputVars);  }  return res;}\nexports = mightFail;  \nUSE DATABASE TRIGGERS TO RETRY \nYou can also retry Functions by using a Database Trigger to execute retries and a MongoDB collection to track previously-failed executions.

 * Handler Function that invokes the main Function and logs when the function fails to the failed execution tracker collection.  * Database Trigger Function that reruns the handler function whenever the handler function adds an error to the failed execution tracker collection. You can support multiple main functions with one set of a handler Function, execution tracker collection, and Database Trigger Function. Advantages\nDisadvantages  * Each retry is its own Function execution, with own max execution time and resources.  * If the Function is retried, it cannot return a value.  * Each Function call requires two Function invocations, one for the Function itself and one for the retry handler.  * More complex logic, which can be more difficult to write, debug, and monitor. 1 CREATE A FUNCTION TO HANDLE EXECUTION RETRY \nFirst, create the handler Function handleRetry that invokes the main Function. handleRetry accepts the following parameters: Parameter\nType\nDescription\nfunctionToRetry\nJavaScript Function\nFunction to retry.\nfunctionName\nString\nName of the function you want to retry.\noperationId\nObjectId\nUnique identifier for the main function's execution, including retries.\npreviousRetries\nNumber\nHow many times the main function has previously been tried.\n...args\nRest parameters\nIndefinite number of arguments passed to the main function. handleRetry performs the following operations:  1. Attempts to execute functionToRetry in a try statement. If the execution is successful, handleRetry returns the value returned by functionToRetry.  2. If the execution of functionToRetry in the previous step throws an error, the catch statement handles the error as follows:\n    \n    a. Checks if the number of previous retries equals the maximum permitted number of retries. If the two numbers are the same, then the function throws an error because the max retries has been reached. The function no longer attempts to retry.\n    \n    b. Build a function execution log entry object to insert into the database.\n    \n    c. Get a reference to the failed execution tracker collection.\n    \n    d. Insert the function log exection log entry into the failed execution tracker collection. This insertion operation causes the Database Trigger Function, which you will make in the next step, to fire. The main function is passed as the argument functionToRetry. handleRetry attempts to execute the main Function. If the execution fails, this function attempts to retry the main function.  2 CREATE RETRY DATABASE TRIGGER   Now add the code for the Function that the Trigger invokes. The function retryOperation takes as a parameter logEntry, the document that the retry handler posted to the failed execution tracker collection. Then, retryOperation uses context.functions.execute() to invoke the main function with information from logEntry.  3 WRITE FUNCTION TO RETRY \nNow that you have the function handler and the retry Database Trigger Function, you can write the main function. In the following example, the Function randomly throws an error when performing addition. The JavaScript functions that execute this logic are the following:  * getRandomOneTwoThree(): Helper function for generating errors for the example.  * additionOrFailure(): Function with the main logic. The invocation of additionOrFailure() wrapped by the retry handler occurs in the exported function additionWithRetryHandler(). All functions that use the retry handler function should resemble this function. You must include the correct parameters to make this function work with the rest of the retry logic. These parameters are: Parameter\nType\nDescription\n...args\nRest parameters\nZero or more parameters to pass to the function with main logic. In the case of this example, the two numbers added in additionOrFailure(), num1 and num2.\noperationId\nBSON.Object.Id\nUnique identifier for the Function call and retries. Set default value to a new BSON.ObjectId().\nretries\nNumber\nSet default value to 0. The body of additionWithRetryHandler is the retry handler handleRetry invoked by context.functions.execute(), which in turn invokes additionOrFailure.

(findOne())\n * Find One or More Documents (find())\n * Count Documents in the Collection (count())\n * Query Patterns\n * Find by Document ID\n * Find by Date\n * Match a Root-Level Field\n * Match Multiple Fields\n * Match an Embedded Document Field\n * Match an Array of Values\n * Match an Array Element\n * Query Operators\n * Compare Values\n * Evaluate a Logical Expression\n * Evaluate a Regular Expression \nOVERVIEW \nThe examples on this page demonstrate how to use the MongoDB Query API in a function to read documents from your Atlas cluster. Learn about the methods that you can call to query data, the operators that let you write expressive match filters, and some patterns for combining them to handle common use cases. \nDATA MODEL \nThe examples on this page use a collection named store.items that models various items available for purchase in an online store. Each item has a name, an inventory quantity, and an array of customer reviews. The JSON schema for store.items {  \"title\": \"Item\",  \"required\": [\"_id\", \"name\", \"quantity\", \"reviews\"],  \"properties\": {    \"_id\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" },    \"name\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },    \"quantity\": { \"bsonType\": \"int\" },    \"reviews\": {      \"bsonType\": \"array\",      \"items\": {        \"bsonType\": \"object\",        \"required\": [\"username\", \"comment\"],        \"properties\": {          \"username\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },          \"comment\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" }        }      }    }  }}  \nSNIPPET SETUP \nTo use a code snippet in a function, you must first instantiate a MongoDB collection handle: exports = function() {  const mongodb = context.services.get(\"mongodb-atlas\");  const itemsCollection = mongodb.db(\"store\").collection(\"items\");  const purchasesCollection = mongodb.db(\"store\").collection(\"purchases\");  // ... paste snippet here ...}  \nQUERY METHODS  FIND A SINGLE DOCUMENT (FINDONE()) \nYou can find a single document using the collection.findOne() method. The following function snippet finds a single document from the items collection that has a quantity greater than or equal to 25: const query = { \"quantity\": { \"$gte\": 25 } };const projection = { \"title\": 1, \"quantity\": 1,}\nreturn itemsCollection.findOne(query, projection)  .then(result => {    if(result) {      console.log(`Successfully found document: ${result}.`);    } else {      console.log(\"No document matches the provided query.\");    }    return result;  })  .catch(err => console.error(`Failed to find document: ${err}`));  \nFIND ONE OR MORE DOCUMENTS (FIND()) \nYou can find multiple documents using the collection.find() method. The following function snippet finds all documents in the items collection that have at least one review and returns them sorted by name with the _id field omitted: const query = { \"reviews.0\": { \"$exists\": true } };const projection = { \"_id\": 0 };\nreturn itemsCollection.find(query, projection)  .sort({ name: 1 })  .toArray()  .then(items => {    console.log(`Successfully found

The following function snippet counts the number of documents in the items collection that have at least one review: return itemsCollection.count({ \"reviews.0\": { \"$exists\": true } })  .then(numDocs => console.log(`${numDocs} items have a review.`))  .catch(err => console.error(\"Failed to count documents: \", err))  \nQUERY PATTERNS  FIND BY DOCUMENT ID \nYou can query a collection to find a document that has a specified ID. MongoDB automatically stores each document's ID as an ObjectId value in the document's _id field. { \"_id\": <ObjectId> }  \nEXAMPLE The following query matches a document in the collection that has an _id value of 5ad84b81b8b998278f773c1b: { \"_id\": BSON.ObjectId(\"5ad84b81b8b998278f773c1b\") }  \nFIND BY DATE \nYou can query a collection to find documents that have a field with a specific date value, or query for a documents within a range of dates. { \"<Date Field Name>\": <Date | Expression> }  \nEXAMPLE The following query matches documents in the collection that have a createdAt date of January 23, 2019: { \"createdAt\": new Date(\"2019-01-23T05:00:00.000Z\") }  \nEXAMPLE The following query matches documents in the collection that have a createdAt date some time in the year 2019: {  \"createdAt\": {    \"$gte\": new Date(\"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"),    \"$lt\": new Date(\"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"),  }}  \nMATCH A ROOT-LEVEL FIELD \nYou can query a collection based on the value of a root-level field in each document. You can specify either a specific value or a nested expression that MongoDB evaluates for each document. For more information, see the Query Documents tutorial in the MongoDB Server Manual. { \"<Field Name>\": <Value | Expression> }  \nEXAMPLE The following query matches documents where the name field has a value of Basketball: { \"name\": \"Basketball\" }  \nMATCH MULTIPLE FIELDS \nYou can specify multiple query conditions in a single query document. Each root-level field of a query document maps to a field in the collection. MongoDB only returns documents that fulfill all query conditions. For more information, see the Query on Embedded/Nested Documents tutorial in the MongoDB Server Manual. {  \"<Field Name 1>\": <Value | Expression>,  \"<Field Name 2>\": <Value | Expression>}  \nEXAMPLE The following query matches documents where the name field has a value of Basketball and the quantity value is greater than zero: {  \"name\": \"Basketball\",  \"quantity\": { \"$gt\": 0 }}  \nMATCH AN EMBEDDED DOCUMENT FIELD \nYou can query a collection based on the value of embedded document fields. To specify an embedded document field, use multiple nested query expressions or standard document dot notation. For more information, see the Query on Embedded/Nested Documents tutorial in the MongoDB Server Manual. Nested Query Expressions { \"<Field Name>\": { \"<Nested Field Name>\": <Value | Expression> } } \nDot Notation { \"<Field Name>.<Nested Field Name>\": <Value | Expression> }  \nEXAMPLE The following query matches documents where the first review in the reviews array was left by someone with the username JoeMango: {  \"reviews.0.username\": \"JoeMango\"}  \nMATCH AN ARRAY OF VALUES \nYou can query a collection based on all the elements contained in an array field. If you query an array field for a specific array of values, MongoDB returns documents where the array field exactly matches the specified array of values. If you want MongoDB to return documents where the array field contains all elements in the specified array of values, use the $all operator. For more information, see the Query an Array tutorial in the MongoDB Server Manual. { \"<Array Field Name>\": [<Value>, ...] }  \nEXAMPLE The following query matches documents where the reviews array contains exactly one element and the element matches the specified document: {  \"reviews\": [{ username: \"JoeMango\", comment: \"This rocks!\" }]}  \nEXAMPLE The following query matches documents

 \nMATCH AN ARRAY ELEMENT \nYou can query a collection based on the value of one or more elements in an array field. If you query an array field with a query expression that has multiple conditions, MongoDB returns documents where any combination of the array's elements satisfy the expression. If you want MongoDB to return documents where a single array element satisfies all of the expression conditions, use the $elemMatch operator. For more information, see the Query an Array tutorial in the MongoDB Server Manual. { \"<Array Field Name>\": <Value | Expression> }  \nEXAMPLE The following query matches documents where both conditions in the embedded expression are met by any combination of elements in the reviews array. The specified username and comment values do not need to be in the same document: {  \"reviews\": {    \"username\": \"JoeMango\",    \"comment\": \"This is a great product!\"  }}  \nEXAMPLE The following query matches documents where both conditions in the embedded expression are met by a single element in the reviews array. The specified username and comment must be in the same document: {  \"reviews\": {    \"$elemMatch\": {      \"username\": \"JoeMango\",      \"comment\": \"This is a great product!\"    }  }}  \nQUERY OPERATORS  COMPARE VALUES \nYou can use a comparison operator to compare the value of a document field to another value. { \"<Field Name>\": { \"<Comparison Operator>\": <Comparison Value> } }  The following comparison operators are available: Comparison Operator\nDescription\n$eq\nMatches documents where the value of a field equals a specified value.\n$ne\nMatches documents where the value of a field does not equal a specified value.\n$gt\nMatches documents where the value of a field is strictly greater than a specified value.\n$gte\nMatches documents where the value of a field is greater than or equal to a specified value.\n$lt\nMatches documents where the value of a field is strictly less than a specified value.\n$lte\nMatches documents where the value of a field is less than or equal to a specified value.\n$in\nMatches documents where the value of a field is included in a specified array of values.\n$nin\nMatches documents where the value of a field is not included in a specified array of values. \nEXAMPLE The following query matches documents where quantity is greater than zero and less than or equal to ten. {  \"quantity\": { \"$gt\": 0, \"$lte\": 10 }}  \nEVALUATE A LOGICAL EXPRESSION \nYou can use a logical operator to evaluate multiple expressions for a single field. {  \"<Field Name>\": {    \"<Logical Operator>\": [<Expression>, ...]  }}  The following logical operators are available: Logical Operator\nDescription\n$and\nMatches documents where the value of a field matches all of the specified expressions.\n$or\nMatches documents where the value of a field matches any of the specified expressions.\n$nor\nMatches documents where the value of a field matches none of the specified expressions.\n$not\nInverts the boolean result of the specified logical expression. \nEXAMPLE The following query matches documents where either quantity is greater than zero or there are no more than five documents in the reviews array. {  \"$or\": [    { \"quantity\": { \"$gt\": 0 } },    { \"reviews\": { \"$size\": { \"$lte\": 5 } } }  ]}  \nEVALUATE A REGULAR EXPRESSION \nYou can use the $regex query operator to return documents with fields that match a regular expression. To avoid ambiguity with the $regex EJSON type, you must use a BSON.BSONRegExp object. {  \"<Field Name>\": {    \"$regex\": BSON.BSONRegExp(<RegEx String>, <RegEx Options>)  }}  \nEXAMPLE The following query matches documents where the name value contains the substring ball (case-insensitive). {  \"name\": { \"$regex\": BSON.BSONRegExp(\".+ball\", \"i\") }} \n←  Query MongoDB AtlasWrite

Recent Logs\n * Tail Logs in Real Time\n * View Error Logs\n * Filter Logs by Type\n * View Logs for a Date Range\n * App Services API\n * Get Recent Logs\n * Get Logs for a Date Range\n * Get Paginated Logs \nAPP SERVICES UI \nYou can view, filter, search, and download an application's logs in the App Services UI. To see your App's logs, click Logs in the left navigation menu.  \nFILTER LOGS \nDrop-down menus enable filtering by predefined types of log entry, the status of entries. You can also specify a date range, filter by user ID, and show only entries associated with a specific request ID. \nLIMIT THE NUMBER OF LOG ENTRIES \nIn the text field with the placeholder text Max # of Logs, enter the maximum number of results you want to display on the page. If there are more records beyond your limit, you will see a Load More button at the bottom of the list of log entries. \nDOWNLOAD LOGS \nClick the download button, to the right of the Apply button, to download the log entries that meet your filter criteria (or all log entries if you haven't specified any filters). When you click this button, a dialog appears confirming the filters that will be applied and prompting you to (optionally) limit the number of results. The resulting collection of log entries is in a .zip file that contains a single JSON file.  \nAPP SERVICES CLI \nYou can access an application's logs in your terminal or a shell script with the App Services CLI. \nVIEW RECENT LOGS \nTo return the 100 most recent log entries for your application, run realm-cli logs list. realm-cli logs list  \nTAIL LOGS IN REAL TIME \nYou can use the --tail flag to open a stream that displays application logs as they come in. realm-cli logs list --tail  \nVIEW ERROR LOGS \nYou can use the --errors flag to view only error logs. If you don't specify the flag, the command returns both error logs and regular logs. realm-cli logs list --errors  \nFILTER LOGS BY TYPE \nYou can use the --type flag to view logs of one or more specific types. If you don't specify a type, the command returns logs of all types. The following types are valid:      * auth  * function  * push  * service  * trigger  * graphql  * sync  * schema realm-cli logs list --type=function --type=trigger  \nVIEW LOGS FOR A DATE RANGE \nYou can use the --start and --end flags to view logs from a range of dates. The flags accept ISODate strings and you can use them separately or together. realm-cli logs list --start=\"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000+0000\" --end=\"2021-02-01T00:00:00.000+0000\"  \nAPP SERVICES API \nYou can access an application's logs over HTTPS by calling the Admin API Logs endpoints. To use the Admin API you'll need your Project ID, App ID, and authentication credentials. To learn how to find these, see Project & Application IDs and Get Authentication Tokens. The examples in this section use the following helper functions in a Function: async function authenticate(publicApiKey, privateApiKey) {  const result = await context.http.post({    url: `${ADMIN_API_BASE_URL}/auth/providers/mongodb-cloud/login`,    headers: {      \"Content-Type\": [\"application/json\"],      \"Accept\": [\"application/json\"],    },    body: {      \"username\": publicApiKey,      \"apiKey\": privateApiKey,    },    encodeBodyAsJSON: true  })  return EJSON.parse(result.body.text());}\nfunction formatQueryString(queryParams) {  const params =

To learn how, see Get Paginated Logs. const ADMIN_API_BASE_URL = \"https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0\";exports = async function() {  // Get values that you need for requests  const projectId = \"<Atlas Project ID>\";  const appId = \"<App ID>\";  const publicApiKey = \"<Atlas Public API Key>\";  const privateApiKey = \"<Atlas Private API Key>\";\n  // Authenticate with the Atlas API Key  const { access_token } = await authenticate(publicApiKey, privateApiKey);\n  // Get logs for your App  const logsEndpoint = `${ADMIN_API_BASE_URL}/groups/${projectId}/apps/${appId}/logs`;  const  request = {    \"url\": logsEndpoint + formatQueryString({      start_date: \"2019-07-01\",      end_date: \"2019-07-31\",    }),    \"headers\": {      \"Authorization\": [`Bearer ${access_token}`]    }  };  const result = await context.http.get(request);  const logs = EJSON.parse(result.body.text());  return logs;}  \nGET PAGINATED LOGS \nApp Services returns a maximum of 100 log entries for each request. If a query matches more than 100 log entries, the API returns the first \"page\" of 100 results and include additional parameters in the response that you can provide to get the next page(s) of up to 100 entries. \nNOTE \nPAGINATED RESPONSES A paginated response resembles the following document, where nextEndDate and nextSkip are optional: {  logs: [<Log Entry>, ...],  nextEndDate: \"<End date of

Forwarder\n * 1. Create a Log Forwarder\n * 2. Choose Which Logs to Forward\n * 3. Configure Log Batching\n * 5. Define an Action\n * 6. Save and Deploy your Changes\n * Restart a Suspended Log Forwarder \nOVERVIEW \nYou can configure a log forwarder to automatically store your application's server-side logs in a MongoDB collection or send them to an external service. Atlas App Services can forward logs individually as they're created or batch logs together to reduce overhead. A log forwarder consists of the following components:      * An action that controls how and where App Services forwards logs.  * A filter that controls which logs App Services forwards.  * A policy that controls whether App Services batches logs or forwards them individually. \nWHY SHOULD I CONFIGURE LOG FORWARDING? \nConsider setting up a log forwarder if you need to do any of the following:  * Store logs for longer than App Services's retention period of 10 days.  * Integrate logs into an external logging service  * Access logs in Atlas Search, Online Archive, and Charts \nHOW IS LOG FORWARDING BILLED? \nEach log forward action invocation (on either an individual log or a batch) is billed as one App Services request. \nSET UP A LOG FORWARDER  1. CREATE A LOG FORWARDER   \n2. CHOOSE WHICH LOGS TO FORWARD \nApp Services can forward all of your app's logs or send only a subset to the target collection or service. You control this subset for each log forwarder by defining filters for the log type (e.g. functions, sync, etc.) and status (i.e. success or error) that invoke the forwarder's action.   IMPORTANT App Services only forwards a given log if both its type and status are specified in the filter. For example, consider a forwarder that filters for sync logs with an error status. The filter would forward the following log: { \"type\": \"sync\", \"status\": \"error\", ... }  The filter would not forward the following logs: { \"type\": \"sync\", \"status\": \"success\", ... }{ \"type\": \"schema\", \"status\": \"error\", ... }  \n3. CONFIGURE LOG BATCHING \nApp Services can combine multiple logs in to a single batched request to reduce overhead. The way that App Services groups logs into batches is controlled by a batching policy. App Services supports the following batching policies:  * No Batching: App Services forwards logs individually as their corresponding requests occur.  * Batching: The forwarder groups documents into a batch as they happen. Each batch may include up to 100 log entries. When a batch is full, App Services forwards the entire batch in a single request. App Services forwards logs at least once a minute regardless of the number of logs in the current batch.   5. DEFINE AN ACTION \nA log forwarder can automatically store logs in a linked MongoDB collection or call a custom function that sends the logs to an external service. STORE LOGS IN A MONGODB COLLECTION   FORWARD LOGS WITH A CUSTOM FUNCTION \nTo forward logs to an external service, write a function that accepts an array of log objects and calls the service through an API, SDK, or library. \nNOTE Depending on your batching policy and log frequency, App Services may call a log forwarding function with an array of up to 100 log objects. The function should have the same signature as the following example: /functions/<function name>.js exports = async function(logs) {  // `logs` is an array of 1-100 log objects  // Use an API or library to send the logs to another service.  await context.http.post({    url: \"https://api.example.com/logs\",    body: logs,    encodeBodyAsJSON: true  });}  Once you've written the log forwarding function, you can assign it to a log forwarder by name.   6. SAVE AND DEPLOY YOUR CHANGES   \nRESTART A SUSPENDED LOG FORWARDER \nA log forwarder may suspend in response to an event that prevents it from continuing, such as a network disruption or a change to the underlying cluster that stores the logs. Once suspended, a forwarder cannot be invoked and does not forward any logs.

If returnHeader is true, returns an object that contains the JOSE header in the header field and the decoded EJSON payload in the payload field. {  \"header\": {    \"<JOSE Header Field>\": <JOSE Header Value>,    ...  },  \"payload\": {    \"<JWT Claim Field>\": <JWT Claim Value>,    ...  }}  \nEXAMPLE Consider the following signed JWT string: \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvZSBTY2htb2UiLCJpYXQiOjE1NjU3MjEyMjMxODd9.-QL15ldu2BYuJokNWT6YRiwZQIiIpvq6Kyv-C6qslNdNiUVxo8zqLJZ1iEkNf2yZKMIrQuMCtIC1tzd2H31AxA\"  The JWT was signed using the HS512 signing method with the secret value \"SuperSecret\". We can decode the JWT's claims object utils.jwt.decode().

If the signature is valid, it guarantees that the signer has access to the corresponding private key and that the message content has not been altered since it was signed. utils.crypto.verify(  encryptionType: string,  message: string,  publicKey: string,  signature: BSON.Binary,  signatureScheme: string): boolean \nParameter\nType\nDescription\nencryptionType\nstring The type of encryption that was used to generate the private/public key pair. The following encryption types are supported:  * RSA Encryption (\"rsa\") message\nstring\nThe text string for which you want to verify the signature. If the signature is valid, this is the exact message that was signed.\npublicKey\nstring The public key for which you want to verify the signature. If the signature is valid, this is the corresponding public key of the private key that was used to sign the message. \nIMPORTANT \nKEY FORMAT Not all RSA keys use the same format. App Services can only verify signatures with RSA keys that conform to the standard PKCS#1 format. Public keys in this format have the header -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----.

Type\nDescription\nBSON.ObjectId\nRepresent an ObjectId value\nBSON.BSONRegExp\nRepresent a regular expression\nBSON.Binary\nRepresent a binary data structure\nBSON.MaxKey\nRepresent a value that compares higher than all other values\nBSON.MinKey\nRepresent a value that compares lower than all other values\nBSON.Int32\nRepresent a 32-bit signed integer\nBSON.Long\nRepresent a 64-bit signed integer\nBSON.Double\nRepresent a 64-bit floating point number\nBSON.Decimal128\nRepresent a 128-bit floating point number \nBSON.OBJECTID \nThe BSON.ObjectId type represents a 12-byte MongoDB ObjectId identifier. BSON.ObjectId() \nConstructs a BSON.ObjectId object that encodes an ObjectId new BSON.ObjectId(id: string) \nParameter\nType\nDescription\nid\nstring\nOptional. A 12-byte string or a string of 24 hex characters. Returns:A BSON.ObjectId object that encodes the specified ObjectId string or a generated ObjectId string if none was specified. \nEXAMPLE const objectId = new BSON.ObjectId(\"5e58667d902d38559c802b13\");const generatedObjectId = new BSON.ObjectId();  \nBSON.BSONREGEXP \nThe BSON.BSONRegExp type represents a regular expression. You can use a BSON.BSONRegExp object with the $regex query operator to perform a regular expression query on a MongoDB collection. BSON.BSONRegExp() \nConstructs a BSON.BSONRegExp object from a regular expression string. You can optionally specify configuration flags. BSON.BSONRegExp(pattern: string, flags: string) \nParameter\nType\nDescription\npattern\nstring\nA regular expression pattern.\nflags\nstring\nOptional. One or more regular expression flags.

Returns:A BSON.Binary object that encodes the provided base64 string. \nEXAMPLE const binary = BSON.Binary.fromBase64(\"VGVzdCBtZXNzYWdlIHBsZWFzZSBpZ25vcmU=\"); \nBSON.Binary.prototype.toBase64() \nConverts a BSON.Binary object into a base64 string. BSON.Binary.prototype.toBase64(): string  Returns:A base64 string representation of the BSON.Binary object. \nEXAMPLE const binary = BSON.Binary.fromBase64(\"VGVzdCBtZXNzYWdlIHBsZWFzZSBpZ25vcmU=\");const base64String = binary.toBase64(); \nBSON.Binary.prototype.text() \nConverts the BSON.Binary object into a UTF-8 string. BSON.Binary.prototype.text(): string  Returns:A UTF-8 string representation of the provided BSON.Binary object. \nEXAMPLE const binary = BSON.Binary.fromBase64(\"VGVzdCBtZXNzYWdlIHBsZWFzZSBpZ25vcmU=\");const decodedString = binary.text();  \nBSON.MAXKEY \nThe BSON.MaxKey type represents a value that compares higher than all other BSON values. \nEXAMPLE await collection.findOne({ date: { $lt: BSON.MaxKey } });  \nBSON.MINKEY \nThe BSON.MinKey type represents a value that compares lower than all other BSON values. \nEXAMPLE await collection.findOne({ date: { $gt: BSON.MinKey } });  \nBSON.INT32 \nThe BSON.Int32 type represents a 32-bit signed integer. BSON.Int32() \nConstructs a BSON.Int32 object from a 32-bit number.

Suspended Trigger\n * Manually Resume a Suspended Trigger\n * Last Cluster Time Processed\n * Example\n * Performance Optimization\n * Disable Event Ordering for Burst Operations\n * Disable Collection-Level Preimages\n * Use Match Expressions to Limit Trigger Invocations\n * Use Project Expressions to Reduce Input Data Size Database Triggers allow you to execute server-side logic whenever a document is added, updated, or removed in a linked MongoDB Atlas cluster. Unlike SQL data triggers, which run on the database server, triggers run on a serverless compute layer that scales independently of the database server. Triggers automatically call Atlas Functions and can forward events to external handlers through AWS EventBridge. Use database triggers to implement event-driven data interactions. For example, you can automatically update information in one document when a related document changes or send a request to an external service whenever a new document is inserted. Database triggers use MongoDB change streams to watch for real-time changes in a collection. A change stream is a series of database events that each describe an operation on a document in the collection. Your app opens a single change stream for each collection with at least one enabled trigger. If multiple triggers are enabled for a collection they all share the same change stream. You control which operations cause a trigger to fire as well as what happens when it does. For example, you can run a function whenever a specific field of a document is updated. The function can access the entire change event, so you always know what changed. You can also pass the change event to AWS EventBridge to handle the event outside of Atlas. Triggers support $match expressions to filter change events and $project expressions to limit the data included in each event. \nIMPORTANT \nCHANGE STREAM LIMITATIONS There are limits on the total number of change streams you can open on a cluster, depending on the cluster's size. Refer to change stream limitations for more information. You cannot define a database trigger on a serverless instance or Federated database instance because they do not support change streams. \nCREATE A DATABASE TRIGGER   \nCONFIGURATION \nDatabase Triggers have the following configuration options: Field\nDescription\nTrigger Type\nRequired. The type of the Trigger. Set this value to DATABASE for database Triggers\nTrigger Name\nRequired. The name of the Trigger.\nLinked Function\nRequired. The name of the Atlas Function that the Trigger executes whenever it fires. The Trigger passes the database event object that caused it to fire as the only argument to this Function.\nCluster\nRequired. The name of the MongoDB Service that the Trigger is associated with.\nDatabase Name\nRequired. The MongoDB database that contains the watched collection.\nCollection Name\nRequired. The name of the collection that the Trigger watches for change events.\nOperation Types Required. A list of one or more database operation types that cause the Trigger to fire. Format each operation type as an uppercase string, e.g., \"INSERT\". \nWARNING Update operations executed from MongoDB Compass or the MongoDB Atlas Data Explorer fully replace the previous document. As a result, update operations from these clients will generate REPLACE change events rather than UPDATE events. Full Document If enabled, UPDATE change events include the latest majority-committed version of the modified document after the change was applied in the fullDocument field. \nNOTE Regardless of this setting:      * INSERT and REPLACE events always include the fullDocument field.  * DELETE events never include the fullDocument field. Document Preimage If enabled, change events include a copy of the modified document from immediately before the change was applied in the fullDocumentBeforeChange field. All change events except for INSERT events include the document preimage. \nTIP \nPERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION Preimages require additional storage overhead that may affect performance. If you're not using preimages on a collection, you should disable preimages. To learn more, see Disable Collection-Level Preimages. Event Ordering If event ordering is enabled, multiple executions of this Trigger will occur sequentially based on the timestamps of the change events. If event ordering is disabled, multiple executions of this Trigger will occur independently. \nTIP \nPERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION Improve performance for Triggers that respond to bulk database operations by disabling event ordering.

\nNOTE \nUSE DOT-NOTATION FOR EMBEDDED FIELDS MongoDB performs a full equality match for embedded documents in a match expression. If you want to match a specific field in an embedded document, refer to the field directly using dot-notation. For more information, see Query on Embedded Documents in the MongoDB server manual. \nTIP \nPERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION Limit the number of fields that the Trigger processes by using a $match expression. Learn more. Project Expression Optional. A $project expression that selects a subset of fields from each event in the change stream. You can use this to optimize the trigger's execution. The expression is an object that maps the name of fields in the change event to either a 0, which excludes the field, or a 1, which includes it. An expression can have values of either 0 or 1 but not both together. This splits projections into two categories, inclusive and exclusive:  * An inclusive project expression specifies fields to include in each change event document. The expression is an object that maps the name of fields to include to a 1. If you don't include a field, it is not included in the projected change event.\n   \n   \n   EXAMPLE\n   \n   The following projection includes only the _id and fullDocument fields:\n   \n   {  _id: 1,  fullDocument: 1}\n   \n     * An exclusive project expression specifies fields to exclude from each change event document. The expression is an object that maps the name of fields to include to a 0. If you don't exclude a field, it is included in the projected change event.\n   \n   \n   EXAMPLE\n   \n   The following projection excludes the _id and fullDocument fields:\n   \n   {  _id: 0,  fullDocument: 0}\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   NOTE\n   \n   You cannot exclude the operation_type field with a projection. This ensures that the trigger can always check if it should run for a given event's operation type. Auto-Resume Triggers Optional. If enabled, when this Trigger's resume token cannot be found in the cluster's oplog, the Trigger automatically resumes processing events at the next relevant change stream event. All change stream events from when the Trigger was suspended until the Trigger resumes execution do not have the Trigger fire for them. \nDATABASE CHANGE EVENTS \nDatabase change events represent individual changes in a specific collection of your linked MongoDB Atlas cluster. Every database event has the same operation type and structure as the change event object that was emitted by the underlying change stream. Change events have the following operation types: Operation Type\nDescription\nINSERT\nRepresents a new document added to the collection.\nUPDATE\nRepresents a change to an existing document in the collection.\nREPLACE\nRepresents a new document that replaced a document in the collection.\nDELETE\nRepresents a document deleted from the collection. Database change event objects have the following general form: {   _id : <ObjectId>,   \"operationType\": <string>,   \"fullDocument\": <document>,   \"fullDocumentBeforeChange\": <document>,   \"ns\": {      \"db\" : <string>,      \"coll\" : <string>   },   \"documentKey\": {     \"_id\": <ObjectId>   },   \"updateDescription\": <document>,   \"clusterTime\": <Timestamp>}  \nSUSPENDED TRIGGERS \nDatabase Triggers may enter a suspended state in response to an event that prevents the Trigger's change stream from continuing. Events that can suspend a Trigger include:  * invalidate events such as dropDatabase, renameCollection, or those caused by a network disruption.  * the resume token required to resume the change stream is no longer in the cluster oplog. The App logs refer to this as a ChangeStreamHistoryLost error. In the event of a suspended or failed trigger, Atlas App Services sends the project owner an email alerting them of the issue. \nAUTOMATICALLY RESUME A SUSPENDED TRIGGER \nYou can configure a Trigger to automatically resume if the Trigger was suspended because the resume token is no longer in the oplog. The Trigger does not process any missed change stream events between when the resume token is lost and when the resume process completes.

You can adjust the oplog size to keep the resume token for more time after a suspension by scaling your Atlas cluster. Maintain an oplog size a few times greater than your cluster's peak oplog throughput (GB/hour) to reduce the risk of a suspended trigger's resume token dropping off the oplog before the trigger executes. View your cluster's oplog throughput in the Oplog GB/Hour graph in the Atlas cluster metrics. You can attempt to restart a suspended Trigger from the App Services UI or by importing an application directory with realm-cli.   LAST CLUSTER TIME PROCESSED \nAll Triggers keep track of the last time the Trigger executed, known as the latest execution in the App Services UI. Database Triggers also keep track of the last cluster time processed: the last time the change stream backing that Trigger emitted an event. You can access these timestamps in the list of Triggers that displays when you first navigate to the Triggers section from the sidebar. The difference between the latest execution and the last cluster time processed represents the latency between when an event occurs in your database, and when the Trigger finishes responding to that event. If latency is consistently large, you can reduce it with the following mitigations:  * Optimize the Trigger's Linked Function to speed up execution.  * If your Trigger uses Event Ordering, consider switching ordering off to reduce latency.  * Add resources by upgrading your MongoDB Atlas cluster. \nEXAMPLE \nAn online store wants to notify its customers whenever one of their orders changes location. They record each order in the store.orders collection as a document that resembles the following: {  _id: ObjectId(\"59cf1860a95168b8f685e378\"),  customerId: ObjectId(\"59cf17e1a95168b8f685e377\"),  orderDate: ISODate(\"2018-06-26T16:20:42.313Z\"),  shipDate: ISODate(\"2018-06-27T08:20:23.311Z\"),  orderContents: [    { qty: 1, name: \"Earl Grey Tea Bags - 100ct\", price: NumberDecimal(\"10.99\") }  ],  shippingLocation: [    { location: \"Memphis\", time: ISODate(\"2018-06-27T18:22:33.243Z\") },  ]}  To automate this process, the store creates a database Trigger that listens for UPDATE change events in the store.orders collection. When the trigger observes an UPDATE event, it passes the change event object to its associated Function, textShippingUpdate. The Function checks the change event for any changes to the shippingLocation field and, if it was updated, sends a text message to the customer with the new location of the order.  textShippingUpdate exports = async function (changeEvent) {  // Destructure out fields from the change stream event object  const { updateDescription, fullDocument } = changeEvent;\n  // Check if the shippingLocation field was updated  const updatedFields = Object.keys(updateDescription.updatedFields);  const isNewLocation = updatedFields.some(field =>    field.match(/shippingLocation/)  );\n  // If the location changed, text the customer the updated location.  if (isNewLocation) {    const { customerId, shippingLocation } = fullDocument;    const twilio = context.services.get(\"myTwilioService\");    const mongodb = context.services.get(\"mongodb-atlas\");    const customers = mongodb.db(\"store\").collection(\"customers\");\n    const { location } = shippingLocation.pop();    const customer = await customers.findOne({ _id: customer_id })    twilio.send({      to: customer.phoneNumber,      from: context.values.get(\"ourPhoneNumber\"),      body: `Your order has moved! The new location is ${location}.`    });  }};  \nPERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION  DISABLE EVENT ORDERING FOR BURST OPERATIONS \nConsider disabling event ordering if your trigger fires on a collection that

Example\n * Performance Optimization\n * Additional Examples Scheduled triggers allow you to execute server-side logic on a regular schedule that you define. You can use scheduled triggers to do work that happens on a periodic basis, such as updating a document every minute, generating a nightly report, or sending an automated weekly email newsletter. \nCREATE A SCHEDULED TRIGGER   \nCONFIGURATION \nScheduled Triggers have the following configuration options: Field\nDescription\nTrigger Type\ntype: <string> Required. The type of the Trigger. For scheduled Triggers, this value should be set to SCHEDULED. Trigger Name\nname: <string>\nRequired. The name of the Trigger.\nLinked Function\nfunction_name: <string> Required. The name of the Function that the Trigger executes whenever it fires. \nNOTE A scheduled Trigger does not pass any arguments to its linked Function. Schedule\nconfig.schedule: <string>\nRequired. The CRON expression that Atlas App Services uses to determine when to fire the Trigger. \nCRON EXPRESSIONS \nCRON expressions are user-defined strings that use standard cron job syntax to define when a scheduled trigger should execute. App Services executes Trigger CRON expressions based on UTC time. Whenever all of the fields in a CRON expression match the current date and time, App Services fires the trigger associated with the expression. \nEXPRESSION SYNTAX  FORMAT \nCRON expressions are strings composed of five space-delimited fields. Each field defines a granular portion of the schedule on which its associated trigger executes: * * * * *│ │ │ │ └── weekday...........[0 (SUN) - 6 (SAT)]│ │ │ └──── month.............[1 (JAN) - 12 (DEC)]│ │ └────── dayOfMonth........[1 - 31]│ └──────── hour..............[0 - 23]└────────── minute............[0 - 59] \nField\nValid Values\nDescription\nminute\n[0 - 59] Represents one or more minutes within an hour. \nEXAMPLE If the minute field of a CRON expression has a value of 10, the field matches any time ten minutes after the hour (e.g. 9:10 AM). hour\n[0 - 23] Represents one or more hours within a day on a 24-hour clock. \nEXAMPLE If the hour field of a CRON expression has a value of 15, the field matches any time between 3:00 PM and 3:59 PM. dayOfMonth\n[1 - 31] Represents one or more days within a month. \nEXAMPLE If the dayOfMonth field of a CRON expression has a value of 3, the field matches any time on the third day of the month. month\n1 (JAN) 7 (JUL)\n2 (FEB) 8 (AUG)\n3 (MAR) 9 (SEP)\n4 (APR) 10 (OCT)\n5 (MAY) 11 (NOV)\n6 (JUN) 12 (DEC) Represents one or more months within a year. A month can be represented by either a number (e.g. 2 for February) or a three-letter string (e.g. APR for April). \nEXAMPLE If the month field of a CRON expression has a value of 9, the field matches any time in the month of September. weekday\n0 (SUN)\n1 (MON)\n2 (TUE)\n3 (WED)\n4 (THU)\n5 (FRI)\n6 (SAT) Represents one or more days within a week. A weekday can be represented by either a number (e.g. 2 for a Tuesday) or a three-letter string (e.g. THU for a Thursday). \nEXAMPLE If the weekday field of a CRON expression has a value of 3, the field matches any time on a Wednesday. \nFIELD VALUES \nEach field in a CRON expression can contain either a specific value or an expression that evaluates to a set of values. The following table describes valid field values and expressions: Expression Type\nDescription\nAll Values\n(*) Matches all possible field values.

They record all orders in the store.orders collection as documents that resemble the following: {  _id: ObjectId(\"59cf1860a95168b8f685e378\"),  customerId: ObjectId(\"59cf17e1a95168b8f685e377\"),  orderDate: ISODate(\"2018-06-26T16:20:42.313Z\"),  shipDate: ISODate(\"2018-06-27T08:20:23.311Z\"),  orderContents: [    { qty: 1, name: \"Earl Grey Tea Bags - 100ct\", price: Decimal128(\"10.99\") }  ],  shippingLocation: [    { location: \"Memphis\", time: ISODate(\"2018-06-27T18:22:33.243Z\") },  ]}  To generate the daily report, the store creates a scheduled Trigger that fires every day at 7:00 AM UTC. When the Trigger fires, it calls its linked Atlas Function, generateDailyReport, which runs an aggregation query on the store.orders collection to generate the report.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nCONVERT WEBHOOKS TO HTTPS ENDPOINTS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Automatically Convert Existing HTTP Webhooks\n * Manually Convert GitHub and Twilio Webhooks\n * GitHub Webhooks\n * Twilio Webhooks\n * Update Callback URLs in Client Apps & Services\n * Differences between Webhooks and Their Converted Endpoints \nOVERVIEW \nThe Atlas App Services third-party service webhooks are deprecated in favor of custom HTTPS endpoints. HTTPS endpoints are functionally almost identical to webhooks but are now a first-class service. This guide walks through converting your app's existing webhooks and updating external apps that call them. For new webhooks or callback URLs, you should define an HTTPS endpoint. \nAUTOMATICALLY CONVERT EXISTING HTTP WEBHOOKS \nApp Services can automatically convert any existing HTTP service webhooks in your app into HTTPS endpoints. This conversion is one-way which means that you cannot convert HTTPS endpoints back into webhooks. The conversion process does not delete the original webhooks so incoming webhook requests will continue to execute after the conversion. To run the webhook to HTTPS endpoint conversion process for all webhooks in your application:       1. Click HTTPS Endpoints in the left navigation menu of the App Services UI.  2. Click the Convert button.  3. Confirm that you want to run the conversion.  \nNOTE The converted HTTPS endpoints are independent from their source webhooks. If you choose to edit a webhook after running the conversion, you can run the conversion again with the \"Convert & Override\" option to propogate those changes to your new endpoints. \nMANUALLY CONVERT GITHUB AND TWILIO WEBHOOKS \nApp Services cannot automatically convert GitHub and Twilio webhooks to HTTPS endpoints because they use deprecated client libraries. However, you can manually migrate webhooks from these services to new HTTPS endpoints. \nGITHUB WEBHOOKS \nTo migrate a GitHub webhook to an HTTPS endpoint:  1. Create a new HTTPS endpoint  2. Copy the existing GitHub webhook code into the new endpoint's function  3. Update your code to parse the incoming request body instead of using the pre-parsed GitHub payload.\n    \n    Before: A GitHub webhook with a pre-parsed payload\n    \n    exports = async function(payload, response) {  // Webhooks only provide the parsed request body  const { commits, pusher, repository } = payload;\n      // ... your code here}\n    \n    \n    After: An HTTPS endpoint that parses the GitHub payload\n    \n    exports = async function(payload, response) {  // Endpoints pass an entire request payload, not just a parsed body  const { commits, pusher, repository } = JSON.parse(payload.body.text());\n      // ... your code here}\n    \n     \nTWILIO WEBHOOKS \nTo migrate a Twilio webhook to an HTTPS endpoint:  1.

Payload\n * Example Webhook Function\n * Configure GitHub\n * Add a Webhook to a GitHub Repository \nIMPORTANT \nTHIRD PARTY SERVICES & PUSH NOTIFICATIONS DEPRECATION Third party services and push notifications in App Services have been deprecated in favor of creating HTTP endpoints that use external dependencies in functions. Webhooks have been renamed to HTTPS Endpoints with no change in behavior. You should migrate existing Webhooks. Existing services will continue to work until 1 Aug 2023. Because third party services and push notifications are now deprecated, they have been removed by default from the App Services UI. If you need to manage an existing third party service or push notification, you can add the configurations back to the UI by doing the following:      * In the left navigation, under the Manage section, click App Settings.  * Enable the toggle switch next to Temporarily Re-Enable 3rd Party Services, and then save your changes. \nOVERVIEW \nGitHub is a web-based development platform for hosting and reviewing Git repositories. The Atlas App Services GitHub service allows your application to react to events in a GitHub repository, such as new pull requests or issues. \nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS \nYou will need to provide values for the following parameters when you create a GitHub service interface:  Parameter\nDescription\nService Name\nconfig.name\nThe name of this GitHub service interface. This must be unique from all other service interfaces in your application. \nSERVICE ACTIONS \nGitHub Services do not provide any service actions. Use an incoming webhook to respond to events in your GitHub repo. \nINCOMING WEBHOOKS  NOTE \nCONVERT GITHUB WEBHOOKS TO ENDPOINTS GitHub Service webhoooks are deprecated in favor of custom HTTPS endpoints. To learn how to migrate your existing GitHub webhooks to endpoints, see Convert Webhooks to HTTPS Endpoints. GitHub can invoke one or more webhooks whenever a particular event occurs in a repository. If you'd like to learn more about GitHub's webhook functionality, including detailed reference information about GitHub event types, see GitHub's Webhook documentation. \nCONFIGURATION  \nConfiguration Value\nDescription\nWebhook Name\nname\nRequired. The name of the webhook. Each incoming webhook in a GitHub service interface must have a unique name.\nRespond With Result\nrespond_result\nRequired. If true, App Services sends the return value of the webhook function to GitHub in the response body.\nRun Webhook As\nrun_as_user_id\nrun_as_user_id_script_source Optional. The id of the App Services user that executes the webhook function when the webhook is called.  Request Validation\nconfig.secret\nThe GitHub Secret string that GitHub includes with incoming requests to prove that the requests are valid. You must specify this value in the settings of your GitHub repo when you provide a webhook URL. \nREQUEST PAYLOAD \nApp Services automatically passes a payload document as the first argument to incoming webhook functions. In a GitHub Service incoming webhook the payload object represents the GitHub event that caused GitHub to call the webhook. \nNOTE The exact content of GitHub payload documents varies depending on the event type that it represents. For a detailed description of a specific event type's payload document, refer to GitHub's Event Types & Payloads documentation. \nEXAMPLE WEBHOOK FUNCTION \nThe following webhook function inserts incoming data into a MongoDB collection. exports = function(payload) {    const mongodb = context.services.get(\"mongodb-atlas\");    const requestlogs = mongodb.database(\"test\").collection(\"requestlogs\");\n    return requestlogs      .insertOne({        \"commits\": payload.commits,        \"pushed_by\": payload.pusher,        \"repo\": payload.repository.html_url      })      .then(({ insertedId }) => `Inserted document with _id: ${insertedId}`)}  The payload document is passed by the GitHub service and contains information from the request. \nCONFIGURE GITHUB  ADD A WEBHOOK TO A GITHUB REPOSITORY \n 1.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nHTTP SERVICE [DEPRECATED] \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Configuration Parameters\n * Service Actions\n * Incoming Webhooks\n * Configuration\n * Request Payload\n * Example Webhook Function \nIMPORTANT \nTHIRD PARTY SERVICES & PUSH NOTIFICATIONS DEPRECATION Third party services and push notifications in App Services have been deprecated in favor of creating HTTP endpoints that use external dependencies in functions. Webhooks have been renamed to HTTPS Endpoints with no change in behavior. You should migrate existing Webhooks. Existing services will continue to work until 1 Aug 2023. Because third party services and push notifications are now deprecated, they have been removed by default from the App Services UI. If you need to manage an existing third party service or push notification, you can add the configurations back to the UI by doing the following:      * In the left navigation, under the Manage section, click App Settings.  * Enable the toggle switch next to Temporarily Re-Enable 3rd Party Services, and then save your changes. \nOVERVIEW \nThe Atlas App Services HTTP Service is a generic interface that enables you to communicate with any service that is available over HTTP, such as those that provide a REST API. This is useful when you need to use a service that does not have a custom service built-in to App Services.  * To send an outbound HTTP request, call one of the HTTP actions.  * To handle incoming requests from an external service, configure an incoming webhook and provide it to the service, if possible. See the incoming webhooks section on this page for an example. \nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS \nYou will need to provide values for the following parameters when you create an HTTP service interface:  Parameter\nDescription\nService Name\nconfig.name\nThe name of this HTTP service interface. This must be unique from all other service interfaces in your application. \nSERVICE ACTIONS \nThe HTTP service in App Services provides the following actions that you can call in functions and in the SDKs. Each action maps to a standard HTTP request method. For instructions on using an HTTP service action, see Call a Service Action. \nNOTE You must enable a service action in a service rule before you can call it. Action\nDescription\nhttp.get()\nSend an HTTP GET request.\nhttp.post()\nSend an HTTP POST request.\nhttp.put()\nSend an HTTP PUT request.\nhttp.patch()\nSend an HTTP PATCH request.\nhttp.delete()\nSend an HTTP DELETE request.\nhttp.head()\nSend an HTTP HEAD request. \nINCOMING WEBHOOKS  NOTE \nCONVERT HTTP WEBHOOKS TO ENDPOINTS HTTP Service webhoooks are deprecated in favor of custom HTTPS endpoints.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nREPLACE SERVICES WITH NPM MODULES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * HTTP Service\n * node-fetch\n * axios\n * Twilio Service\n * AWS Service\n * S3\n * Kinesis\n * Lambda\n * SES \nOVERVIEW \nYou should migrate deprecated third-party service integrations to use the corresponding official libraries available from npm. The sections later on this page contain details and examples for each service. To migrate from a deprecated service:       1. Add a library for the service from npm to your app.  2. Import the library in your functions. Replace any calls to the built-in service actions with calls to the corresponding methods in the imported library.  3. If the service has webhooks, convert them to HTTPS endpoints. \nHTTP SERVICE \nReplace HTTP requests sent through an HTTP Service client with calls to an HTTP library like node-fetch or axios. \nNODE-FETCH \nnpm i node-fetch@^2  \nIMPORTANT Atlas App Services does not support v3 of node-fetch.

 \nPARAMETERS \nfind(   query?: object,   projection?: object,   options?: object): Cursor \nParameter\nType\nDescription\nquery\nobject Optional. A query filter that specifies which documents to find. Specify an empty query ({}) or omit this parameter to match all documents in the collection. You can use most query selectors except for evaluation, geospatial, or bitwise selectors. You may only use these selectors in system functions. projection\nobject Optional. A document that specifies which fields MongoDB should include or omit in matching documents. To return all fields in the matching documents, omit this parameter or specify an empty projection document ({}). To return specific fields and the document's _id, specify the fields in the projection document with a value of 1: // Includes the field in returned documents{ <Field Name>: 1 }  To withhold specific fields, specify the fields in the projection document with a value of 0: // Withholds the field from returned documents{ <Field Name>: 0 }  \nNOTE You may specify either fields to include or fields to withhold but not both. For example, the following projection is invalid because it simultaneously includes the name field and withholds the address field: // Invalid// Can't simultaneously include and withhold{ \"name\": 1, \"address\": 0 }  The exception to this rule is the _id field, which you may withhold from any query: // Valid// Can exclude _id while including other fields{ \"_id\": 0, \"name\": 1 } \noptions\nobject\nAn object that specifies additional configuration options.\noptions.session\nClientSession Optional. A session object that represents the transaction context in which the operation occurs. To learn more, see Transactions. \nRETURN VALUE \nThe collection.find() method returns a cursor object that points to any documents that match the specified query. You can manipulate and access documents in the query result set with the following cursor methods: Method\nDescription\ncursor.next() Iterates the cursor and returns a Promise that resolves to the next document in the cursor. If the cursor is exhausted, the promise resolves to undefined. \nEXAMPLE collection.find().next()  .then(doc => console.log(\"next document\", doc)) \ncursor.toArray() Iterates the cursor to exhaustion and returns a Promise that resolves to an array that contains all of the iterated documents. \nEXAMPLE collection.find().toArray()  .then(docs => console.log(\"all documents\", docs)) \ncursor.skip(amount) Specifies a number of matching documents to omit from the query result set. MongoDB omits documents from the result set in sort order until it has skipped the specified number. If the query also specifies a limit, skipped documents do not count towards the limit threshold. \nNOTE You cannot call this method after retrieving one or more documents using cursor.next() or cursor.toArray(). cursor.limit(limit) Specifies the maximum number of documents to include in the query result set. If the result set contains more documents than the specified limit, the cursor will return documents in order up to the limit. \nNOTE You cannot call this method after retrieving one or more documents using cursor.next() or cursor.toArray(). cursor.sort(sort) Sorts documents in the result set according to the sort filter. Sort documents specify one or more fields to sort on. The value of each field indicates whether MongoDB should sort it in ascending (1) or descending (-1) order. For more information, see cursor.sort. \nNOTE You cannot call this method after retrieving one or more documents using cursor.next() or cursor.toArray(). \nEXAMPLE The following sort document specifies that documents should be sorted first by age from highest to lowest. Once sorted by age, the result set should further be sorted by name in alphabetical order for each distinct age value. { age: -1, name: 1 }  \nNOTE You cannot return a cursor from a function. Instead, evaluate the cursor using cursor.next() or cursor.toArray() and return the result. \nCOLLECTION.FINDONE() \ncollection.findOne() \nFinds a single document from a collection or view.

 \nPARAMETERS \nfindOne(   query?: object,   projection?: object,   options?: object): Promise<object | null> \nParameter\nType\nDescription\nquery\nobject Optional. A query filter that specifies which documents to find. Specify an empty query ({}) or omit this parameter to match all documents in the collection. You can use most query selectors except for evaluation, geospatial, or bitwise selectors. You may only use these selectors in system functions. projection\nobject Optional. A document that specifies which fields MongoDB should include or omit in matching documents. To return all fields in the matching documents, omit this parameter or specify an empty projection document ({}). To return specific fields and the document's _id, specify the fields in the projection document with a value of 1: // Includes the field in returned documents{ <Field Name>: 1 }  To withhold specific fields, specify the fields in the projection document with a value of 0: // Withholds the field from returned documents{ <Field Name>: 0 }  \nNOTE You may specify either fields to include or fields to withhold but not both. For example, the following projection is invalid because it simultaneously includes the name field and withholds the address field: // Invalid// Can't simultaneously include and withhold{ \"name\": 1, \"address\": 0 }  The exception to this rule is the _id field, which you may withhold from any query: // Valid// Can exclude _id while including other fields{ \"_id\": 0, \"name\": 1 } \noptions\nobject\nAn object that specifies additional configuration options.\noptions.session\nClientSession Optional. A session object that represents the transaction context in which the operation occurs. To learn more, see Transactions. \nRETURN VALUE \nThe collection.findOne() method returns a Promise that resolves to the first document in the collection that matches the query. If no documents match the specified query, the promise resolves to null. Promise<object | null>  \nCOLLECTION.FINDONEANDUPDATE() \ncollection.findOneAndUpdate() \nUpdates a single document in a collection or view and returns the document in either its pre-update or post-update form. Unlike collection.updateOne(), this action allows you to atomically find, modify, and return a document with the same command. This avoids the risk of other update operations changing the document between separate find and update operations. // Find the document that describes \"lego\"const query = { \"name\": \"lego\" };// Set some fields in that documentconst update = {  \"$set\": {    \"name\": \"blocks\",    \"price\": 20.99,    \"category\": \"toys\"  }};// Return the updated document instead of the original documentconst options = { returnNewDocument: true };\nreturn itemsCollection.findOneAndUpdate(query, update, options)  .then(updatedDocument => {    if(updatedDocument) {      console.log(`Successfully updated document: ${updatedDocument}.`)    } else {      console.log(\"No document matches the provided query.\")    }    return updatedDocument  })  .catch(err => console.error(`Failed to find and update document: ${err}`))  \nPARAMETERS \nfindOneAndUpdate(   query: object,   update: object,   options?: object): Promise<object | null> \nParameter\nType\nDescription\nquery\nobject A query filter that specifies which documents to find. Specify an empty query ({}) or omit this parameter to match all documents in the collection. You can use most query selectors except for evaluation, geospatial, or bitwise selectors. You may only use these selectors in system functions. update\nobject An update document that specifies modifications to perform using MongoDB update operators. options\nobject\nAn object that specifies additional configuration options.\noptions.upsert\nboolean Optional. Default: false. A boolean that, if true, indicates that MongoDB should insert a new document that matches the query when the query does not match any existing documents in the collection. options.sort\nboolean Optional. Specifies the query sort order. You can specify one or more fields to sort on where the value of each field indicates whether MongoDB should sort it in ascending (1) or descending (-1) order. \nEXAMPLE The following sort document specifies that documents should be sorted first by age from highest to lowest.

A document that specifies which fields MongoDB should include or omit in matching documents. To return all fields in the matching documents, omit this parameter or specify an empty projection document ({}). To return specific fields and the document's _id, specify the fields in the projection document with a value of 1: // Includes the field in returned documents{ <Field Name>: 1 }  To withhold specific fields, specify the fields in the projection document with a value of 0: // Withholds the field from returned documents{ <Field Name>: 0 }  \nNOTE You may specify either fields to include or fields to withhold but not both. For example, the following projection is invalid because it simultaneously includes the name field and withholds the address field: // Invalid// Can't simultaneously include and withhold{ \"name\": 1, \"address\": 0 }  The exception to this rule is the _id field, which you may withhold from any query: // Valid// Can exclude _id while including other fields{ \"_id\": 0, \"name\": 1 } \noptions.returnNewDocument\nboolean Optional. Default: false. If true, the method returns the modified document in its updated form instead of its original, pre-update form. options.session\nClientSession Optional. A session object that represents the transaction context in which the operation occurs. To learn more, see Transactions. \nRETURN VALUE \nThe collection.findOneAndUpdate() method returns a Promise that resolves to a single document that the query overwrote. If no documents match the specified query, the promise resolves to null. Promise<object | null>  \nNOTE You can specify whether to return the pre-replacement or post-replacement version of the document by setting the value of options.returnNewDocument. By default, returnNewDocument is false, which indicates that the promise should resolve to the pre-update version of the document. \nCOLLECTION.FINDONEANDREPLACE() \ncollection.findOneAndReplace() \nOverwrites a single document in a collection or view and returns the document in either its pre-replacement or post-replacement form. Unlike collection.updateOne(), this action allows you to atomically find, modify, and return a document with the same command. This avoids the risk of other update operations changing the document between separate find and update operations. // Find the document that describes \"lego\"const query = { \"name\": \"lego\" };// Replace it with a new documentconst replacement = {    \"name\": \"blocks\",    \"price\": 20.99,    \"category\": \"toys\"};// Return the original document as it was before being replacedconst options = { \"returnNewDocument\": false };\nreturn itemsCollection.findOneAndReplace(query, replacement, options)  .then(replacedDocument => {    if(replacedDocument) {      console.log(`Successfully replaced the following document: ${replacedDocument}.`)    } else {      console.log(\"No document matches the provided query.\")    }    return updatedDocument  })  .catch(err => console.error(`Failed to find and replace document: ${err}`))  \nPARAMETERS \nfindOneAndReplace(   query: object,   replacement: object,   options?: object): Promise<object | null> \nParameter\nType\nDescription\nquery\nobject A query filter that specifies which documents to find. Specify an empty query ({}) or omit this parameter to match all documents in the collection. You can use most query selectors except for evaluation, geospatial, or bitwise selectors. You may only use these selectors in system functions. replacement\nobject A document that will replace the matching document. The replacement document cannot contain any MongoDB update operators. options\nobject\nAn object that specifies additional configuration options.\noptions.upsert\nboolean Optional. Default: false. A boolean that, if true, indicates that MongoDB should insert a new document that matches the query when the query does not match any existing documents in the collection. options.sort\nboolean Optional. Specifies the query sort order. You can specify one or more fields to sort on where the value of each field indicates whether MongoDB should sort it in ascending (1) or descending (-1) order. \nEXAMPLE The following sort document specifies that documents should be sorted first by age from highest to lowest.

To return all fields in the matching documents, omit this parameter or specify an empty projection document ({}). To return specific fields and the document's _id, specify the fields in the projection document with a value of 1: // Includes the field in returned documents{ <Field Name>: 1 }  To withhold specific fields, specify the fields in the projection document with a value of 0: // Withholds the field from returned documents{ <Field Name>: 0 }  \nNOTE You may specify either fields to include or fields to withhold but not both. For example, the following projection is invalid because it simultaneously includes the name field and withholds the address field: // Invalid// Can't simultaneously include and withhold{ \"name\": 1, \"address\": 0 }  The exception to this rule is the _id field, which you may withhold from any query: // Valid// Can exclude _id while including other fields{ \"_id\": 0, \"name\": 1 } \noptions.returnNewDocument\nboolean Optional. Default: false. If true, the method returns the modified document in its updated form instead of its original, pre-update form. options.session\nClientSession Optional. A session object that represents the transaction context in which the operation occurs. To learn more, see Transactions. \nRETURN VALUE \nThe collection.findOneAndReplace() method returns a Promise that resolves to a single document that the query overwrote. If no documents match the specified query, the promise resolves to null. Promise<object | null>  \nNOTE You can specify whether to return the pre-replacement or post-replacement version of the document by setting the value of options.returnNewDocument. By default, returnNewDocument is false, which indicates that the promise should resolve to the pre-update version of the document. \nCOLLECTION.FINDONEANDDELETE() \ncollection.findOneAndDelete() \nRemoves a single document from a collection and returns the deleted document as it was immediately before it was deleted. Unlike collection.updateOne(), this action allows you to atomically find, modify, and return a document with the same command. This avoids the risk of other update operations changing the document between separate find and update operations. // Find the first document that has a quantity greater than 25const query = { \"quantity\": { \"$gte\": 25 } };// Sort the documents in order of descending quantity before// deleting the first one.const options = {  \"sort\": { \"quantity\": -1 }}\nreturn itemsCollection.findOneAndDelete(query, options)  .then(deletedDocument => {    if(deletedDocument) {      console.log(`Successfully deleted document that had the form: ${deletedDocument}.`)    } else {      console.log(\"No document matches the provided query.\")    }    return deletedDocument  })  .catch(err => console.error(`Failed to find and delete document: ${err}`))  \nPARAMETERS \nfindOneAndDelete(   query: object,   options?: object): Promise<object | null> \nParameter\nType\nDescription\nquery\nobject A query filter that specifies which documents to find. Specify an empty query ({}) or omit this parameter to match all documents in the collection. You can use most query selectors except for evaluation, geospatial, or bitwise selectors. You may only use these selectors in system functions. options\nobject\nAn object that specifies additional configuration options.\noptions.sort\nboolean Optional. Specifies the query sort order. You can specify one or more fields to sort on where the value of each field indicates whether MongoDB should sort it in ascending (1) or descending (-1) order. \nEXAMPLE The following sort document specifies that documents should be sorted first by age from highest to lowest. Once sorted by age, the result set should further be sorted by name in alphabetical order for each distinct age value. { age: -1, name: 1 } \noptions.projection\nboolean A document that specifies which fields MongoDB should include or omit in matching documents. To return all fields in the matching documents, omit this parameter or specify an empty projection document ({}). To return specific fields and the document's _id, specify the fields in the projection document with a value of 1: // Includes the field in returned documents{ <Field Name>: 1 }  To withhold specific

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nAWS SERVICE [DEPRECATED] \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Configuration Parameters\n * Service Actions\n * AWS Service Rules\n * Rule Conditions\n * Example\n * Usage\n * Call an AWS Service from an Atlas Function\n * Supported AWS Services \nIMPORTANT \nTHIRD PARTY SERVICES & PUSH NOTIFICATIONS DEPRECATION Third party services and push notifications in App Services have been deprecated in favor of creating HTTP endpoints that use external dependencies in functions. Webhooks have been renamed to HTTPS Endpoints with no change in behavior. You should migrate existing Webhooks. Existing services will continue to work until 1 Aug 2023. Because third party services and push notifications are now deprecated, they have been removed by default from the App Services UI. If you need to manage an existing third party service or push notification, you can add the configurations back to the UI by doing the following:      * In the left navigation, under the Manage section, click App Settings.  * Enable the toggle switch next to Temporarily Re-Enable 3rd Party Services, and then save your changes. \nOVERVIEW \nAmazon Web Services (AWS) provides an extensive collection of cloud-based services. Atlas App Services provides a generic AWS service that enables you to connect to many of these services. \nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS \nYou will need to provide values for the following parameters when you create an AWS service interface:  Parameter\nDescription\nService Name\nconfig.name\nA unique name for the service.\nAccess Key ID\nconfig.accessKeyId\nThe access key ID for an AWS IAM user. The user should have programmatic access and appropriate permissions for all AWS services that you plan to interact with.\nSecret Access Key\nsecret_config.secretAccessKey\nThe name of a Secret that stores a secret access key for the IAM user whose ID is specified in Access Key ID. You can find this value next to the Access key ID when you create a new IAM user or create a new access key for an existing IAM user. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO:  * Managing Access Keys for Your AWS Account  * Create IAM Users \nSERVICE ACTIONS \nEach AWS service has different actions that you can perform on that service. App Services uses the action names specified in the AWS SDK for Go for each service. \nNOTE App Services uses the same names (and casing) for the AWS services and actions as the AWS Go SDK. For each supported AWS service, App Services supports any action that:  1. Takes a single input parameter.  2. Returns one of two objects: an output object, or an error. For example, the S3 service includes a PutObject action. App Services supports this action because it takes a single input type of PutObjectInput, and returns either a PutObjectOutput or an error. \nAWS SERVICE RULES \nYou must specify rules to enable the AWS services and actions. Each rule applies to a single service API, plus one or all actions on that service. As with other service rules in App Services, a rule must evaluate to true to enable the action. For example, the following rule enables all actions on the Kinesis service:  \nNOTE The default value of the When field contains only empty brackets, which means the rule will always evaluate to true, and therefore all calls to the action are valid. This rule can also be expressed as the following rule expression. Note that in the array of actions, the asterisk (*) after the service name indicates that all actions of that service are enabled: {   \"name\": \"kinesis\",   \"actions\": [      \"kinesis:*\"   ]}  \nRULE CONDITIONS \nFor each service action, the rule you create may include any of the properties of the input object for that action as a condition for validating the rule. The %%args expansion provides access to these properties. \nEXAMPLE \nS3 PUTOBJECT \nThe S3 service includes the PutObject action, which takes an input object of type of PutObjectInput. You can reference any of the properties on the PutObjectInput object in a rule's When expression with the %%args expansion. Using the Bucket property of the PutObjectInput object, you can create a rule that enables the PutObject action on the S3 service, but restricts the action to a list of approved buckets.

 S3 GETOBJECT \nThe S3 service includes the GetObject action, which takes an input object of type of GetObjectInput. You can reference any of the properties on the GetObjectInput object in a rule's When expression with the %%args expansion. In the following example, we create a rule that enables the GetObject action on a specific bucket called realmReadWritableBucket:  This can also be expressed as the following JSON: {   \"name\": \"s3\",   \"actions\": [      \"s3:GetObject\"   ],   \"when\": {      \"%%args.Bucket\": {            \"$in\": \"realmReadWritableBucket\"      }   }}  \nUSAGE \nYou can call an AWS service from an Atlas Function and from the SDKs. The following sections show each of these processes. \nCALL AN AWS SERVICE FROM AN ATLAS FUNCTION \nThe following examples show how to call various AWS services from within an Atlas Function.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nGITHUB SNIPPETS [DEPRECATED] \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Log All Commits in MongoDB\n * Automatically Comment On New Pull Requests \nIMPORTANT \nTHIRD PARTY SERVICES & PUSH NOTIFICATIONS DEPRECATION Third party services and push notifications in App Services have been deprecated in favor of creating HTTP endpoints that use external dependencies in functions. Webhooks have been renamed to HTTPS Endpoints with no change in behavior. You should migrate existing Webhooks. Existing services will continue to work until 1 Aug 2023. Because third party services and push notifications are now deprecated, they have been removed by default from the App Services UI. If you need to manage an existing third party service or push notification, you can add the configurations back to the UI by doing the following:      * In the left navigation, under the Manage section, click App Settings.  * Enable the toggle switch next to Temporarily Re-Enable 3rd Party Services, and then save your changes. \nOVERVIEW \nThe code snippets on this page cover demonstrate how you can respond to events in a GitHub repository through the GitHub Service. All of the snippets require a GitHub Service interface with rules that allow the service actions used in the snippet. If your app does not have a GitHub Service interface, create one before using these snippets. \nLOG ALL COMMITS IN MONGODB \nThis GitHub incoming webhook function records all commits pushed to a repo in MongoDB based on a PushEvent payload from GitHub. exports = async function(pushEvent) {  // Parse the list of commits from the PushEvent payload.  // Also grab the user that pushed the commits and the repo information.  const { commits, pusher, repository } = pushEvent;\n  // Create a new array of log documents, one for each commit  const commitLogs = commits.map(commit => {    return {      commit: commit,      pushed_by: pusher,      repo: {        name: repository.name,        url: repository.url      }    }  })\n  // Get a client for the `GitHubRepo.logs` collection in MongoDB  const mongodb = context.services.get(\"mongodb-atlas\");  const logs = mongodb.db(\"GitHubRepo\").collection(\"commit-logs\");\n  // Insert the log documents in MongoDB  try {    const insertResult = await logs.insertMany(commitLogs)    console.log(insertResult.insertedIds);  } catch(err) {    console.error(err)  }};  \nAUTOMATICALLY COMMENT ON NEW PULL REQUESTS \nThis GitHub incoming webhook function adds a comment to new pull requests that thanks users for submitting. The webhook accepts a PullRequestEvent payload from GitHub and uses an HTTP service client to create a comment through the GitHub

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nWEBHOOK REQUESTS & RESPONSES [DEPRECATED] \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Request Validation Methods\n * Payload Signature Verification\n * Secret as a Query Parameter\n * Webhook Response Object \nIMPORTANT \nTHIRD PARTY SERVICES & PUSH NOTIFICATIONS DEPRECATION Third party services and push notifications in App Services have been deprecated in favor of creating HTTP endpoints that use external dependencies in functions. Webhooks have been renamed to HTTPS Endpoints with no change in behavior. You should migrate existing Webhooks. Existing services will continue to work until 1 Aug 2023. Because third party services and push notifications are now deprecated, they have been removed by default from the App Services UI. If you need to manage an existing third party service or push notification, you can add the configurations back to the UI by doing the following:      * In the left navigation, under the Manage section, click App Settings.  * Enable the toggle switch next to Temporarily Re-Enable 3rd Party Services, and then save your changes. \nOVERVIEW \nDepending on the service, incoming webhooks offer several ways to validate requests and customize the response that Atlas App Services sends back to the external service. \nREQUEST VALIDATION METHODS \nTo validate that a webhook request is coming from a trusted source, some external services require that incoming requests incorporate a secret string in one of several prescribed manners. Other services, like the HTTP service, allow you to optionally require request validation. There are two type of Request Validation for webhooks: Payload Signature Verification and Secret as a Query Parameter. \nNOTE For maximum security, programmatically generate the secret string using a secure package such as the Python secrets module. Make sure that you do not publish the secret or include it in your version control system. \nPAYLOAD SIGNATURE VERIFICATION \nThe Verify Payload Signature request validation option requires that incoming requests include a hexadecimal-encoded HMAC SHA-256 hash generated from the request body and secret string in the X-Hook-Signature header. \nEXAMPLE Consider the following webhook request body and secret: const body = { \"message\":\"MESSAGE\" }const secret = 12345  The following Atlas Function generates the hash for this body and secret: // Generate an HMAC request signatureexports = function(secret, body) {  // secret = the secret validation string  // body = the webhook request body  return utils.crypto.hmac(EJSON.stringify(body), secret, \"sha256\", \"hex\");}// Returns: \"828ee180512eaf8a6229eda7eea72323f68e9c0f0093b11a578b0544c5777862\"  The hash value must be assigned to the X-Hook-Signature HTTP request header on every request: X-Hook-Signature:sha256=<hex-encoded-hash>  To test that the request was properly signed, we could run the following curl command: curl -X POST \\  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\  -H \"X-Hook-Signature:sha256=828ee180512eaf8a6229eda7eea72323f68e9c0f0093b11a578b0544c5777862\" \\  -d '{\"message\":\"MESSAGE\"}' \\  <webhook URL>  \nSECRET AS A QUERY PARAMETER \nThe Require Secret as Query Param request validation option requires that incoming requests include the specified secret string as a query parameter appended to the end of the URL. \nEXAMPLE Consider a webhook configured to use a secret value of 12345. All requests must be made to the webhook URL appended with the secret as a query parameter: <webhook URL>?secret=12345  To test that requests to this URL are properly verified, we could run the following curl command: curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\     -d '{ \"message\": \"HELLO\" }' \\     -X POST '<webhook URL>?secret=12345'  \nWEBHOOK RESPONSE OBJECT \nApp Services automatically passes a response object that represents the webhook's HTTP response as the second argument to webhook Function.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nTWILIO SERVICE [DEPRECATED] \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Configuration Parameters\n * Service Actions\n * Incoming Webhooks\n * Configuration\n * Request Payload\n * Example Webhook Function\n * Configure Twilio\n * Create a Messaging Service\n * Add a Webhook to a Twilio Project \nIMPORTANT \nTHIRD PARTY SERVICES & PUSH NOTIFICATIONS DEPRECATION Third party services and push notifications in App Services have been deprecated in favor of creating HTTP endpoints that use external dependencies in functions. Webhooks have been renamed to HTTPS Endpoints with no change in behavior. You should migrate existing Webhooks. Existing services will continue to work until 1 Aug 2023. Because third party services and push notifications are now deprecated, they have been removed by default from the App Services UI. If you need to manage an existing third party service or push notification, you can add the configurations back to the UI by doing the following:      * In the left navigation, under the Manage section, click App Settings.  * Enable the toggle switch next to Temporarily Re-Enable 3rd Party Services, and then save your changes. \nOVERVIEW \nTwilio provides messaging, voice, and chat services for web and mobile apps. The Atlas App Services Twilio service supports integrating Twilio's Programmable SMS service into your application.  * To send an outbound text message, use the send() action.  * To handle and optionally respond to incoming text messages, create an incoming webhook and add it to a Twilio messaging service. See the incoming webhooks section on this page for an example. \nNOTE To use Twilio with App Services, you must have a Twilio Phone Number registered to a messaging service associated with your Twilio account. You can create a new number from the Numbers page of the Twilio dashboard, or by following Twilio's Programmable SMS Quickstart guide. \nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS \nYou will need to provide values for the following parameters when you create a Twilio service interface:  Parameter\nDescription\nService Name\nconfig.name\nThe name of this Twilio service interface.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nREAD USER METADATA \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Schema\n * Find Users\n * Filter Users\n * View User Data\n * View a User's Devices\n * View a User's Provider Data\n * View a User's Activity Log\n * Summary \nOVERVIEW \nAtlas App Services represents each application user internally with a User Object that includes a unique ID and additional metadata that describes the user. You can access user objects:      * With the App Services UI, CLI, or Admin API to find and filter users.  * In the App Services UI by viewing user data.  * In a Function by accessing the context.user interface.  * In a rule expression with the %%user expansion.  * In Android, iOS, Node, React Native, and .NET client applications using a Realm SDK. \nSCHEMA \nUser objects have the following form: {  \"id\": \"<Unique User ID>\",  \"type\": \"<User Type>\",  \"data\": {    \"<Metadata Field>\": <Value>,    ...  },  \"custom_data\": {    \"<Custom Data Field>\": <Value>,    ...  },  \"identities\": [    {      \"id\": <Unique Identity ID>,      \"provider_type\": \"<Authentication Provider>\",      \"data\": {        \"<Metadata Field>\": <Value>,        ...      }    }  ]} \nField\nType\nDescription\nid\nstring\nA string representation of the ObjectId that uniquely identifies the user.\ntype\nstring The type of the user. The following types are possible: Type\nDescription\n\"normal\"\nThe user is an application user logged in through an authentication provider other than the API Key provider.\n\"server\"\nThe user is a server process logged in with any type of App Services API Key.\n\"system\"\nThe user is the system user that bypasses all rules. data\ndocument A document that contains metadata that describes the user. This field combines the data for all identities associated with the user, so the exact field names and values depend on which authentication providers the user has authenticated with. \nNOTE \nSYSTEM FUNCTIONS HAVE NO USER DATA In system functions, the user.data object is empty. Use context.runningAsSystem() to test if the function is running as a system user. custom_data\ndocument A document from your application's custom user data collection that specifies the user's ID. You can use the custom user data collection to store arbitrary data about your application's users. If you set the name field, App Services populates the username metadata field with the return value of name. App Services automatically fetches a new copy of the data whenever a user refreshes their access token, such as when they log in. The underlying data is a regular MongoDB document, so you can use standard CRUD operations through the MongoDB Atlas service to define and modify the user's custom data. \nNOTE \nAVOID STORING LARGE CUSTOM USER DATA Custom user data is limited to 16MB, the maximum size of a MongoDB document. To avoid hitting this limit, consider storing small and relatively static user data in each custom user data document, such as the user's preferred language or the URL of their avatar image. For data that is large, unbounded, or frequently updated, consider only storing a reference to the data in the custom user document or storing the data with a reference to the user's ID rather than in the custom user document. identities\narray A list of authentication provider identities associated with the user. When a user first logs in with a specific provider, App Services associates the user with an identity object that contains a unique identifier and additional metadata about the user from the provider. For subsequent logins, App Services refreshes the existing identity data but does not create a new identity. Identity objects have the following form: {  \"id\": \"<Unique ID>\",  \"provider_type\": \"<Provider Name>\",  \"data\": {    \"<Metadata Field>\": <Value>,    ...  }} \nField Name\nDescription\nid\nA provider-generated string that uniquely identifies this identity\nprovider_type\nThe type of authentication provider associated with this identity.\ndata\nAdditional metadata from the authentication provider that describes the user. The exact field names and values will vary depending on which authentication providers the user has logged in with.

An access token allows anyone that has the token to use the session it's associated with for up to 30 minutes. A refresh token lets you generate a new access token for a session even if the previous token has already expired. The Realm SDKs automatically manage user access and refresh tokens for you when they connect to App Services. You may want to manage sessions yourself if you're connecting to an API service like the Data API or GraphQL. \nGET A USER SESSION ACCESS TOKEN \nYou can authenticate a user and receive a user access token directly over HTTPS or through a session managed by a Realm SDK. \nGET A USER ACCESS TOKEN OVER HTTPS \nYou can get an access token by sending an authentication request directly to App Services over HTTPS. The authentication endpoint accepts an HTTPS POST request with a JSON body that contains the user's login credentials. If the credentials are valid, the response contains a user access token. 1 FIND YOUR APP'S CLIENT API BASE URL \nYour App's authentication endpoint URL depends on the App's deployment model. Select your App's deployment model to see how to construct the base URL.  \nYou can find the base URL programmatically with the App location endpoint.

 \nGET A USER ACCESS TOKEN FROM A REALM SDK \nIn the Realm SDKs, you can access a logged in user's access token from their User object. The SDKs automatically refresh expired access tokens for SDK operations and you can manually refresh it by calling a method. To learn more, refer to the documentation for your Realm SDK:  * Realm C++ SDK  * Realm Flutter SDK  * Realm Java SDK  * Realm Kotlin SDK  * Realm .NET SDK  * Realm Node.js SDK  * Realm React Native SDK  * Realm Swift SDK  * Web SDK \nREFRESH A USER SESSION ACCESS TOKEN \nAccess tokens expire 30 minutes after they are granted. When an access token expires, you must get a new access token to continue sending requests. You could acquire a new access token by logging the user in again, but that would require the user to re-enter their credentials. Instead, you can use the refresh token associated with the user's session to get a new access token that's valid for another 30 minutes. You get the refresh token in the same response as the access token after a successful login. \nREFRESH A USER ACCESS TOKEN OVER HTTPS \nThe session refresh endpoint accepts a POST request that includes the refresh token in the Authorization header. The endpoint URL depends on your App's deployment model.   REFRESH A USER ACCESS TOKEN FROM A REALM SDK \nThe Realm SDKs automatically refresh a logged in user's access token if the token is expired at the time of a request. The SDKs also allow you to manually refresh a user's access token by calling a method on the User object. To learn more, refer to the documentation for your Realm SDK:  * Realm C++ SDK  * Realm Flutter SDK  * Realm Java SDK  * Realm Kotlin SDK  * Realm .NET SDK  * Realm Node.js SDK  * Realm React Native SDK  * Realm Swift SDK  * Web SDK \nCONFIGURE REFRESH TOKEN EXPIRATION \nBy default, refresh tokens expire 60 days after they are issued. You can configure this time for your App's refresh tokens to be anywhere between 30 minutes and 180 days. There are two exceptions:  * Anonymous user refresh tokens do not expire, though anonymous user accounts are deleted after 90 days of inactivity.  * Custom JWT refresh token expiration is determined by the exp value of the user's JWT. \nNOTE You can currently only configure refresh token expiration with the Admin API. Call your App's Set User Refresh Token Expiration Time Admin API endpoint with the expiration_time_seconds field of the request body set to your desired expiration time. curl -X POST \\  https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/security/refresh_token_expiration \\  --data-raw '{    \"expiration_time_seconds\": 864000  }'  If you successfully update the refresh token expiration time, the endpoint returns a 204 response. \nVERIFY & DECODE A USER ACCESS TOKEN \nYou can decode an access token to verify that it has the correct format and has a valid signature. The decoded response includes other information like when the access token expires.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nDEFINE CUSTOM USER METADATA \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Custom User Data\n * Create and Manage Custom User Data\n * Secure Custom User Data\n * User Creation Function\n * Enable Custom User Data\n * Access Custom User Data from a Client Application\n * Authentication Provider Metadata\n * Configure Authentication Provider Metadata\n * Access User Metadata from a Client Application \nOVERVIEW \nYou can associate custom metadata with each user of your App. For example, you might store a user's preferred language, date of birth, or any other information that you want to associate with the user. You can source the metadata for a user from two sources:      * A collection in MongoDB Atlas that stores custom user data. You can associate each user with a document in the collection by their user ID. You can store arbitrary data in each document.  * An authentication provider. If the provider uses JSON Web Tokens, such as Google, Facebook, or a custom provider, you can define metadata fields in the provider configuration that associate data from the user's JWT with their user account. \nCUSTOM USER DATA \nYou can store arbitrary data about your application users in a MongoDB collection. Your App maps each user to a document in the collection by querying a specific field for the user's ID. When a user authenticates, your App looks up the user's data and includes it in their access token. Consider a user with the ID \"63ed2dbe5960df2af7fd216e\". If your custom user data collection was set up to store the user's ID in the userId field, the user would map to the following document: {  \"_id\": \"63ed2e4fb7f367c92578e526\",  \"user_id\": \"63ed2dbe5960df2af7fd216e\",  \"preferences\": {    \"preferDarkMode\": true  },  \"dateOfBirth\": \"1989-03-11T00:00:00.000Z\"}  When you use custom user data, keep the following things in mind:  * Store One Document Per User: Documents that contain user data must include the user's ID in a specific field. If multiple documents specify the same user's ID, App Services only exposes the data from the document that was inserted first.  * Keep Custom User Data Small: The user's full custom user document is included in their access token. In general, aim to keep custom user data documents small (say, less than 16KB). Other services might limit the HTTP header size, which means that larger custom user data objects can cause integration issues.  * Custom Data May Be Stale: A user's custom data is sourced from a MongoDB collection but is stored in and read from a user's authentication access token. If a user has a valid access token when the underlying document changes, their custom data in that session does not update until they refresh their access token or re-authenticate. \nCREATE AND MANAGE CUSTOM USER DATA \nYou are responsible for managing documents in the custom user data collection. Depending on your use case, you may:  * Automatically create a document for each user when they register for your application using a user creation function. This function runs before the user is issued an access token, so the data you add will be in the access token on their first login.  * Use an authentication trigger to update a user's custom data when they register or log in and to delete their data if their account is deleted. Triggers run asynchronously and may finish after the user's access token is created.  * Use a scheduled trigger to periodically update or delete custom user data.  * Manually create, update, and delete documents in the collection using standard CRUD operations from a Function, a Realm SDK, a MongoDB driver or MongoDB Compass. \nSECURE CUSTOM USER DATA \nIf your App's custom user data includes personal or private user information, you should restrict access to the custom user data collection.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nCREATE AN APP USER \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Identity\n * Link to Existing Accounts\n * Create an Email/Password User\n * Create an Email/Password User in the SDK\n * Manually Create an Email/Password User\n * Confirm a User\n * Re-run the User Confirmation Workflow\n * Summary \nOVERVIEW \nAtlas App Services provides various authentication providers to log users into your app. For most providers, App Services automatically creates a user account the first time a user authenticates through the provider. The only exception is email/password user authentication, which requires registering and confirming a user before the user can authenticate. \nTIP \nAPPLE ACCOUNT DELETION REQUIREMENTS Apple requires that applications distributed through the App Store must give any user who creates an account the option to delete the account. Whether that app uses an authentication method where you must manually register a user, such as email/password authentication, or one that automatically creates a user, such as Sign-In with Apple, an app distributed through the App Store must implement user account deletion. \nIDENTITY \nWhen you first log in with an authentication provider, App Services creates a user object that contains a unique identity ID and provider-specific metadata about the user. \nLINK TO EXISTING ACCOUNTS \nA single user object can have more than one identity. You can use the Realm SDKs to link identities to existing user accounts. This allows users to log in to a single account with more than one provider. For more information, see the documentation on linking identities for your preferred SDK:   CREATE AN EMAIL/PASSWORD USER \nWhen you use email/password user authentication, you must first register a user, which creates the user object. You can register users in your client application using your preferred SDK or you can manually create email/password users. After registering the user, you must confirm the user before they can authenticate. \nCREATE AN EMAIL/PASSWORD USER IN THE SDK \nEach SDK offers an API that enables you to register an email/password user. After registering the user, you must confirm the user before the they can authenticate. For code examples that demonstrate how to manage email/password users in the client application, see the documentation for the Realm SDKs:      * C++ SDK  * Flutter SDK  * Java SDK  * Kotlin SDK  * .NET SDK  * Node SDK  * React Native SDK  * Swift SDK  * Web SDK \nMANUALLY CREATE AN EMAIL/PASSWORD USER \nYou can create a new Email/Password user from the App Services UI, CLI, or Admin API. Manually-created users bypass any configured user confirmation flows. \nTIP Manually creating a user can be useful for testing and debugging your application in development.   CONFIRM A USER \nYou must confirm the email address of new Email/Password users before they are permitted to log into App Services. The exact method of confirmation depends upon your provider configuration, but typically involves a handshake process between the user and your application. You can read more about Email/Password user confirmation at Email/Password Confirmation. Sometimes, users are unable to complete the confirmation process. For example:  * An overzealous spam filter might block App Services email confirmation emails.  * A proxy or web blocker could prevent a user from activating the confirmUser client SDK function via the client application.  * An implementation error could cause the client application's user confirmation page to fail for specific use cases. To help you work around cases like this, you can confirm users manually using the App Services UI or the Admin API:   RE-RUN THE USER CONFIRMATION WORKFLOW \nA few circumstances can lead to incomplete Email/Password user confirmation workflows:  * An email is caught by a spam filter, not delivered due to a bug, or accidentally deleted by a prospective App Services user.  * A custom confirmation function is unable to communicate with an unconfirmed user due to a bug or oversight.  * An unconfirmed user forgot to visit their confirmation link within 30 minutes of receiving their login tokens, and the tokens expired. Users caught in this situation appear stuck in an unconfirmed state. Since an existing account has their email registered to it, users cannot create a new account with the same email address. Also, they cannot log into an account that is not confirmed. Applications that use the built-in email confirmation service of App Services can use the resendConfirmationEmail Client SDK method to send a new email with a new confirmation link to the user, allowing them to confirm their account and log in.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nDEVICE SYNC-COMPATIBLE PERMISSIONS \nOn this page    \n * Sync-Compatible Roles\n   \n * Sync-Compatible Expressions\n * Sync-Compatible Expansions\n * Permission Changes\n * Unified Rules System When using Device Sync (Flexible Mode), there are special considerations when using the permissions system. The older Partition-Based Sync uses a completely different permissions system. See Partition-Based Rules and Permissions if you are using Partition-Based Sync. For a guide to setting up Flexible Sync with common permissions models, see the Device Sync Permissions Guide. \nSYNC-COMPATIBLE ROLES \nIf Device Sync (Flexible Mode) is enabled, an assigned role must be Sync compatible. If the role is not Sync compatible, but its \"apply when\" evaluated to true, other roles are not considered; access is denied. A role is not Sync compatible if any of the following conditions are true:      * document_filters.read or document_filters.write are undefined.  * A document filter, insert, or delete expression: - References a field that is not a queryable field - Uses an expansion other than %%true, %%false, %%values, %%environment, or %%user - Uses the %function operator  * Top-level read, top-level write, or field-level permissions are not boolean literals (true or false).  * Field-level permissions are specified for the _id field. \nSYNC-COMPATIBLE EXPRESSIONS \nWhen Device Sync is enabled, expressions may only refer to the queryable fields of your data model. If a role refers to any other fields, it becomes Sync incompatible and cannot be used with Device Sync. Because a Sync-enabled App assigns roles at the start of a Sync session before any specific documents are queried, you can't refer to a document or its field values in an \"apply when\" expression. \nSYNC-COMPATIBLE EXPANSIONS \nWhen using Device Sync, some expansions are not supported. The following table specifies which expansions are Sync compatible in either the \"apply when\" or rule expressions: Expansion\nCan Use in \"Apply When\"?\nCan Use in Rule Expressions?\n%%true, %%false\nYes\nYes\n%%values, %%environment\nYes\nYes with an important consideration\n%%request\nNo\nNo\n%%user\nYes\nYes with an important consideration\n%%this, %%prev, %%root, %%prevRoot\nNo. These expansions refer to the document. App Services evaluates \"apply when\" expressions at session start, so there's no document to evaluate.\nNo. These expansions might access non-queryable fields of the document, which is not possible.\n%%partition\nNo\nNo\n%stringToOid, %oidToString\nYes\nYes\n%function\nYes\nNo. App Services expands the expansions at the start of the session, so the function would not operate on a per-document basis.\n$exists\nYes\nYes\n$in, $nin\nYes\nYes. However, note that you cannot currently have an array field as a queryable field on a document.\n$eq, $ne, $gt, $gte, $lt, $lte\nYes\nYes \nIMPORTANT App Services causes a client reset if anything about the role changed since the previous session. At the start of a session, App Services expands all expansions in the \"apply when\", document_filters.read, and document_filters.write expressions and stores the result. This has the following implications:  * If the value changes during a session, App Services continues to use the value as it was at the time of session start.  * On the next session, if the value is different from what it was at the start of this session, App Services causes a client reset.  * You cannot use the %function operator in read and write rules. Functions would not operate on a per-document basis.  * You cannot store permissions information (such as \"which document IDs may this user access?\") in the user object. \nPERMISSION CHANGES \nIf a user's permissions have changed since the last Sync session, Sync triggers a client reset and re-downloads all data with the new permissions applied. A user's permissions might change in the following situations:  * You updated the Data Source configuration to modify the rules.  * Your rules reference custom user data to determine permissions dynamically, and the value of that custom user data has changed since the last Sync session.

Services Assigns Roles\n * Without Device Sync\n * With Device Sync\n * Apply When Expressions\n * Document Filters\n * Role Order\n * Sync Compatibility\n * Define Roles & Permissions \nOVERVIEW \nYou secure your App's data by defining roles that are automatically assigned to incoming user requests and Device Sync sessions. Each role has fine-grained data access permissions and dynamic conditions that determine when the role applies. For examples of how you might configure permissions for common scenarios with Device Sync, see the Device Sync Permissions Guide. If you're using the older Partition-Based Device Sync, rules and roles work differently. To configure Partition-Based Sync permissions, see Partition-Based Sync Permissions. \nWHAT ARE PERMISSIONS? \nA permission is a status that Atlas App Services assigns to individual users to control what they can and cannot do with your app's data. App Services uses both document-level and field-level permissions:      * Document-level permissions control whether a user can insert, delete, modify, and search for a specific document in a MongoDB collection.  * Field-level permissions control whether a user can read or write the data in specific fields of a document. \nDOCUMENT-LEVEL PERMISSIONS \nA role's document-level permissions determine which actions that affect the entire document can be performed. These permissions always apply to the entire document regardless of the content. A role can have the following document-level permissions:  * Insert: You can insert new documents.  * Delete: You can delete existing documents.  * Search: You can search for the document using Atlas Search. \nFIELD-LEVEL PERMISSIONS \nA role's field-level permissions determine whether a user can read or write fields within the document. These permissions only affect the field they apply to, so a user can have read or write access to only a subset of the entire document. You can define field-level permissions for specific fields and default read/write permissions for any additional fields that you don't explicitly define. \nROLES \nA role is a named set of permissions that a user may have for documents in a MongoDB collection. A role has an \"apply when\" expression that determines whether App Services should assign the role to a user. Roles also have a set of document- and field-level permissions that a user has when assigned the role. App Services only commits operations that a user is authorized to do based on their assigned role. If a role does not have permission to read a document or some of its fields, App Services omits the document or fields from the results. \nEXAMPLE Consider a collection named employees where each employee has their own document with all of their employment data. This collection might have two roles: Employee and Manager. We're not using Device Sync, so App Services selects a role on a per-document basis.  * If a user requests their own document, their role is Employee. An employee can read and write their own data but can't create or delete their own documents.  * If a user requests a document for someone whose name is listed in the user's manages arrays, their role is Manager. A manager can read and write their direct reports' data and can create and delete their documents.  * If a user is neither an Employee nor a Manager for a given document, then they have no role and cannot read, write, or search that document.   HOW APP SERVICES ASSIGNS ROLES \nApp Services assigns roles at different times depending on whether you're using Device Sync (Flexible Mode) or not. When using Device Sync, App Services assigns roles at the start of a Sync session for each collection to be synced; otherwise, App Services assigns roles on a per-document basis. A Sync session is the period of time between opening and closing a Sync connection. Whether using Device Sync or not, you can define a set of roles that are specific to collections and default roles that apply to any other unspecified collection. To assign a role, App Services evaluates each role's \"apply when\" expression in the order that you specified them. The first role whose \"apply when\" expression evaluates to true becomes the assigned role. If no role matches, access is denied. \nWITHOUT DEVICE SYNC \nWhen not using Device Sync, App Services dynamically assigns roles for every document. The user is assigned a separate role, or no role, for each document that matches the incoming query.

\nOVERVIEW \nWhen you first create an App, you must select a deployment type that determines where your application's data is stored and processed. You can deploy your App globally or limit the deployment to a specific cloud deployment region. \nDEPLOYMENT MODELS  GLOBAL DEPLOYMENT \nA globally deployed App is hosted across the world in all of the following AWS regions:      * Ireland (IE) - aws-eu-west-1  * Oregon (US-OR) - aws-us-west-2  * Sydney (AU) - aws-ap-southeast-2  * Virginia (US-VA) - aws-us-east-1 An App can handle most types of requests from any region. For example, any region can run serverless functions, evaluate rules, validate object schemas, or authenticate users. All write operations to a linked MongoDB data source are handled within a single region that you specify when you create the App. You can choose any global region to handle writes, but should generally choose the region closest to your MongoDB cluster. If a server in another region needs to handle a write request, it forwards the request to the configured write region, which adds latency to the write operation. Realm SDKs automatically execute application requests, such as reading user information or calling a function, in the global deployment region that's closest to the user that issued the request. Requests sent to a global URL (e.g. with the Data API or GraphQL) are forwarded to the closest server at the DNS level. Requests sent to a region-specific URL execute in that region regardless of the user's location. \nLOCAL DEPLOYMENT \nA locally deployed App is available in a single cloud provider region. All requests and MongoDB write operations are handled exclusively in the region, which you specify when you create the App. You can deploy to any region, but should generally choose the region closest to your application's users. \nCLOUD DEPLOYMENT REGIONS \nYou can deploy your App to cloud regions hosted around the world by the major cloud providers. Support for a given region depends on your deployment model. Global deployment has fewer supported regions than local deployment.

You can:      * Configure TLS to secure network requests to and from your application.  * Define IP addresses from which all outbound requests originate.  * Define and manage URLs and IP addresses from which inbound requests may originate. \nTRANSPORT LAYER SECURITY (TLS) \nApp Services uses TLS 1.3 to secure all network requests to and from your application, including:  * Apps that connect from a Realm SDK.  * Data API and GraphQL requests sent over HTTPS.  * Queries and operations on a linked MongoDB Atlas data source. The TLS certificate is pre-defined and cannot be customized or disabled. \nFIREWALL CONFIGURATION \nApp Services only sends outbound requests from a set list of IP addresses. The exact list depends on the cloud provider that the app server is deployed to. You can copy the IP addresses listed in this section to an allowlist for incoming requests on your firewall. You can download a computer-friendly list of all IP addresses used by App Services in JSON or CSV format. You can also find cloud-provider-specific JSON and CSV files in the following sections. \nNOTE If you run a function from the Atlas App Services UI, the request originates from the server nearest to

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nDEPLOY AUTOMATICALLY WITH GITHUB \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Prerequisites\n * Enable Automatic Deployment with GitHub\n * Install the Atlas App Services GitHub App\n * Specify a GitHub Repository\n * Initialize the Repository\n * Enable Automatic Deployment\n * Make Changes to Your Application\n * Commit and Push Your Changes\n * Make Changes from the UI\n * Avoid Making Changes from the CLI\n * Summary \nOVERVIEW \nYou can configure an Atlas App Services App to automatically deploy whenever you push App configuration files to a GitHub repository. You can clone the GitHub repository to your computer and then use standard Git commands to pull down the latest versions and deploy new changes. \nPREREQUISITES \n     * A GitHub account and repository. The repository should either be empty or contain an exported configuration directory for an existing App. For information on how to create an empty repository, see GitHub's create a repo guide.  * An installed copy of the Git CLI. If you do not have git installed, see the official guide for Installing Git.  * A MongoDB Atlas Programmatic API Key to authenticate and authorize access to your app's underlying Git repo. If you have not yet generated a programmatic API key for your Atlas organization, do so now. \nENABLE AUTOMATIC DEPLOYMENT WITH GITHUB \n1 \nINSTALL THE ATLAS APP SERVICES GITHUB APP \nIn order to automatically deploy based on a GitHub repository, Atlas App Services requires that you install a GitHub app that has, at minimum, read access to the repository. To install the app, click Deployment in the left navigation menu of the App Services UI. Select the Configuration tab and then click Install App Services on GitHub. A new browser window will open to the GitHub application installation flow. \nNOTE \nGITHUB AUTHENTICATION GitHub may require you to provide your GitHub account credentials before you can install the app. Select the GitHub account or organization for which you want to install the app:  Specify one or more repositories for which you want to grant App Services read access. You can either select specific repositories or grant access to all of your repositories on GitHub. Select the repositories you want to use and then click Install.  After you install the application, click Authorize to finish connecting App Services to GitHub. This leads you to a github permissions screen, where you will click Authorize App Services.  \nNOTE \nGITHUB PERMISSIONS You can manage permissions for the App Services GitHub application from the Installed GitHub Apps page in your GitHub settings. 2 \nSPECIFY A GITHUB REPOSITORY \nOnce you have linked your GitHub account to your App, you can specify a repository that App Services should automatically deploy. Specify the Repository, Branch, and Directory that contain the App's configuration files and then click Save.  \nNOTE The list of repositories will only contain repos that you have granted App Services read access to. 3 \nINITIALIZE THE REPOSITORY \nClone a local copy of the Git repository that you specified: git clone https://github.com/<organization>/<repo>.git  The configured branch and directory must contain configuration files that define your application. You can create the configuration manually or export the application directory of an existing app. Add the application directory to the repository and then commit the changes: git add -Agit commit -m \"Adds App Services Application Directory\"  Once you have committed the latest version of the application to the repository, push it to your GitHub repository: git push origin <branch name> \n4 \nENABLE AUTOMATIC DEPLOYMENT \nAfter you have specified a repository to deploy and initialized it with the latest version of your app, you need to enable automatic deployment to begin deploying it. On the Configuration tab of the Deploy page, click Enable Automatic Deployment. In the modal that appears, click Enable Automatic Deployment to confirm your selection. \n5 \nMAKE CHANGES TO YOUR APPLICATION \nA deployment contains one or more changes that you have made to your application since the previous deployment. Make any additions, modifications, or deletions to the repository that you want to include in your deployment. Refer to the App Configuration reference page and individual component reference pages for details on the structure and schema of your application directory. \nIMPORTANT \nDO NOT MAKE BREAKING SCHEMA CHANGES VIA AUTOMATED DEPLOY Because breaking - also called destructive - schema changes require special handling, App Services does not support making breaking schema changes via automated deploy with GitHub.

deployment pipelines to automatically test and publish their applications whenever they make changes. This is most common and useful for larger apps where multiple people work on the codebase in parallel using a shared version control system like git. This guide covers the high level stages common to most CI/CD pipelines and describes what you might do in each stage. Further, it includes a list of common tasks and actions you might perform within your pipelines to configure and test your Atlas App Services Apps. \nTIP \nSEE A REAL EXAMPLE WITH GITHUB ACTIONS If you'd like to see an example CI/CD pipeline that manages testing, deployment, and other tasks for a real application, check out the article How to Build CI/CD Pipelines for App Services Apps Using GitHub Actions on the MongoDB Developer Hub. \nPIPELINE STAGES \nAt a high level most pipelines share a common pattern of moving through multiple stages that each handle different concerns. \nDEVELOPMENT \nThe Development stage is the first step for creating new features and fixing bugs in an App. In this stage you work with your application's configuration files and source code to implement your desired changes. To develop new features for an existing app:       1. Fork the main app and deploy a new development copy. This instance will have a different App ID than your production app. You can also use environment value templates to use development data sources and other services that are not linked to production.  2. Develop your application. This could involve updating or adding a client app screen, adding a new database trigger, or any other application features. You can use Development Mode if you need to make changes to your synced Realm Object Schema.  1. Run automated tests locally to ensure that your code does not introduce any new errors. Tests that pass locally do not guarantee that your app is free of integration bugs, but increase confidence that your changes do not include any regressions or unintended behavior. \nSTAGING \nThe Staging stage, which you might also call QA (Quality Assurance), Testing, or Pre-Production, is a step that simulates your development changes in an environment that is as similar to production as possible. This gives you a usable version of your app for review and can help you catch integration bugs with live services without affecting production data. The specifics of your staging deployment depend on your application's needs. However, you can use the following high level procedure to set it up:  1. Set up your staging environment. Use separate, non-production services and data sources with configurations that mirror production as closely as possible. For example, you might use an Atlas cluster named staging that otherwise has the same configuration as your production cluster. Depending on your use case, you may have a consistent App that you reuse for all staging builds or you may create a new App for each staging build.  2. Create or use an existing staging build. You can automatically create a staging build as part of your CI/CD process, such as when you create a new new pull request. You can use a new app for each staging build or you can reuse a prebuilt environment that you share across builds.  3. Verify that your app behaves as expected. This might involve running an automated test suite against your staging environment, manually checking behavior, or getting approval through a user-acceptance test. \nPRODUCTION \nThe Production stage is the final deployment step where your modified app is deployed into your production environment. Ideally at this stage you have already tested your changes locally and in staging to confirm that they are safe to deploy. You can either deploy to production manually or automatically as part of your CI/CD workflow by updating your production app. \nBUILD TASKS \nThis section outlines common tasks that you will perform in your CI/CD pipeline. You may not always do all of these tasks depending on your use case and pipeline stage, but in general most pipelines will perform all of these at least once. \nCONFIGURE THE ENVIRONMENT \nThe configuration and code for your app should generally be similar between development stages. However, you'll want to change the value of certain configuration options depending on the environment. Determine what stage you're building and set the appropriate configuration values.

 \nTIP \nFIND YOUR APP ID You might not always be able to hardcode your App ID. You can look up a specific App ID with Realm CLI. For an example, see Create an App. \nSET UP REALM CLI \nRealm CLI is the easiest way to programmatically create, configure, and manage App Services Apps. You should install and use the latest version in your deployment scripts. npm install -g mongodb-realm-cli  You'll also need a MongoDB Atlas public/private API key pair to authenticate and use the CLI. For more information and a walkthrough of how to get an API key, see Programmatic API Keys. To log in, save your API keys in a new named profile configuration and then log in with that profile: ~/.config/realm-cli/<Profile Name>.yaml <Profile Name>:  public_api_key: \"<MongoDB Atlas Public API Key>\"  private_api_key: \"<MongoDB Atlas Private API Key>\"  atlas_base_url: \"https://cloud.mongodb.com\"  realm_base_url: \"https://realm.mongodb.com\"  telemetry_mode: \"\"  realm-cli login --profile=\"<Profile Name>\"  \nTIP Make sure to use the --profile flag in all of your commands, otherwise Realm CLI won't recognize that you're logged in. \nCREATE AN APP \nYou can use Realm CLI to create new apps to use in development and testing. If your pipeline is in the Development or Staging phase, you should deploy and test changes with an app other than your live production app. To use a new app for your development or staging branch:  1. Create a New App\n    \n    Push a new app based on your branch of the app's configuration files:\n    \n    cd path/to/realmApprealm-cli push -y --project=\"<MongoDB Atlas Project ID>\" # e.g. --project=\"609ea544934fe445460219a2\"\n    \n      2. Save the App ID\n    \n    The new app has a unique App ID value that you'll need to identify it later in your pipeline and in your client app. You should save the value to an environment variable, file, or other location.\n    \n    # Save to an environment variableoutput=$(realm-cli app describe)app_id=$(echo $output | sed 's/^.*client_app_id\": \"\\([^\"]*\\).*/\\1/')export REALM_APP_ID=app_id# Save to a fileecho $REALM_APP_ID > ./clients/ios/realm-app-id.txt\n    \n     \nUPDATE AN APP \nYou can use Realm CLI to update an existing app, like a shared staging app or your production deployment. The app already exists, so you should be able to look up its App ID. To update an existing app, specify its App ID in the --remote flag: realm-cli push --remote=$REALM_APP_ID -y  \nRUN TESTS AGAINST THE APP \nYour app should include automated unit and integration test suites that you can run to verify that everything works. The specifics of your test setup will vary depending upon your app, but you may need to run tests across multiple platforms using a variety of simulators. If you have integration tests, you could checkout previous releases and run your integration tests against the current version of the App to ensure backwards compatibility. \nCLEAN UP THE JOB \nAt the end of a CI/CD stage or pipeline you may want to clean up resources that you created specifically for that test. For example, if you create a new Development or Staging app, you might delete the apps and any databases associated with them once your changes are merged. Alternatively, you would not want to clean up your production app or a persistent staging app if you use one. Before you clean up, consider what resources may be useful in future. For example, you could choose to skip deleting apps and their databases if your tests fail.

Relationships allow you to reference and query related documents in read and write operations, even if the documents are in separate databases or collections. You define a relationship for a \"source\" MongoDB collection and link to documents in a \"foreign\" collection. Atlas App Services automatically resolves relationships in synced SDK data models and GraphQL operations by replacing the values in a source field with the foreign documents that they reference. \nIMPORTANT \nRELATIONSHIPS CANNOT SPAN PARTITIONS In an app that uses Partition-Based Sync, an object can only have a relationship with other objects in the same partition. The objects can exist in different databases and collections (within the same cluster) as long as the partition key value matches. To understand how partitions can span multiple databases and collections, see Partition-Based Sync. Relationships are unidirectional and don't enforce uniqueness or other foreign key constraints. If you reference a non-existent foreign value in a source field, App Services automatically omits the reference from resolved relationships. \nEXAMPLE Consider an application that has two collections:      * The accounts collection contains documents that each describe a customer account.\n   \n   Account Collection Schema\n   \n   {  \"title\": \"Account\",  \"properties\": {    \"_id\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" },    \"account_id\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },    \"products\": {      \"bsonType\": \"array\",      \"items\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" }    },    ...  }}\n   \n     * The customers collection contains documents that each describe a single customer that can have one or more accounts. Every document in the customers collection has an accounts field that contains an array of every account_id value from the accounts collection that applies to the customer.\n   \n   Customer Collection Schema\n   \n   {  \"title\": \"Customer\",  \"properties\": {    \"username\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },    \"accounts\": {      \"bsonType\": \"array\",      \"items\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" }    },    ...  }}\n   \n    The app defines this relationship on the customers collection. It points from the array of account id values stored in the accounts field to the account_id field of each document in the accounts collection. {  \"accounts\": {    \"ref\": \"#/realm/mongodb-atlas/sample_analytics/accounts\",    \"foreign_key\": \"account_id\",    \"is_list\": true  }}  With this relationship defined, App Services can return a customer and all of their accounts in the same GraphQL query. Without a relationship, the query would return a list of just account_id values instead of the full Account objects. query CustomerAccounts {  customer(query: { username: \"Elizabeth Ray\" }) {    username    accounts {      account_id      products    }  }}  \nCARDINALITY \nA relationship's cardinality determines the number of foreign documents that it can reference. App Services supports two relationship cardinalities: \"to-one\" and \"to-many\". \nTO-ONE \nA to-one relationship links each source document with either a single document or an array of documents from the foreign collection. To indicate that a relationship has \"to-one\" cardinality, set is_list to false: data_sources/mongodb-atlas/example/pets/relationships.json {  \"owner\": {    \"ref\":

  TO-MANY \nA to-many relationship links each source document with a list of documents from the foreign collection.

Use dot notation to access properties in embedded objects. \nEMBEDDED OBJECT TO ANOTHER COLLECTION \nAn embedded object can have a relationship with an object in a foreign collection. {  \"title\": \"Person\",  \"properties\": {    \"_id\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" },    \"pet\": {      \"bsonType\":\"object\",      \"properties\": {        \"favoriteToyBrand\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" }      }    }    // ...additional model properties  }}  Use dot notation to specify the embedded object property that has a relationship with the foreign collection. Then, you can specify the foreign collection details and foreign key field. { \"pet.favoriteToyBrand\":   {      \"ref\": \"#/relationship/mongodb-atlas/example/ToyBrand\",      \"foreign_key\": \"_id\",      \"is_list\": false }}  \nEMBEDDED OBJECT WITHIN A LIST \nAn embedded object that is within a list property can have a relationship with a foreign collection. \nIMPORTANT The GraphQL API does not currently support embedded object relationships. You can resolve embedded object relationships with Atlas Device Sync and in the Realm SDKs. {  \"title\": \"Person\",  \"properties\": {    \"_id\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" },    \"pets\": {      \"bsonType\":\"array\",      \"items\": {        \"bsonType\": \"object\",        \"properties\": {          \"favoriteToyBrand\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" }        }      }    }   // ...additional model properties  }}  To access a embedded object property contained in a list, use: field1.[].field2, e.g. pets.[].favoriteToyBrand. From there, you can specify the foreign collection details and foreign key field. \nTIP \nUSE THE SAME SYNTAX WITH DICTIONARIES AND SETS You can use this same field1.[].field2 syntax when creating relationships within dictionaries and sets. {  \"pets.[].favoriteToyBrand\": {    \"ref\": \"#/relationship/mongodb-atlas/example/ToyBrand\",    \"foreign_key\": \"_id\",    \"is_list\": false  }}  \nNOTE \nPRIMITIVES VERSUS LISTS, DICTIONARIES, AND SETS IN RELATIONSHIPS In the example above, is_list is set to false. The field at the end of the relationship string here is a primitive, not a list. The embedded object is contained in a list, but the favoriteToyBrand property itself is not a dictionary, set or list. \nDEFINE A RELATIONSHIP \nWhen you define a relationship, keep these limitations in mind:  * The reference field must not be _id  * The reference field must not be a required field  * The foreign key must be the _id field of the collection the field is referencing \n1. DEFINE SCHEMAS \nIn order to define a relationship, you must have a schema defined for both the source collection and the foreign collection. To learn how to define schemas, see Enforce a Schema. \n2. CREATE A NEW RELATIONSHIP \nYou define a relationship for collections in a linked MongoDB data source alongside the schema.   3.

Rules\n * Static Hosting\n * Sync - Concurrent Workloads \nOVERVIEW \nAtlas App Services has several guidelines to keep in mind when architecting how your tools and clients interact with MongoDB through App Services. Keep this guidance in mind when deciding how to structure queries, selecting which CRUD and aggregation operations to use, and determining how to handle concurrent workloads. \nAGGREGATION \nApp Services supports all aggregation pipeline stages in system functions except for $currentOp and $indexStats. For security reasons, only a subset of aggregation pipeline stages are supported in user functions. For a list of pipeline stages that are available and their allowed function context, see Aggregation. \nATLAS  BATCH LOADING \nWhen data is bulk/batch loaded into MongoDB Atlas, you may see a delay in data appearing on devices while App Services processes changes. \nFEDERATED DATABASE INSTANCES \nYou can link a Federated database instance to your app as a MongoDB data source. However, there are some caveats to keep in mind when working with Atlas Data Federation:      * Federated data sources do not support write operations.  * You can only access a Federated data source from a system function.  * You cannot connect to a Federated data source via the wire protocol.  * You cannot define roles and permissions for a Federated data source.  * You cannot set a read preference for a Federated data source.  * You cannot create a database trigger on a Federated data source.  * You cannot use a Federated data source as your app's Device Sync cluster. \nSERVERLESS INSTANCES \nYou can link a serverless instance to your app as a MongoDB data source. However, serverless instances do not currently support change streams, so the following features are limited:  * You cannot create a database trigger on a serverless instance.  * You cannot use a serverless instance as your app's Device Sync cluster.  * You cannot watch collections for changes data sources that are serverless MongoDB Atlas instances. \nSHARDED CLUSTERS \nAtlas Device Sync does not currently support sharded MongoDB Atlas clusters. However, you can add a sharded cluster as a data source and access it from a function. \nTIME SERIES COLLECTIONS \nTime series collections do not yet support change streams. Therefore, you cannot define triggers on a time series collection. You can use time series collections with Atlas Device Sync, but only Asymmetric Sync is supported. \nPRIVATE ENDPOINTS \nApp Services does not currently support private endpoints. \nCHANGE STREAMS \nApp Services limits the total number of change streams open against a given cluster across all Apps based on the cluster's size. The following table lists the limitations for each cluster size: Cluster Size\nMaximum Number of Change Streams\nFree Tier (M0)\n5\nShared Clusters (M2/M5)\n10\nSmall, Dedicated Clusters (M10/M20)\n100\nStandard Clusters (M30/M40)\n1000\nStandard Clusters (M50 - M90)\n2500\nHigh-Power Clusters (M100+)\n2500 \nNOTE App Services opens a single change stream on each collection that is associated with a Database Trigger, Device Sync, or watch() operation. \nIMPORTANT \nUSAGE RECOMMENDATION To minimize the number of open change streams:  * Start Watch and Sync operations only when necessary. Close any open Watch and Sync streams immediately when they're no longer necessary.  * Avoid data models that require you to Watch or Sync an unbounded number of collections. \nDATABASE COMMANDS \nApp Services does not support any database commands in the Client SDKs or Functions. You can, however, call a limited subset of database commands when when connected to a MongoDB cluster over the wire protocol. For a list of supported commands, see Database Commands. \nMONGODB VERSION REQUIREMENTS \nYou can access most of the CRUD and Aggregation functionality of MongoDB version 3.6 with the MongoDB service; however, App Services does not support all operations and features available in standard tools and clients.

Binary Data\n * Realm Database Types\n * Set\n * Dictionary\n * Dictionary of a BSON Type\n * Dictionary of Mixed BSON Types\n * Dictionary of Embedded Objects \nALL SCHEMA TYPES \nThe following fields are available for all BSON schemas regardless of type: {  \"bsonType\": \"<BSON Type>\" | [\"<BSON Type>\", ...],  \"type\": \"<JSON Type>\" | [\"<JSON Type>\", ...],  \"enum\": [<Value 1>, <Value 2>, ...],  \"description\": \"<Descriptive Text>,  \"title\": \"<Short Description>\"} \nField Name\nDescription\nbsonType The BSON type of the property the schema describes. If the property's value can be of multiple types, specify an array of BSON types. Cannot be used with the type field. BSON types include all JSON types as well as additional types that you can reference by name:      * double  * string  * object  * array  * objectId  * date  * bool  * null  * regex  * int  * timestamp  * long  * decimal  * uuid  * binData  * mixed type The JSON type of the property the schema describes. If the property's value can be of multiple types, specify an array of JSON types. Cannot be used with bsonType. \nIMPORTANT Atlas App Services supports the type field to maintain compatibility with the JSON schema standard. However, we recommend that you use the bsonType field instead. BSON types include all JSON schema types and support even more data types. The following standard JSON types are available:  * object  * array  * number  * boolean  * string  * null \nNOTE MongoDB's JSON Schema implementation does not support the integer JSON type. Instead, use the bsonType field with int or long as the value. enum\nAn array that includes all valid values for the data that the schema describes.\ntitle\nA short title or name for the data that the schema models. This field is used for metadata purposes only and has no impact on schema validation.\ndescription\nA detailed description of the data that the schema models. This field is used for metadata purposes only and has no impact on schema validation. \nBSON TYPES  ARRAY \nAn array contains multiple values of a specific type. BSON array schemas use the standard JSON Schema array format. {  \"bsonType\": \"array\",  \"items\": <Schema Document> | [<Schema Document>, ...],  \"additionalItems\": <boolean> | <Schema Document>,  \"maxItems\": <integer>,  \"minItems\": <integer>,  \"uniqueItems\": <boolean>} \nField Name\nDescription\nitems\nA schema for all array items, or an array of schemas where order matters.\nadditionalItems Default: true. If true, the array may contain additional values that are not defined in the schema. If false, only values that are explicitly listed in the items array may appear in the array. If the value is a schema object, any additional fields must validate against the schema. \nNOTE The additionalItems field only affects array schemas that have an array-valued items field. If the items field is a single schema object, additionalItems has no effect. maxItems\nThe maximum length of the array.\nminItems\nThe minimum length of the array.\nuniqueItems Default: false If true, each item in the array must be unique. If false, multiple array items may be identical. \nTIP \nUNIQUE ARRAYS ARE SETS To model a Set, use the array schema type with uniqueItems set to true. \nBOOLEAN \nA bool is either true or false. { \"bsonType\": \"bool\" }  \nMIXED \nA mixed field may contain any schema type except for arrays, embedded objects, sets, and dictionaries. App Services does not enforce a consistent type across documents, so two different documents may have values of different types. Mixed fields can represent relationships. Sync translates these relationships to MongoDB as a DBRef to preserve the database name, collection name, and primary key of the link. { \"bsonType\": \"mixed\" }  \nNUMBER \nA number generically configures some type of number.

If the value is a schema object, any additional fields must validate against the schema. dependencies\nSpecify property and schema dependencies. \nNOTE \nMODEL DICTIONARIES WITH THE OBJECT SCHEMA TYPE To model dictionaries, use the object schema type with additionalProperties set to the object type of the values stored in the dictionary. \nOBJECTID \nAn objectId is a 12-byte identifier for BSON objects. ObjectId values are most commonly used as the unique _id values of documents in a MongoDB collection or objects in a synced realm. { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" }  \nSTRING \nA string is text encoded as a series of characters. BSON string schemas use the standard JSON Schema string format. {  \"bsonType\": \"string\",  \"maxLength\": <integer>,  \"minLength\": <integer>,  \"pattern\": \"<Regular Expression>\"} \nField Name\nDescription\nmaxLength\nThe maximum number of characters in the string.\nminLength\nThe minimum number of characters in the string.\npattern\nA regular expression string that must match the string value. \nUUID \nA uuid (Universal Unique Identifier) is a standardized 16-byte unique object identifier. { \"bsonType\": \"uuid\" }  \nBINARY DATA \nA binData is a piece of unstructured binary data. Maps to the binary BSON type. Always uses subtype 0. { \"bsonType\": \"binData\" }  \nREALM DATABASE TYPES  SET \nA set is a collection of unique values. A set schema is an array schema where uniqueItems is set to true. {   \"bsonType\": \"array\",   \"uniqueItems\": true,   \"items\": {      \"bsonType\": \"long\"   }}  \nDICTIONARY \nA dictionary is a collection of dynamic and unique string keys paired with values of a given type. A dictionary is functionally an object or document without pre-defined field names. A dictionary schema is an object schema where properties is not defined and the value of additionalProperties is a schema for the dictionary value's type.

Notifications\n * Rule Templates\n * Notifications Must Have a Specific Title\n * Notifications Must Be for a Specific Topic\n * Notifications Can Only Be Sent To a Limited Set of User IDs\n * Push Notification Rules\n * Notification Document Fields \nIMPORTANT \nTHIRD PARTY SERVICES & PUSH NOTIFICATIONS DEPRECATION Third party services and push notifications in App Services have been deprecated in favor of creating HTTP endpoints that use external dependencies in functions. Webhooks have been renamed to HTTPS Endpoints with no change in behavior. You should migrate existing Webhooks. Existing services will continue to work until 1 Aug 2023. Because third party services and push notifications are now deprecated, they have been removed by default from the App Services UI. If you need to manage an existing third party service or push notification, you can add the configurations back to the UI by doing the following:      * In the left navigation, under the Manage section, click App Settings.  * Enable the toggle switch next to Temporarily Re-Enable 3rd Party Services, and then save your changes. \nOVERVIEW \nAtlas App Services supports integrating mobile (Android and iOS) apps with the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) service to provide push notifications. You configure and send notification messages from within the App Services console, while clients register with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for messages sent to specific topics. \nMANAGEMENT INTERFACE \nThe Push Notifications screen in the App Services UI lets you write notification drafts, send notifications to users, and define notification rules. There are four tabs in the Push Notifications screen: Tab Name\nDescription\nDraft In the Draft tab, you can view a list of the draft messages. For the draft messages, you can:  * Duplicate draft messages  * Edit draft messages  * Delete draft messages Sent The Sent tab shows the messages that App Services has already sent to registered clients. From here, you can view a list of the sent messages. For the sent messages, you can:  * Resend sent messages.  * Duplicate sent messages. Config\nIn the Config tab, you provide the FCM credentials (Sender ID and Legacy API key).\nRules\nYou can optionally specify Push Notification Rules to restrict the types of push notifications that your application sends. \nSEND A PUSH NOTIFICATION \nYou can send new Push Notifications from the Push Notifications page. Click the Send New Notification button to open the Send New Notification dialog.

Accepts the list of User IDs provided in the userIds argument  2. Queries MongoDB for a user document that matches the current user's id  3. Compares the provided phone number to the number listed in the user document  4. Returns the boolean result of the comparison exports = function(toPhone) {  const mdb = context.services.get('mongodb-atlas');  const users = mdb.db('demo').collection('users');  const user = users.findOne({ _id: context.user.id });  return user.phoneNumber === toPhone;}  \nPUSH NOTIFICATION RULES \nTo specify rules for Push Notifications, click on the Rules tab on the Push Notifications page. \nNOTE Unlike other services in App Services, rules for push notifications are optional.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nAPP SERVICES METRICS REFERENCE \nOn this page    \n * Metric Format\n   \n * Units\n * Available Metrics App Services provides a variety of metrics related to App Services and Device Sync. You can access your metrics data with the Admin API's Retrieve App Services metrics endpoint. The exact metrics returned may be subject to change. \nMETRIC FORMAT \nWhen you request metrics, you specify a start time, end time, and time granularity such as \"hourly\". The response contains a list of measurement objects, one for each metric listed below. Each measurement object contains a list of data points that represent that metric's value at a specific time. For example, you request hourly metrics from 12:00am to 11:59pm Tuesday. App Services sends back a list of measurements. Each measurement contains about 24 data points (one for each hour between start and end time). The value field of each data point is the value of that metric at the time specified by the timestamp. \nUNITS \nApp Services expresses each metric in one of the following units:      * BYTES_PER_SECOND  * MILLISECONDS  * SCALAR  * SCALAR_PER_SECOND A scalar is a singular value representing a magnitude or count. Its exact interpretation depends on the metric. A scalar per second represents a count over time (\"rate\"). The value is effectively the total count since the previous data point divided by the number of seconds since the previous data point.

Rules [Deprecated]\n * Incoming Webhooks [Deprecated]\n * Guides\n * Built-In Services\n * Reference Documentation \nIMPORTANT \nTHIRD PARTY SERVICES & PUSH NOTIFICATIONS DEPRECATION Third party services and push notifications in App Services have been deprecated in favor of creating HTTP endpoints that use external dependencies in functions. Webhooks have been renamed to HTTPS Endpoints with no change in behavior. You should migrate existing Webhooks. Existing services will continue to work until 1 Aug 2023. Because third party services and push notifications are now deprecated, they have been removed by default from the App Services UI. If you need to manage an existing third party service or push notification, you can add the configurations back to the UI by doing the following:      * In the left navigation, under the Manage section, click App Settings.  * Enable the toggle switch next to Temporarily Re-Enable 3rd Party Services, and then save your changes. \nINTRODUCTION \nModern applications often use multiple external services to handle complex use cases, such as messaging, analytics, and data management. You can connect to these services through Atlas App Services by creating and configuring service interfaces. Service interfaces specify the connection details for a specific external service and enable you to define the scope of that service's capabilities with custom service rules. Once you've configured an interface for a service, you can instantiate a service client that connects to the interface and exposes the service's actions as methods. You can also create incoming webhooks that enable external services to communicate directly with your App over HTTP. \nNOTE \nBUILT-IN SERVICE CLIENTS App Services includes clients for certain external services, such as Twilio and AWS. You can also use the HTTP service to create a custom interface for any external service that offers a REST API. \nCONCEPTS  SERVICE CLIENTS [DEPRECATED] \nA service client is an object that connects to a service interface and enables you to call actions associated with the service. You can instantiate service clients in functions (using function context) as well as in your client application code. For details on instantiating and using service clients, see Call a Service Action. \nSERVICE ACTIONS [DEPRECATED] \nA service action is a method that handles a specific use case for a particular service, such as sending a text message with Twilio or putting an object to an AWS S3 bucket. Actions encapsulate implementation details like request authentication and HTTP methods behind semantic methods that are specific to each service. When you call a service action, App Services evaluates each service rule that applies to the action and prevents execution unless one of the rules evaluates to true. \nIMPORTANT App Services blocks all service actions by default. You must configure a service rule that enables a particular action before you can call it. \nSERVICE RULES [DEPRECATED] \nA service rule is an expression that App Services evaluates to determine whether or not a user can execute one or more actions in a service. For example, you could create a Twilio rule that only lets users send a text message from a specific phone number or an AWS rule that prevents users from putting objects to an S3 bucket that is not included in a list of approved buckets. \nNOTE \nEXPRESSION VARIABLES Expression variables are variables that you can include in service rules to represent dynamic information about your application and an action's execution. You can configure service rules based on the authenticated user that called an action (%%user) and the arguments that they provided (%%args). You can also create complex rules that call a Function (%function) and evaluate based on the Function's return value. \nINCOMING WEBHOOKS [DEPRECATED] \nAn incoming webhook is a custom handler for events that originate from an external service, such as when someone opens a new pull request on GitHub or sends a text message to a Twilio phone number. Get started with incoming webhooks by configuring a service webhook. Incoming webhooks consist of two primary components: the webhook URL and the webhook Function. Component\nDescription\nWebhook URL A URL that uniquely identifies the incoming webhook. External services can interact with the webhook by sending an HTTP request that matches the webhook's configuration to the webhook URL.

Each component has a specific configuration file schema and every application uses a standard file structure to organize the configuration files. \nWHEN WILL I USE CONFIGURATION FILES? \nEvery App is composed of a collection of configuration files, so you use application configuration files whenever you create or modify an App. If you use the App Services UI then you rarely deal directly with the configuration files themselves, but other deployment methods, like Realm CLI and GitHub allow you to define and edit the configuration files directly. \nDIRECTORY STRUCTURE \nThe following figure shows a high-level view of an App's directory structure: yourRealmApp/├── config.json├── secrets.json├── auth_providers/│   └── <provider name>.json├── functions/│   └── <function name>/│       ├── config.json│       └── source.js├── services/│   └── <service name>/│       ├── config.json│       ├── incoming_webhooks/│       │   ├── config.json│       │   └── source.js│       └── rules/│           └── <rule name>.json├── triggers/│   └── <trigger name>.json├── hosting/│   ├── metadata.json│   └── files/│       └── <files to host>└── values/    └── <value name>.json  \nAPPLICATION CONFIGURATION \nApplication-level configuration information is defined in a single document named config.json stored in your application's root directory. yourRealmApp/└── config.json \nCONFIGURATION \nconfig.json {  \"app_id\": \"\",  \"name\": \"\",  \"security\": {    \"allowed_request_origins\": [\"<Origin URL>\"]  },  \"hosting\": {    \"enabled\": <boolean>,    \"custom_domain\": \"<Custom Domain Name>\",    \"app_default_domain\": \"<Default Domain Name>\"  },  \"custom_user_data_config\": {    \"enabled\": <Boolean>    \"mongo_service_id\": \"<MongoDB Service ID>\",    \"database_name\": \"<Database Name>\",    \"collection_name\": \"<Collection Name>\",    \"user_id_field\": \"<Field Name>\"  }  \"deployment_model\": \"<Deployment Model Type>\",  \"location\": \"<Deployment Cloud Region Name>\",  \"config_version\": <Version Number>} \nField\nDescription\napp_id\nString\nThe application's App ID.\nname\nString The application's name. \nNOTE \nAPP NAME LIMITATIONS Application names must be between 1 and 32 characters and may only contain ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. security\nDocument A document that contains configuration options for application-level security features. \"security\": {  \"allowed_request_origins\": [\"<Origin URL>\"]} Field Name\nDescription\nallowed_request_origins\nArray<String> An array of URLs that incoming requests may originate from.

If the data source is not a synced cluster or Federated database instance, then you can define collection-level rules in the /rules sub-directory. yourRealmApp/└── services/    └── <MongoDB Service Name>/        ├── config.json        └── rules/            └── <rule name>.json \nIMPORTANT MongoDB Service names are not necessarily the same as their linked data source's name in Atlas. You define the service name for a data source when you link it to your application. For linked clusters, the default MongoDB service name is mongodb-atlas. For Federated data sources, the default service name is mongodb-datafederation. \nSERVICE CONFIGURATION \nThe configuration file to link an Atlas cluster should have the following form: config.json {  \"id\": \"<Service ID>\",  \"name\": \"<Service Name>\",  \"type\": \"mongodb-atlas\",  \"config\": {    \"clusterName\": \"<Atlas Cluster Name>\",    \"readPreference\": \"<Read Preference>\",    \"wireProtocolEnabled\": <Boolean>,    \"sync\": <Sync Configuration>  }}  The configuration file for a Federated data source should have the following form: config.json {  \"id\": \"<Service ID>\",  \"name\": \"<Service Name>\",  \"type\": \"datalake\",  \"config\": {     \"dataLakeName\": \"<Federated database instance name>\"   } }  Exactly one of config.dataLakeName and config.clusterName is

Each object type maps to its own collection in the database with a schema that matches the synced objects. sync.partition.key\nString\nThe name of the partition key field that maps data into individual synced realms.\nsync.partition.type\nString\nThe type of the partition key field value.\nsync.partition.permissions\nDocument\nA document that defines the read and write permissions for the synced cluster. Permissions are defined with rule expressions that App Services evaluates per-user, per-partition. The expressions have access to the %%user and %%partition expansions. \nMONGODB COLLECTION RULES (NON-SYNC) \nFor non-synced clusters, you can define collection-level rules that App Services evaluates dynamically for each request. Each collection's rules are stored in a rules.json file in that collection's configuration subdirectory, which is data_sources/<data-source-name>/<database-name>/<collection-name>/. \nNOTE Federated data sources do not support rules or schemas. You can only access a Federated data source from a system function. <database.collection>.json {  \"id\": \"<Rule ID>\",  \"database\": \"<Database Name>\",  \"collection\": \"<Collection Name>\",  \"roles\": [<Role>],  \"schema\": <Document Schema>,  \"filters\": [<Filter>],} \nField\nDescription\nid\nString\nA string that uniquely identifies the trigger. App Services automatically generates a unique ID for a trigger when you create it.\ndatabase\nString\nThe name of the database that holds the collection.\ncollection\nString\nThe name of the

\nField\nDescription\nname\nstring\nThe name of the role. Role names identify and distinguish between roles in the same collection. Limited to 100 characters or fewer.\napply_when\nExpression An expression that evaluates to true when this role applies to a user. When Device Sync (Flexible Mode) is not enabled, App Services assigns a role on a per-document basis. When Device Sync (Flexible Mode) is enabled, App Services assigns roles on a per-collection, per-session basis -- that is, for each synced collection when a client opens a sync connection. To assign a role, App Services evaluates the apply_when of each potential role until one evaluates to true. Potential roles are any roles specified in the rules.json configuration file for the given collection or, if no rules.json file is found for the given collection, the default role(s). App Services evaluates roles in the order that you specify them in your configuration. If no role matches, then access is denied. For more information, see Role-based Permissions. If Device Sync (Flexible Mode) is enabled, the assigned roles must be Sync compatible. If the role is not Sync compatible, but its apply_when evaluated to true, others roles are not considered; access is denied. document_filters\nDocument\nDefault: undefined A document with read and write expressions that determine whether the role's other permissions may be evaluated. If Device Sync is enabled, both document_filters.read and document_filters.write must be defined to make the role Sync compatible. Sync incompatible roles deny all access to Sync requests. If Device Sync is not enabled, document_filters, document_filters.read, and document_filters.write are all optional; an undefined document_filters.read or document_filters.write defaults to true, allowing subsequent permissions to be evaluated. \"document_filters\": {  \"read\": { Expression },  \"write\": { Expression }} \ndocument_filters.read\nExpression\nDefault: undefined An expression that specifies whether read, read permissions in fields, and read permissions in additional_fields may be evaluated. If false (and document_filters.write is undefined or false), read access is denied for the entire document. To maintain Sync compatibility, the expression must be defined and may only reference queryable fields. document_filters.write\nExpression\nDefault: undefined An expression that specifies whether write, write permissions in fields, and write permissions in additional_fields may be evaluated. If false, then write access is denied for the entire document. To maintain Sync compatibility, the expression must be defined and may only reference queryable fields. read\nExpression\nDefault: undefined An expression that evaluates to true if the role has permission to read all fields in the document. To maintain Sync compatibility, the expression must be a boolean literal (either true or false). Document-level read permissions take priority over any field-level permissions. If a role has document-level read permissions, it applies to all fields in the document. Read permissions specified by fields or additional_fields do not override document-level read permissions. To define a default fallback alongside field-level rules, leave read undefined and use additional_fields. write\nExpression\nDefault: undefined An expression that evaluates to true if the role has permission to add, modify, or remove all fields in the document. To maintain Sync compatibility, the expression must be a boolean literal (either true or false). Document-level write permissions take priority over any field-level permissions. If a role has document-level write permissions, it applies to all fields in the document. Write permissions specified by fields or additional_fields do not override document-level write permissions. To define a default fallback alongside field-level rules, leave write undefined and use additional_fields. You can use expansions like %%root and %%prevRoot in write JSON expressions. \nIMPORTANT \nIMPLICIT READ PERMISSION Any time a role has write permission for a particular scope it also has read permission even if that is not explicitly defined. insert\nExpression\nDefault: true An expression that evaluates to true if the role has permission to insert a new document into the collection. App Services only evaluates this expression for insert operations and only after determining that the role has write permission for all fields in the new document. delete\nExpression\nDefault: true An expression that evaluates to true if the role has permission to delete a document from the collection. App Services only evaluates this expression for delete operations and only after determining that the role has write permission for all fields in the document to be deleted. search\nBoolean\nDefault:

The root level schema must be an object schema, which has the following form: {  \"bsonType\": \"object\",  \"properties\": {    \"<Field Name>\": <Schema Document>  }} \nfilters\nArray<Document> An array of Filter configuration documents, which have the following form: {  \"name\": \"<Filter Name>\",  \"apply_when\": { Expression },  \"query\": { MongoDB Query },  \"projection\": { MongoDB Projection }} \nField\nDescription\nname\nString\nRequired. The name of the filter. Filter names are useful for identifying and distinguishing between filters. Limited to 100 characters or fewer.\napply_when\nExpression An expression that determines when this filter applies to an incoming MongoDB operation. \nIMPORTANT Atlas App Services evaluates and applies filters before it reads any documents, so you cannot use MongoDB document expansions in a filter's Apply When expression. However, you can use other expansions like %%user, %%values, and %function. query\nObject\nDefault: {} A MongoDB query that App Services merges into a filtered operation's existing query. \nEXAMPLE A filter withholds documents that have a score below 20 using the following query: { \"score\": { \"$gte\": 20 } } \nprojection\nObject\nDefault: {} A MongoDB projection that App Services merges into a filtered operation's existing projection. \nIMPORTANT \nPROJECTION CONFLICTS MongoDB projections can be either inclusive or exclusive, i.e. they can either return only specified fields or withhold fields that are not specified. If multiple filters apply to a query, the filters must all specify the same type of projection, or the query will fail. \nEXAMPLE A filter withholds the _internal field from all documents using the following projection: { \"_internal\": 0 }  \nEXTERNAL SERVICES \n3rd party services are defined in the /services directory. Each service maps to its own sub-directory with the same name as the service.

This metadata configuration file is an array of documents that each correspond to a single hosted file's metadata attributes. yourRealmApp/└── hosting/    ├── metadata.json    └── files/        └── <files to host> \nMETADATA CONFIGURATION \nmetadata.json [  {    \"path\": \"<File Resource Path>\",    \"attrs\": [{      \"name\": \"<Attribute Type>\",      \"value\": \"<Attribute Value>\"    }]  }] \nField\nDescription\npath\nString\nThe resource path of the file.\nattrs\nArray<Document> An array of documents where each document represents a single metadata attribute. Attribute documents have the following form: Metadata Attribute Document {  \"name\": \"<Attribute Type>\",  \"value\": \"<Attribute Value>\"} \nField\nDescription\nname\nString\nThe name of the metadata attribute. This should be one of the file metadata attributes that App Services supports.\nvalue\nString\nThe value of the metadata attribute. \nNOTE If you do not specify a Content-Type metadata attribute for a hosted file, Atlas App Services will attempt to automatically add a Content-Type attribute to it based on the file extension. For example, App Services would automatically add the attribute Content-Type: application/html to the file myPage.html. \nVALUES \nValues are defined in your application's /values directory. Each value is defined in its own JSON file named after the value. yourRealmApp/└── values/    └── <value name>.json \nCONFIGURATION \n<value name>.json {  \"id\": \"<Value ID>\",  \"name\": \"<Value

For more information, see Send Trigger Events to AWS EventBridge. disabled\nBoolean\nIf true, the trigger will not listen for any events and will not fire. \nDATABASE TRIGGERS \nDatabase trigger configurations conform to the base trigger schema with additional configuration options that specify which collection to watch and when to fire the trigger. The following fields exist in database trigger configuration files: triggers/<trigger name>.json {  \"name\": \"<Trigger Name>\",  \"type\": \"DATABASE\",  \"config\": {    \"service_name\": \"<MongoDB Service Name>\",    \"database\": \"<Database Name>\",    \"collection\": \"<Collection Name>\",    \"operation_types\": [\"<Operation Type>\", ...],    \"full_document\": <boolean>,    \"full_document_before_change\": <boolean>,    \"tolerate_resume_errors\": <boolean>,    \"unordered\": <boolean>,    \"match\": { <Match Filter> },    \"project\": { <Projection Filter> },  },  \"function_name\": \"<Trigger Function Name>\",  \"disabled\": <Boolean>} \nField\nDescription\nconfig.service_name\nString\nThe name of the MongoDB data source that contains the watched collection. You cannot define a database trigger on a serverless instance or Federated database instance.\nconfig.database\nString\nThe name of the MongoDB database that contains the watched collection.\nconfig.collection\nString\nThe name of the collection that the trigger watches.\nconfig.operation_types\nString[] A list of one or more database operation types that cause the trigger to fire. Valid operations types:  * \"INSERT\"  * \"UPDATE\"  * \"REPLACE\"  * \"DELETE\" \nTIP Update operations executed from MongoDB Compass or the MongoDB Atlas Data Explorer fully replace the previous document. As a result, update operations from these clients will generate REPLACE change events rather than UPDATE events. config.full_document\nBoolean If true, UPDATE change events include the latest majority-committed version of the modified document after the change was applied in the fullDocument field. \nNOTE Regardless of this setting:  * INSERT and REPLACE events always include the fullDocument field.  * DELETE events never include the fullDocument field. config.full_document_before_change\nBoolean If true, change events include a copy of the modified document from immediately before the change was applied in the fullDocumentBeforeChange field. All change events except for INSERT events include the document preimage. \nIMPORTANT \nCOLLECTION-LEVEL PREIMAGE SETTINGS Document preimages use extra information stored in the oplog. The extra data may have performance implications for some apps. Once you've enabled document preimages for any trigger on a given collection, that collection will include preimage data in the oplog and other triggers on the collection can use preimages with no

For more information, see Document Preimages. config.tolerate_resume_errors\nBoolean If true, the Trigger automatically resumes if the token required to process change stream events cannot be found. If enabled, when this Trigger's resume token cannot be found in the cluster's oplog, the Trigger automatically resumes processing events at the next relevant change stream event. All change stream events from when the Trigger was suspended until the Trigger resumes execution do not have the Trigger fire for them. For more information on resuming suspended Triggers, see Suspended Triggers. config.unordered\nBoolean If true, indicates that event ordering is disabled for this trigger. If event ordering is enabled, multiple executions of this Trigger will occur sequentially based on the timestamps of the change events. If event ordering is disabled, multiple executions of this Trigger will occur independently. \nTIP \nPERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION Improve performance for Triggers that respond to bulk database operations by disabling event ordering. Learn more. config.match\nDocument A $match expression document that App Services uses to filter which change events cause the Trigger to fire. The Trigger evaluates all change event objects that it receives against this match expression and only executes if the expression evaluates to true for a given change event. \nNOTE \nUSE DOT-NOTATION FOR EMBEDDED FIELDS MongoDB performs a full equality match for embedded documents in a match expression. If you want to match a specific field in an embedded document, refer to the field directly using dot-notation. For more information, see Query on Embedded Documents in the MongoDB server manual. \nTIP \nPERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION Limit the number of fields that the Trigger processes by using a $match expression. Learn more. config.project\nDocument A $project expression that selects a subset of fields from each event in the change stream. You can use this to optimize the trigger's execution. The expression is an object that maps the name of fields in the change event to either a 0, which excludes the field, or a 1, which includes it. An expression can have values of either 0 or 1 but not both together. This splits projections into two categories, inclusive and exclusive:  * An inclusive project expression specifies fields to include in each change event document. The expression is an object that maps the name of fields to include to a 1. If you don't include a field, it is not included in the projected change event.\n   \n   \n   EXAMPLE\n   \n   The following projection includes only the _id and fullDocument fields:\n   \n   {  _id: 1,  fullDocument: 1}\n   \n     * An exclusive project expression specifies fields to exclude from each change event document. The expression is an object that maps the name of fields to include to a 0. If you don't exclude a field, it is included in the projected change event.\n   \n   \n   EXAMPLE\n   \n   The following projection excludes the _id and fullDocument fields:\n   \n   {  _id: 0,  fullDocument: 0}\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   NOTE\n   \n   You cannot exclude the operation_type field with a projection. This ensures that the trigger can always check if it should run for a given event's operation type. \nAUTHENTICATION TRIGGERS \nAuthentication trigger configurations conform to the base trigger schema with additional configuration options that specify which auth providers to watch and when to fire the trigger. The following fields exist in authentication trigger configuration files: triggers/<trigger name>.json {  \"name\": \"<Trigger Name>\",  \"type\": \"AUTHENTICATION\",  \"config\": {    \"operation_type\": [\"<Operation Type>\", ...],    \"providers\": [\"<Provider Type>\", ...],  },  \"function_name\": \"<Trigger Function Name>\",  \"disabled\": <Boolean>} \nField\nDescription\nconfig.operation_type\nString The authentication operation type that causes the trigger to fire. Valid operations types:  * \"LOGIN\"  * \"CREATE\"  * \"DELETE\" config.providers\nString[] A list of authentication provider types that the trigger watches.

You configure the response by calling the methods on the Response object. If you do not configure the response, the endpoint returns a 200 - Ok response with the value returned from the endpont function as the request body. If false, requests return a 204 - No Content response with no data in the body. fetch_custom_user_data\nboolean If true, the authenticated user's custom user data document is available via context.user.custom_data. If false, the user's custom data is not queried and context.user.custom_data is an empty object. create_user_on_auth\nboolean If true, your app automatically creates a new user if the provided user credentials authenticate successfully but aren't associated with an existing user. This setting is useful for apps that integrate with external authentication system through the Custom JWT authentication provider. If a request includes a valid JWT from the external system that doesn't correspond to a registered user, this creates a new user with the JWT as an identity. disabled\nboolean\nEnables (false) or disables (true) the endpoint. \nDATA API CONFIGURATION \nDefine the configuration for your app's generated Data API endpoints in http_endpoints/data_api_config.json. {  \"disabled\": <boolean>,  \"versions\": [\"v1\"],  \"return_type\": \"EJSON\" | \"JSON\",  \"create_user_on_auth\": <boolean>,  \"run_as_system\": <boolean>,  \"run_as_user_id\": \"<User Account ID>\",  \"run_as_user_id_script_source\": \"<Function Source Code>\"} \nField\nDescription\ndisabled\nboolean\nIf false, the Data API is not enabled.

Sync. We recommend using Flexible Sync for all new apps. The information on this page is for users who are still using Partition-Based Sync. In Partition-Based Sync, documents in a synced cluster form a \"partition\" by having the same value for a field designated as \"partition key\". All documents in a partition have the same read/write permissions for a given user. In Partition-Based Sync, you define a partition key whose value determines whether the user can read or write a document. App Services evaluates a set of rules to determine whether users can read or write to a given partition. App Services directly maps a partition to individual synced .realm files. Each object in a synced realm has a corresponding document in the partition. \nEXAMPLE Consider an inventory management application using Partition-Based Sync. If you use store_number as the partition key, each store can read and write documents pertaining to its inventory. An example of the permissions for this type of app might be: { \"%%partition\": \"Store 42\" }  Store employees could have read and write access to documents whose store number is Store 42. Customers, meanwhile, could have read-only access to store inventory. In the client, you pass a value for the partition key when opening a synced realm. App Services then syncs objects whose partition key value matches the value passed in from the client application. \nEXAMPLE Based on the store inventory example above, the SDK might pass in store42 as the partitionValue in the sync configuration. This would sync any InventoryItem whose partitionValue was store42. You can use custom user data to indicate whether a logged-in user is a store employee or a customer. Store employees would have read and write permission for the store42 data set, while customers would have only read permission for the same data set. const config = {  schema: [InventoryItem], // predefined schema  sync: {    user: app.currentUser, // already logged in user    partitionValue: \"store42\",  },};try {  const realm = await Realm.open(config);  realm.close();} catch (err) {  console.error(\"failed to open realm\", err.message);}  \nKEY TERMS  PARTITION \nA partition is a collection of objects that share the same partition key value. A MongoDB Atlas cluster consists of several remote servers. These servers provide the storage for your synced data. The Atlas cluster stores documents in collections. Each MongoDB collection maps to a different Realm object type. Each document in a collection represents a specific Realm object. A synced realm is a local file on a device. A synced realm may contain some or all the objects relevant to the end user.

At a high level:      * A partition maps to a subset of the documents in a synced cluster.  * All documents in a partition have the same read/write permissions for a given user.  * Atlas App Services maps each partition to an individual synced .realm file.  * Each object in a synced realm has a corresponding document in the partition. Partitions shape data in an Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=realm-docs#atlas-form-container>`_ cluster. Each shape represents an object type. Partitions are determined by each shape's color: red, green, or blue. \nPARTITION KEY \nA partition key is a named field that you specify when you configure Atlas Device Sync. Device Sync uses this key to determine which partition contains a given document. Depending on your data model and the complexity of your app, your partition key could be either:  * A property that already exists in each document and that logically partitions data. For example, consider an app where every document is private to a specific user. You might store the user's ID value in an owner_id field and then use that as the partition key.  * A synthetic property that you create to partition data (e.g. _partition). You might use this when your app does not include a natural partition key. You can make the partition key required or optional on your objects. App Services maps any object that does not include a partition key to a default partition - null partition. Consider the following when choosing a partition key:  * Partition keys must be one of these types: String, ObjectID, Long, or UUID.  * App Services clients should never modify the partition value directly. You cannot use any field that clients can modify as a partition key.  * Partition keys use the same field name in every synced document. The partition key should not collide with any field name in any object's model. \nEXAMPLE The following schemas demonstrate natural and synthetic partition keys:  * The owner_id field is a natural key because it's already part of the app's data model.  * The _partition field is a synthetic key because its only purpose is to serve as a partition key. An app can only specify a single partition key, but either of these fields could work depending on your use case: {  \"title\": \"note\",  \"bsonType\": \"object\",  \"required\": [    \"_id\",    \"_partition\",    \"owner_id\",    \"text\"  ],  \"properties\": {    \"_id\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" },    \"_partition\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },    \"owner_id\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },    \"text\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" }  }}\n{  \"title\": \"notebook\",  \"bsonType\": \"object\",  \"required\": [    \"_id\",    \"_partition\",    \"owner_id\",    \"notes\"  ],  \"properties\": {    \"_id\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" },    \"_partition\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },    \"owner_id\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },    \"notes\": {      \"bsonType\": \"array\",      \"items\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" }    }  }}  CHANGE A PARTITION KEY \nYour app's partition key is a central part of a Sync-enabled app's data model. When you set a partition key in your Sync configuration, you cannot later reassign the key's field. If you need to change a partition key, you must terminate sync. Then, you can enable it again with the new partition key. However, this requires all client applications to reset and sync data into new realms. \nWARNING \nRESTORE SYNC AFTER TERMINATING SYNC When you terminate and re-enable Atlas Device Sync, clients can no longer Sync. Your client must implement a client reset handler to restore Sync. This handler can discard or attempt to recover unsynchronized changes.   PARTITION VALUE \nA partition value is a value of the partition key field for a given document. Documents with the same partition value belong to the same partition.

 * A delete from the old partition.  * An insert into the new partition. \nWARNING If you change a document's partition value, you lose client-side unsynced changes to the object. \nENABLE PARTITION-BASED SYNC  BEFORE YOU BEGIN \nYou will need the following to enable Partition-Based Sync:  * An App Services App. To learn how to create an App, see Create an App.  * A linked Atlas data source. To learn how to add a data source, see Link a Data Source. \nPROCEDURE   \nPARTITION-BASED RULES AND PERMISSIONS \nWhenever a user opens a synced realm from a client app, App Services evaluates your app's rules and determines if the user has read and write permissions for the partition. Users must have read permission to sync and read data in a realm and must have write permission to create, modify, or delete objects. Write permission implies read permission, so if a user has write permission then they also have read permission. \nPARTITION-BASED SYNC RULE BEHAVIOR \nSync rules apply to specific partitions and are coupled to your app's data model by the partition key. Consider the following behavior when designing your schemas to ensure that you have appropriate data access granularity and don't accidentally leak sensitive information.  * Sync rules apply dynamically based on the user. One user may have full read & write access to a partition while another user has only read permissions or is unable to access the partition entirely. You control these permissions by defining JSON expressions.  * Sync rules apply equally to all objects in a partition. If a user has read or write permission for a given partition then they can read or modify all synced fields of any object in the partition.  * Write permissions require read permissions, so a user with write access to a partition also has read access regardless of the defined read permission rules. \nPARTITION-BASED SYNC PERMISSIONS \nApp Services enforces dynamic, user-specific read and write permissions to secure the data in each partition. You define permissions with JSON rule expressions that control whether or not a given user has read or write access to the data in a given partition. App Services evaluates a user's permissions every time they open a synced realm. \nTIP Your rule expressions can use JSON expansions like %%partition and %%user to dynamically determine a user's permissions based on the context of their request. \nKEY CONCEPTS \nREAD PERMISSIONS \nA user with read permissions for a given partition can view all fields of any object in the corresponding synced realm. Read permissions do not permit a user to modify data. WRITE PERMISSIONS \nA user with write permissions for a given partition can modify the value of any field of any object in the corresponding synced realm. Write permissions require read permissions, so any user that can modify data can also view that data before and after it's modified. \nPERMISSION STRATEGIES \nYou can structure your read and write permission expressions as a set of permission strategies that apply to your partition strategy. The following strategies outline common approaches that you might take to define sync read and write permissions for your app. GLOBAL PERMISSIONS \nYou can define global permissions that apply to all users for all partitions. This is, in essence, a choice to not implement user-specific permissions in favor of universal read or write permissions that apply to all users. To define a global read or write permission, specify a boolean value or a JSON expression that always evaluates to the same boolean value. Example\nDescription true \nThe expression true means that all users have the given access permissions for all partitions. false \nThe expression false means that no users have the given access permissions for any partitions. { \"%%true\": true } \nThis expression always evaluates to true, so it's effectively the same as directly specifying true. PERMISSIONS FOR SPECIFIC PARTITIONS \nYou can define permissions that apply to a specific partition or a groups of partitions by explicitly specifying their partition values. Example\nDescription { \"%%partition\": \"PUBLIC\" } \nThis expression means that all users have the given access permissions for data with a partition value of \"Public\". {  \"%%partition\": {    \"$in\": [      \"PUBLIC (NA)\",      \"PUBLIC (EMEA)\",      \"PUBLIC (APAC)\"    ]  }} \nThis expression means that all users have the given access permissions for data with any of the specified partition values.

\nThis expression means that the user with id \"5f4863e4d49bd2191ff1e623\" has the given access permissions for data in any partition. {  \"%%user.id\": {    \"$in\": [      \"5f4863e4d49bd2191ff1e623\",      \"5f48640dd49bd2191ff1e624\",      \"5f486417d49bd2191ff1e625\"    ]  }} \nThis expression means that any user with one of the specified user ID values has the given access permissions for data in any partition. PERMISSIONS BASED ON USER DATA \nYou can define permissions that apply to users based on specific data defined in their custom user data document, metadata fields, or other data from an authentication provider. Example\nDescription { \"%%user.custom_data.readPartitions\" : \"%%partition\" } \nThis expression means that a user has read access to a partition if the partition value is listed in the readPartitions field of their custom user data. { \"%%user.data.writePartitions\" : \"%%partition\" } \nThis expression means that a user has write access to a partition if the partition value is listed in the data.writePartitions field of their user object. FUNCTION RULES \nYou can define complex dynamic permissions by evaluating a function that returns a boolean value. This is useful for permission schemes that require you to access external systems or other custom logic that you cannot express solely in JSON expressions. Example\nDescription {  \"%%true\": {    \"%function\": {      \"name\": \"canReadPartition\",      \"arguments\": [\"%%partition\"]    }  }}  // canReadPartitionexports = async (partition) => {  const cluster = context.services.get(\"mongodb-atlas\");  const permissions = cluster    .db(\"myApp\")    .collection(\"permissions\");  const { canRead } = await permissions.findOne({ partition });  return canRead.includes(context.user.id);} \nThis expression calls the canReadPartition function and passes in the partition value as its first and only argument. The function looks up the user's permissions for the partition from a MongoDB collection and then returns a boolean that indicates if the user can read data in the requested partition. \nPARTITION STRATEGIES \nA partition strategy is a key/value pattern to divide objects into partitions. Different use cases call for different partition strategies. You can compose partition strategies within the same app to form a larger strategy. This enables you to handle arbitrarily complex use cases. Which strategy to use depends on your app's data model and access patterns. Consider an app with both public and private data. You might put some data, like announcements, in a public partition. You might restrict other data, like personal information, to privileged users. When developing a partition strategy, consider:  * Data Security: Users may need different read and write access permissions to subsets of data. Consider the permissions users need for types of documents. A user has the same permissions for every document in a partition.  * Storage Capacity: Your client apps may have limited on-device storage on some devices and platforms. A partition strategy should take storage limitations into account. Make sure a user can store their synced data on their device. \nTIP \nCOMBINE STRATEGIES You can use a partition key name like _partition with a query string as the value. This lets you use multiple strategies in the same app. For example: _partitionKey: \"user_id=abcdefg\"_partitionKey: \"team_id=1234&city='New York, NY'\"  You can use functions and rule expressions to parse the string. Sync can determine whether a user has access to a partition based on the combined strategy. \nFIREHOSE STRATEGY \nA firehose partition strategy groups all documents into a single partition. With this structure, every user syncs all of your app's data to their device. This approach is functionally a decision to not partition data. This works for basic applications or small public data sets.  * Data Security. All data is public to clients with a realm that uses the partition. If a user has read or write access to the partition, they can read or write any document.  * Storage Capacity. Every user syncs every document in the partition. All data must fit within your most restrictive storage limitation.

You can also set a static partition value. This is when the partition value doesn't change based on the user or data. For example, realms across all clients could use the partition value \"MyPartitionValue\". \nEXAMPLE An app lets users browse scores and statistics for local high school baseball games. Consider the following documents in the games and teams collections: collection games: [  { teams: [\"Brook Ridge Miners\", \"Southside Rockets\"], score: { ... }, date: ... }  { teams: [\"Brook Ridge Miners\", \"Uptown Bombers\"], score: { ... }, date: ... }  { teams: [\"Brook Ridge Miners\", \"Southside Rockets\"], score: { ... }, date: ... }  { teams: [\"Southside Rockets\", \"Uptown Bombers\"], score: { ... }, date: ... }  { teams: [\"Brook Ridge Miners\", \"Uptown Bombers\"], score: { ... }, date: ... }  { teams: [\"Southside Rockets\", \"Uptown Bombers\"], score: { ... }, date: ... }]\ncollection teams: [  { name: \"Brook Ridge Miners\" }  { name: \"Southside Rockets\" }  { name: \"Uptown Bombers\" }]  The total number of games is small. A small number of local teams only play a few games each year. Most devices should be able to download all game data for easy offline access. In this case, the firehose strategy is appropriate. The data is public and documents don't need a partition key. The strategy maps the collections to the following realms: realm null: [  Game { teams: [\"Brook Ridge Miners\", \"Southside Rockets\"], score: { ... }, date: ... }  Game { teams: [\"Brook Ridge Miners\", \"Uptown Bombers\"], score: { ... }, date: ... }  Game { teams: [\"Brook Ridge Miners\", \"Southside Rockets\"], score: { ... }, date: ... }  Game { teams: [\"Southside Rockets\", \"Uptown Bombers\"], score: { ... }, date: ... }  Game { teams: [\"Brook Ridge Miners\", \"Uptown Bombers\"], score: { ... }, date: ... }  Game { teams: [\"Southside Rockets\", \"Uptown Bombers\"], score: { ... }, date: ... }  Team { name: \"Brook Ridge Miners\" }  Team { name: \"Southside Rockets\" }  Team { name: \"Uptown Bombers\" }]  \nUSER STRATEGY \nA user partition strategy groups private documents for each user. These documents go into a partition specific to that user. This works when each document has an owner, and nobody else needs the data. A username or ID that identifies the owner makes a natural partition key.  * Data Security. Data in a user partition is specific to a given user. It may contain information private to that user. Each user syncs only their own partition. Other users cannot access documents in the partition.  * Storage Capacity. Each user only syncs data from their own partition. Their data must fit within their device's storage constraints. Use this strategy only when each user has a manageable amount of data. \nEXAMPLE A music streaming app stores data about playlists and song ratings for each user. Consider the following documents in the playlists and ratings collections: collection playlists: [  { name: \"Work\", owner_id: \"dog_enthusiast_95\", song_ids: [ ... ] }  { name: \"Party\", owner_id: \"cat_enthusiast_92\", song_ids: [ ... ] }  { name: \"Soup Tunes\", owner_id: \"dog_enthusiast_95\", song_ids: [ ... ] }  { name: \"Disco Anthems\", owner_id: \"PUBLIC\", song_ids: [ ... ] }  { name: \"Deep Focus\", owner_id: \"PUBLIC\", song_ids: [ ... ] }]\ncollection ratings: [  { owner_id: \"dog_enthusiast_95\", song_id: 3, rating: -1 }  { owner_id: \"cat_enthusiast_92\", song_id: 1, rating: 1 }  { owner_id: \"dog_enthusiast_95\", song_id: 1, rating: 1 }]  Every document includes the owner_id field. This is a good partition key for a user partition strategy. It naturally maps documents to individual users.

 * Every user has read access to the realm for partition value PUBLIC. This contains playlists that are available to all users. The strategy maps the collections to the following realms: realm dog_enthusiast_95: [  Playlist { name: \"Work\", owner_id: \"dog_enthusiast_95\", song_ids: [ ... ] }  Playlist { name: \"Soup Tunes\", owner_id: \"dog_enthusiast_95\", song_ids: [ ... ] }  Rating { owner_id: \"dog_enthusiast_95\", song_id: 3, rating: -1 }  Rating { owner_id: \"dog_enthusiast_95\", song_id: 1, rating: 1 }]\nrealm cat_enthusiast_92: [  Playlist { name: \"Party\", owner_id: \"cat_enthusiast_92\", song_ids: [ ... ] }  Rating { owner_id: \"cat_enthusiast_92\", song_id: 1, rating: 1 }]\nrealm PUBLIC: [  Playlist { name: \"Disco Anthems\", owner_id: \"PUBLIC\", song_ids: [ ... ] }  Playlist { name: \"Deep Focus\", owner_id: \"PUBLIC\", song_ids: [ ... ] }]  \nTEAM STRATEGY \nA team partition strategy groups private documents shared by a team of users. A team might include a store location's employees or a band's members. Each team has a partition specific to that group. All users in the team share access and ownership of the team's documents.  * Data Security. Data in a team partition is specific to a given team. It may contain data private to the team but not to a member of the team. Each user syncs partitions for the teams they belong to. Users not in a team cannot access documents in the team's partition.  * Storage Capacity: Each user only syncs data from their own teams. The data from a user's teams must fit within their device's storage constraints. Use this strategy when users belong to a manageable number of teams. If users belong to many teams, the combined realms could contain a lot of data. You may need to limit the number of team partitions synced at a time. \nEXAMPLE An app lets users create projects to collaborate with other users. Consider the following documents in the projects and tasks collections: collection projects: [  { name: \"CLI\", owner_id: \"cli-team\", task_ids: [ ... ] }  { name: \"API\", owner_id: \"api-team\", task_ids: [ ... ] }]\ncollection tasks: [  { status: \"complete\", owner_id: \"api-team\", text: \"Import dependencies\" }  { status: \"inProgress\", owner_id: \"api-team\", text: \"Create app MVP\" }  { status: \"inProgress\", owner_id: \"api-team\", text: \"Investigate off-by-one issue\" }  { status: \"todo\", owner_id: \"api-team\", text: \"Write tests\" }  { status: \"inProgress\", owner_id: \"cli-team\", text: \"Create command specifications\" }  { status: \"todo\", owner_id: \"cli-team\", text: \"Choose a CLI framework\" }]  Every document includes the owner_id field. This is a good partition key for a team partition strategy. It naturally maps documents to individual teams. This limits the data on each device. Users only have projects and tasks that are relevant to them.  * Users have read and write access to partitions owned by teams where they're a member.  * Data stored in a teams or users collection can map users to team membership:\n   \n   collection teams: [  { name: \"cli-team\", member_ids: [ ... ] }  { name: \"api-team\", member_ids: [ ... ] }]\n   collection users: [  { name: \"Joe\", team_ids: [ ... ] }  { name: \"Liz\", team_ids: [ ... ] }  { name: \"Matt\", team_ids: [ ... ] }  { name: \"Emmy\", team_ids: [ ... ] }  { name: \"Scott\", team_ids: [ ... ] }]\n   \n    The strategy

 \nCHANNEL STRATEGY \nA channel partition strategy groups documents for a common topic or domain. Each topic or domain has its own partition. Users can choose to access or subscribe to specific channels. A name or ID may identify these channels in a public list.  * Data Security. Data in a channel partition is specific to a topic or area. Users can choose to access these channels. You can limit a user's access to a subset of channels. You could prevent users from accessing channels entirely. When user has read or write permission for a channel, they can access any document in the partition.  * Storage Capacity. Users can choose to sync data from any allowed channel. All data from a user's channels must fit within their device's storage constraints. Use this strategy to partition public or semi-private data sets. This strategy breaks up data sets that would not fit within storage constraints. \nEXAMPLE An app lets users create chatrooms based on topics. Users can search for and join channels for any topic that interests them. Consider these documents in the chatrooms and messages collections: collection chatrooms: [  { topic: \"cats\", description: \"A place to talk about cats\" }  { topic: \"sports\", description: \"We like sports and we don't care who knows\" }]\ncollection messages: [  { topic: \"cats\", text: \"Check out this cute pic of my cat!\", timestamp: 1625772933383 }  { topic: \"cats\", text: \"Can anybody recommend a good cat food brand?\", timestamp: 1625772953383 }  { topic: \"sports\", text: \"Did you catch the game last night?\", timestamp: 1625772965383 }  { topic: \"sports\", text: \"Yeah what a comeback! Incredible!\", timestamp: 1625772970383 }  { topic: \"sports\", text: \"I can't believe how they scored that goal.\", timestamp: 1625773000383 }]  Every document includes the topic field. This is a good partition key for a channel partition strategy. It naturally maps documents to individual channels. This reduces the data on each device. Data only contains messages and metadata for channels the user has chosen.  * Users have read and write access to chatrooms where they're subscribed. Users can change or delete any message - even those sent by other users. To limit write permissions, you could give users read-only access. Then, handle sending messages with a serverless function.  * Store the use's subscribed channels in either the chatrooms or users collection:\n   \n   collection chatrooms: [  { topic: \"cats\", subscriber_ids: [ ... ] }  { topic: \"sports\", subscriber_ids: [ ... ] }]\n   collection users: [  { name: \"Joe\", chatroom_ids: [ ... ] }  { name: \"Liz\", chatroom_ids: [ ... ] }  { name: \"Matt\", chatroom_ids: [ ... ] }  { name: \"Emmy\", chatroom_ids: [ ... ] }  { name: \"Scott\", chatroom_ids: [ ... ] }]\n   \n    The strategy maps the collections to the following realms: realm cats: [  Chatroom { topic: \"cats\", description: \"A place to talk about cats\" }  Message { topic: \"cats\", text: \"Check out this cute pic of my cat!\", timestamp: 1625772933383 }  Message { topic: \"cats\", text: \"Can anybody recommend a good cat food brand?\", timestamp: 1625772953383 }]\nrealm sports: [  Chatroom { topic: \"sports\", description: \"We like sports and we don't care who knows\" }  Message { topic: \"sports\", text: \"Did you catch the game last night?\", timestamp: 1625772965383 }  Message { topic: \"sports\", text: \"Yeah what a comeback! Incredible!\", timestamp: 1625772970383 }  Message { topic: \"sports\", text: \"I can't believe how they scored that goal.\", timestamp: 1625773000383 }]  \nREGION STRATEGY \nA region partition strategy groups documents related to a location or region. Each partition contains documents specific to those areas.  * Data Security. Data is specific to a given geographic area. You can limit a user's access to their current region.

\nEXAMPLE An app lets users search for nearby restaurants and order from their menus. Consider the following documents in the restaurants collection: collection restaurants: [  { city: \"New York, NY\", name: \"Joe's Pizza\", menu: [ ... ] }  { city: \"New York, NY\", name: \"Han Dynasty\", menu: [ ... ] }  { city: \"New York, NY\", name: \"Harlem Taste\", menu: [ ... ] }  { city: \"Chicago, IL\", name: \"Lou Malnati's\", menu: [ ... ] }  { city: \"Chicago, IL\", name: \"Al's Beef\", menu: [ ... ] }  { city: \"Chicago, IL\", name: \"Nando's\", menu: [ ... ] }]  Every document includes the city field. This is a good partition key for a region partition strategy. It naturally maps documents to specific physical areas. This limits data to messages and metadata for a user's current city. Users have read access to restaurants in their current region. You could determine the user's region in your application logic. The strategy maps the collections to the following realms: realm New York, NY: [ { city: \"New York, NY\", name: \"Joe's Pizza\", menu: [ ... ] } { city: \"New York, NY\", name: \"Han Dynasty\", menu: [ ... ] } { city: \"New York, NY\", name: \"Harlem Taste\", menu: [ ... ] }]\nrealm Chicago, IL: [ { city: \"Chicago, IL\", name: \"Lou Malnati's\", menu: [ ... ] } { city: \"Chicago, IL\", name: \"Al's Beef\", menu: [ ... ]  } { city: \"Chicago, IL\", name: \"Nando's\", menu: [ ... ]  }]  \nBUCKET STRATEGY \nA bucket partition strategy groups documents by range. When documents range along a dimension, a partition contains a subrange. Consider time-based bucket ranges. Triggers move documents to new partitions when they fall out of their bucket range.  * Data Security. Limit users to read or write only specific buckets. Data may flow between buckets. Consider access permissions for a document across all possible buckets.  * Storage Capacity. Storage needs vary based on size and usage patterns for each bucket. Consider which buckets users need to access. Limit the size of buckets to fit within a device's storage constraints. If users sync many buckets, partition into smaller buckets. This helps avoid syncing unneeded data. \nEXAMPLE An IoT app shows real-time views of sensor readings several times a second. Buckets derive from the number of seconds since the reading came in. Consider these documents in the readings collection: collection readings: [  { bucket: \"0s<t<=60s\", timestamp: 1625773000383 , data: { ... } }  { bucket: \"0s<t<=60s\", timestamp: 1625772970383 , data: { ... } }  { bucket: \"0s<t<=60s\", timestamp: 1625772965383 , data: { ... } }  { bucket: \"60s<t<=300s\", timestamp: 1625772953383 , data: { ... } }  { bucket: \"60s<t<=300s\", timestamp: 1625772933383 , data: { ... } }]  Every document includes the bucket field. This field maps documents to specific time ranges. A user's device only contains sensor readings for the window they view.  * Users have read access to sensor readings for any time bucket.  * Sensors use client apps with write access to upload readings. The strategy maps the collections to the following realms: realm 0s<t<=60s: [  Reading { bucket: \"0s<t<=60s\", timestamp: 1625773000383 , data: { ... } }  Reading { bucket: \"0s<t<=60s\", timestamp: 1625772970383 , data: { ... } }  Reading { bucket: \"0s<t<=60s\", timestamp: 1625772965383 , data: { ... } }]\nrealm 60s<t<=300s: [  Reading { bucket: \"60s<t<=300s\", timestamp: 1625772953383 , data:

\nPARTITION-BASED SYNC CONFIGURATION \nWhen you use Partition-Based Sync, your Atlas App Services app uses this Sync configuration: sync/config.json {  \"type\": \"partition\",  \"state\": <\"enabled\" | \"disabled\">,  \"development_mode_enabled\": <Boolean>,  \"service_name\": \"<Data Source Name>\",  \"database_name\": \"<Development Mode Database Name>\",  \"partition\": {    \"key\": \"<Partition Key Field Name>\",    \"type\": \"<Partition Key Type>\",    \"permissions\": {      \"read\": { <Expression> },      \"write\": { <Expression> }    }  },  \"last_disabled\": <Number>,  \"client_max_offline_days\": <Number>,  \"is_recovery_mode_disabled\": <Boolean>} \nField\nDescription\ntype\nString The sync mode. There are two Sync modes: Flexible Sync and the older Partition-Based Sync. Valid Options for a Partition-Based Sync Configuration:  * \"partition\" state\nString The current state of the sync protocol for the application. Valid Options:  * \"enabled\"  * \"disabled\" service_name\nString\nThe name of the MongoDB data source to sync. You cannot use sync with a serverless instance or Federated database instance.\ndevelopment_mode_enabled\nBoolean\nIf true, Development Mode is enabled for the application. While enabled, App Services automatically stores synced objects in a specific database (specified in database_name) and mirrors objects types in that database's collection schemas.\ndatabase_name\nString\nThe name of a database in the synced cluster where App Services stores data in Development Mode. App Services automatically generates a schema for each synced type and maps each object type to a collection within the database.\npartition.key\nString\nThe field name of your app's partition key. This field must be defined in the schema for object types that you want to sync.\npartition.type\nString The value type of the partition key field. This must match the type defined in the object schema. Valid Options:  * \"string\"  * \"objectId\"  * \"long\" partition.permissions.read\nExpression\nAn expression that evaluates to true when a user has permission to read objects in a partition. If the expression evaluates to false, App Services does not allow the user to read an object or its properties.\npartition.permissions.write\nExpression\nAn expression that evaluates to true when a user has permission to write objects in a partition. If the expression evaluates to false, App Services does not allow the user to modify an object or its properties. Write permission requires read permission. A user cannot write to a document that they cannot read.\nlast_disabled\nNumber\nThe date and time that sync was last paused or disabled, represented by the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).\nclient_max_offline_days\nNumber\nControls how long the backend compaction process waits before aggressively pruning metadata that some clients require to synchronize from an old version of a realm.\nis_recovery_mode_disabled\nBoolean\nIf false, Recovery Mode is enabled for the application. While enabled, Realm SDKs that support this feature attempt to recover unsynced changes upon performing a client reset. Recovery mode is enabled by default. \nALTER YOUR PARTITION-BASED SYNC CONFIGURATION \nYou must Terminate Device Sync and Re-enable Device Sync to make changes to your Partition-Based Device Sync Configuration. While you are re-enabling Atlas Device Sync, you can specify a new Partition Key, or changes to your Read/Write Permissions. Making changes to your Device Sync configuration while terminating and re-enabling Device Sync will trigger a client reset.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nEXPOSE DATA IN A COLLECTION \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Procedure\n * 1. Configure Roles for the Collection\n * 2. Define a Schema for Documents in the Collection\n * 3. Define Relationships to Other Collections\n * 4. Name the Data Type\n * Next Steps \nOVERVIEW \nYou can expose data from a MongoDB collection to client applications through the Atlas GraphQL API. Atlas App Services automatically generates GraphQL types and resolvers based on the collection schema and enforces collection rules for all GraphQL operations. \nPROCEDURE  1. CONFIGURE ROLES FOR THE COLLECTION \nApp Services enforces collection rules for all incoming GraphQL requests, so you need to define at least one collection role with the permissions that your application requires. All GraphQL requests include an authentication token that identifies the logged in App Services user that sent the request. App Services evaluates a role for every document included in a GraphQL operation and only returns fields and documents that the user has permission to see. If App Services omits a field, the field has a null value in the returned document. \n2. DEFINE A SCHEMA FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE COLLECTION \nGraphQL requires that all data conforms to a well-defined type, so you must define a schema for documents in the collection. App Services automatically generates GraphQL types and resolvers for documents in the collection based on the collection schema and regenerates new types whenever the schema changes. \nNOTE \nAUTOMATICALLY GENERATE A SCHEMA App Services can generate a collection schema for you based on a sample of existing documents in the collection. If you don't have existing data, you can insert a new document that has a mock implementation of the fields you want to include in your schema and then generate a schema based on the mock. \n3. DEFINE RELATIONSHIPS TO OTHER COLLECTIONS \nYou can define relationships that connect each document in the collection to one or more documents in a foreign collection. To learn how to define a relationship, see Define a Relationship. Relationships allow you to fluently reference and query related documents in GraphQL read and write operations. For example, you can query for a person and include the full document for each of their children from the same people collection: query {  person(query: { name: \"Molly Weasley\" }) {    _id    name    age    picture    children {      _id      name      age      picture    }  }}  \n4. NAME THE DATA TYPE \nApp Services names the GraphQL types that it generates based on the data type that documents in the collection conform to. You can configure the name of the GraphQL types by setting the title field in a schema to the name of the data type that the schema defines. There are three situations where you can set the title field:      * You can define the type name for each document in a collection by setting title at the root level of the schema. If you don't specify a title, App Services uses the name of the collection instead.  * You can define the type name for an embedded object by setting title in the embedded object schema.  * You can define the type name for a field that has a defined relationship by setting title in the field schema. App Services uses the title instead of the defined field name when it resolves relationships in GraphQL. {  \"title\": \"movie\",  \"properties\": {    \"_id\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" },    \"title\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },    \"year\": { \"bsonType\": \"int\" },    \"director\": { \"bsonType\": \"int\" }  }}  \nNOTE \nSINGULAR AND PLURAL TYPES App Services generates two GraphQL queries for each collection:  * A singular query that finds a specific document in the collection. The query uses the same name as the schema's title. If the schema's title is a plural noun, App Services attempts to use its singular form as determined by the Rails ActiveSupport inflection rules.  * A plural query that finds a subset of all documents in the collection. If possible, the query uses the plural form of the singular query name. If App Services is unable to pluralize the name or if the pluralized name is the same as the singular name, the plural query uses the same name as the singular query with an additional \"s\" appended

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nAUTHENTICATE GRAPHQL REQUESTS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Bearer Authentication\n * Credential Headers\n * Email/Password\n * API Key\n * Custom JWT \nOVERVIEW \nThe GraphQL API requires that incoming requests include authentication information for the user making the request. This lets the API enforce rules and validate document schemas for each operation. Requests must include authentication data in specific request headers. App Services uses the following process to authenticate a given request:       1. Check for an Authorization header. If it's present, the request must use Bearer Authentication with a valid user access token. If the token is invalid, the request fails.  2. If the Authorization header is not present, check for Credential Headers. The headers must contain valid Email/Password, API Key, or Custom JWT credentials for an App user. \nNOTE You must enable an authentication provider before users can authenticate with it. \nBEARER AUTHENTICATION \nThe GraphQL API supports Bearer Authentication, which lets you authenticate a request by including a valid user access token in the Authorization header. To learn how to get and manage an access token, see Manage User Sessions. The Authorization header uses the following format: Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>  For example, the following request uses Bearer Authentication: curl -X POST 'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/client/v2.0/app/<AppID>/graphql' \\   --header 'Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>' \\   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\   --data-raw '{     \"query\": \"query AllMovies {\\n  movies {\\n    title\\n    year\\n  }\\n}\"   }'  In general, bearer authentication with an access token has higher throughput and is more secure than credential headers. Use an access token instead of credential headers when possible. The token lets you run multiple requests without re-authenticating the user. It also lets you send requests from a web browser that enforces CORS. \nIMPORTANT \nDON'T USE API KEYS IN USER-FACING CLIENTS If you're authenticating from a browser or another user-facing client application, avoid using an API key to log in. Instead, use another authentication provider that takes user-provided credentials. Never store API keys or other sensitive credentials locally. Bearer authentication is useful for:  * sending requests from a web browser.  * sending multiple requests without storing user credentials or prompting the user on each request.  * sending requests from an app that also uses a Realm SDK to authenticate users. \nCREDENTIAL HEADERS \nYou can authenticate a GraphQL request by including the user's login credentials in the request headers. The exact headers to include depend on the authentication provider. Credential headers are useful for:  * requests sent from a server-side application  * requests sent from a command-line tool  * manual or test requests sent from a GraphQL client like Postman \nIMPORTANT You cannot use credential headers to authenticate requests sent from a web browser due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing restrictions. Instead, to authenticate GraphQL requests from a browser, use Bearer Authentication. \nEMAIL/PASSWORD \nTo authenticate a GraphQL request as an email/password user, include the user's credentials in the request's email and password headers. curl -X POST 'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/client/v2.0/app/<AppID>/graphql' \\   --header 'email: <EmailAddress>' \\   --header 'password: <Password>' \\   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\   --data-raw '{     \"query\": \"query AllMovies {\\n  movies {\\n    title\\n    year\\n  }\\n}\"   }'  \nAPI KEY \nTo authenticate a GraphQL request with

\nField\nDescription\nref\nString A JSON schema $ref string that specifies the foreign collection. The string has the following form: #/relationship/<Data Source Name>/<Database Name>/<Collection Name> \nsource_key\nString\nThe name of the field in this collection's schema that specifies which documents in the foreign collection to include in the relationship. A foreign document is included if source_key contains the value of its foreign_key field.\nforeign_key\nString\nThe name of the field in the foreign collection's schema that contains the value referenced by source_key.\nis_list\nBoolean If true, the relationship may refer to multiple foreign documents (i.e. a \"to-many\" relationship). The source_key field must be an array with elements of the same type as the foreign_key field. If false, the relationship may refer to zero or one foreign documents (i.e. a \"to-one\" relationship). The source_key field must be the same type as the foreign_key field. \nEXAMPLE An ecommerce app defines a relationship between two collections: each document in store.orders references one or more documents in the store.items collection by including item _id values in the order's items array. Both collection are in the same linked cluster (mongodb-atlas) and database (store). The relationship is defined for the orders collection: /data_sources/mongodb-atlas/store/orders/relationships.json {  \"items\": {    \"ref\": \"#/relationship/mongodb-atlas/store/items\",    \"source_key\": \"items\",    \"foreign_key\": \"_id\",    \"is_list\": true  }}  \nDEFAULT RULES \nYou can define default rules that apply to all collections in a data source that don't have more specific collection-level rules defined. You define default rules in the data source's default_rule.json configuration file at data_sources/<data-source-name>/default_rule.json. /data_sources/<data source>/default_rule.json {  \"roles\": [<Role>],  \"filters\": [<Filter>]} \nField\nDescription\nroles\nArray<Role>\nAn array of Role configurations.\nfilters\nArray<Filter>\nAn array of Filter configurations. \nCOLLECTION RULES \nIf the data source is not a Federated data source, then you can define collection-level rules in a collection's rules.json configuration file. /data_sources/<data source>/<database>/<collection>/rules.json {  \"database\": \"<Database Name>\",  \"collection\": \"<Collection Name>\",  \"roles\": [<Role>],  \"filters\": [<Filter>]} \nField\nDescription\ndatabase\nString\nThe name of the database that holds the collection.\ncollection\nString\nThe name of the collection.\nroles\nArray<Role>\nAn array of Role configurations.\nfilters\nArray<Filter>\nAn array of Filter configurations. \nRULE CONFIGURATIONS  ROLES \n{   \"name\": \"<Role Name>\",   \"apply_when\": { Expression },   \"document_filters\": {     \"read\": { Expression },     \"write\": { Expression }   },   \"read\": { Expression },   \"write\": { Expression },   \"insert\": { Expression },   \"delete\": { Expression },   \"search\": <Boolean>,   \"fields\": {      \"<Field Name>\": {         \"read\": { Expression },         \"write\": { Expression },         \"fields\": { Embedded Fields }      },      ...   },   \"additional_fields\": {     \"read\": { Expression },     \"write\": { Expression }   }} \nField\nDescription\nname\nstring\nThe name of the role. Role names identify and distinguish between roles in the same collection.

To assign a role, App Services evaluates the apply_when of each potential role until one evaluates to true. Potential roles are any roles specified in the rules.json configuration file for the given collection or, if no rules.json file is found for the given collection, the default role(s). App Services evaluates roles in the order that you specify them in your configuration. If no role matches, then access is denied. For more information, see Role-based Permissions. If Device Sync (Flexible Mode) is enabled, the assigned roles must be Sync compatible. If the role is not Sync compatible, but its apply_when evaluated to true, others roles are not considered; access is denied. document_filters\nDocument\nDefault: undefined A document with read and write expressions that determine whether the role's other permissions may be evaluated. If Device Sync is enabled, both document_filters.read and document_filters.write must be defined to make the role Sync compatible. Sync incompatible roles deny all access to Sync requests. If Device Sync is not enabled, document_filters, document_filters.read, and document_filters.write are all optional; an undefined document_filters.read or document_filters.write defaults to true, allowing subsequent permissions to be evaluated. \"document_filters\": {  \"read\": { Expression },  \"write\": { Expression }} \ndocument_filters.read\nExpression\nDefault: undefined An expression that specifies whether read, read permissions in fields, and read permissions in additional_fields may be evaluated. If false (and document_filters.write is undefined or false), read access is denied for the entire document. To maintain Sync compatibility, the expression must be defined and may only reference queryable fields. document_filters.write\nExpression\nDefault: undefined An expression that specifies whether write, write permissions in fields, and write permissions in additional_fields may be evaluated. If false, then write access is denied for the entire document. To maintain Sync compatibility, the expression must be defined and may only reference queryable fields. read\nExpression\nDefault: undefined An expression that evaluates to true if the role has permission to read all fields in the document. To maintain Sync compatibility, the expression must be a boolean literal (either true or false). Document-level read permissions take priority over any field-level permissions. If a role has document-level read permissions, it applies to all fields in the document. Read permissions specified by fields or additional_fields do not override document-level read permissions. To define a default fallback alongside field-level rules, leave read undefined and use additional_fields. write\nExpression\nDefault: undefined An expression that evaluates to true if the role has permission to add, modify, or remove all fields in the document. To maintain Sync compatibility, the expression must be a boolean literal (either true or false). Document-level write permissions take priority over any field-level permissions. If a role has document-level write permissions, it applies to all fields in the document. Write permissions specified by fields or additional_fields do not override document-level write permissions. To define a default fallback alongside field-level rules, leave write undefined and use additional_fields. You can use expansions like %%root and %%prevRoot in write JSON expressions. \nIMPORTANT \nIMPLICIT READ PERMISSION Any time a role has write permission for a particular scope it also has read permission even if that is not explicitly defined. insert\nExpression\nDefault: true An expression that evaluates to true if the role has permission to insert a new document into the collection. App Services only evaluates this expression for insert operations and only after determining that the role has write permission for all fields in the new document. delete\nExpression\nDefault: true An expression that evaluates to true if the role has permission to delete a document from the collection. App Services only evaluates this expression for delete operations and only after determining that the role has write permission for all fields in the document to be deleted. search\nBoolean\nDefault: true An expression that evaluates to true if the role has permission to search the collection using Atlas Search. \nIMPORTANT App Services performs $search operations as a system user and enforces field-level rules on the returned search results. This means that a user may search on a field for which they do not have read access. In this case, the search is based on the specified field but no returned documents include the field. fields\nDocument\nDefault: {}  A document where each key corresponds to a field name, and each value defines the role's field-level read and write permissions for the corresponding field in a queried document.

For each collection, App Services generates the following:      * A document type that represents a single document in the collection  * A set of queries and mutations that allow you to access and manipulate documents in the collection.  * A set of input types that allow you to filter queries, modify specific fields, and sort results. \nNOTE \nEXAMPLE COLLECTION SCHEMA This page includes examples that demonstrate generated values based on the following schema for a movies collection: {  \"title\": \"Movie\",  \"required\": [\"title\"],  \"properties\": {    \"_id\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" },    \"title\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },    \"year\": { \"bsonType\": \"int\" },    \"rated\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },    \"runtime\": { \"bsonType\": \"int\" },    \"director\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" },    \"reviews\": {      \"bsonType\": \"array\",      \"items\": { \"bsonType\": \"objectId\" }    },    \"cast\": {      \"bsonType\": \"array\",      \"items\": { \"bsonType\": \"string\" }    }  }}  \nSCALAR TYPES \nApp Services supports all of the standard GraphQL scalar types and also generates the ObjectId scalar. The following scalar types are supported:  * ObjectId: An ObjectId value serialized as a string  * Boolean: true or false  * String: A UTF‐8 character sequence  * Int: A signed 32‐bit integer  * Long: A signed 64‐bit integer  * Float: A signed double-precision floating-point value  * DateTime: An RFC 3339 UTC DateTime (e.g. \"2020-09-01T15:38:14.918Z\") \nDOCUMENT TYPES \nApp Services generates a single GraphQL type for the documents in a collection based on the collection schema. The type uses the name set in the title field of the schema or the collection name if no title is specified. type Movie {  _id: ObjectId  title: String!  year: Int  rated: String  runtime: Int  director: String  cast: [String]}  \nFIELD MAPPING \nApp Services attempts to map fields in your collection schema directly to fields in your GraphQL types. The definition of valid names described in the GraphQL spec does not support all possible valid document field names, so App Services applies the following transformation rules to determine field names in generated GraphQL types:  * strip unsupported characters  * strip leading numbers  * convert to camel case  * omit fields that begin with a double underscore (e.g. __myField) \nBSON TYPE MAPPING \nThe GraphQL type system is similar but not identical to the BSON types that you can use in a schema. App Services automatically attempts to map between the BSON types in your schema and supported GraphQL types. If a field type does not have a GraphQL equivalent, App Services does not include the field in the generated GraphQL document type. The following table lists BSON types that you can use in a schema and the GraphQL types that they map to: JSON/BSON Type\nGraphQL Type\nobjectId\nObjectId\nint\nInt\nlong\nInt\ndouble\nFloat\ndecimal\nFloat\ndate\nDateTime\ntimestamp\nDateTime \nNOTE JSON supports two types that represent \"no value\": undefined and null. The GraphQL spec supports null but not undefined, so your app converts undefined values in the following way:  * If a document field is explicitly set to undefined then the corresponding GraphQL type

\nINPUT TYPES \nGraphQL uses input types to represent parameters that you pass to queries and mutations. This is a standard approach used by all GraphQL APIs to define unambiguous, type-safe user inputs. \nQUERYINPUT \nA QueryInput object defines a set of one or more conditions that a document must meet in order to be included in a query. The object may include fields from the document type as well as any of the operator fields that App Services automatically generates based on each field's type.  * Document Fields: If a QueryInput field has the same name as a field in the document type, then App Services matches a document if the value specified in the input field and the value of the field in the document are the same.\n   \n   \n   EXAMPLE\n   \n   The following query includes a QueryInput with two fields, rated and year. Both of these field names are defined in the Movie document type, so App Services performs an equality match for both.\n   \n   The query returns the title of all movies released in the year 2000 that are rated R.\n   \n   movies(query: { rated: \"R\", year: 2000 }) {  title}\n   \n     * Operator Fields: If a QueryInput field is a valid operator field for the queried type, then App Services matches a document if the operator evaluates to true.\n   \n   \n   EXAMPLE\n   \n   The following query includes a QueryInput with two fields, rated_in and year_gt. Both of these are operator fields, so App Services evaluates each operator to determine if a document matches.\n   \n   The query returns the title of all movies released after the year 2000 that are rated either G or PG-13.\n   \n   movies(query: { rated_in: [\"G\", \"PG-13\"], year_gt: 2000 }) {  title}\n   \n    COMPARISON OPERATOR FIELDS \nA comparison operator field allows you to define a condition that is more complex than exact equality, such as a range query. App Services generates a set of comparison operator fields for every field in the document type based on the field type. Each comparison operator typically applies to only a subset of all field types, so App Services only generates operator fields for valid combinations.

\nEXAMPLE This query finds all movies that feature either or both of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling: movies(query: { cast_in: [\"Emma Stone\", \"Ryan Gosling\"] }) {  title  year} \nnin\nInt\nFloat\nString\nBoolean\nObjectId\nDateTime\nArray\n[<Field Type>] Finds documents where the field is not equal to any value in the specified array. If the field is an Array, this finds all documents where any value in the field array is also in the specified array. \nEXAMPLE This query finds all movies that are not rated either G or PG-13: movies(query: { rated_nin: [\"G\", \"PG-13\"] }) {  title  year}  LOGICAL OPERATOR FIELDS \nA logical operator field allows you to define logical combinations of independent QueryInput objects. App Services generates root-level logical operator fields for all QueryInput types. A logical operator field evaluates to true for a given document if the evaluated result of all specified QueryInput objects satisfy the operator condition. Logical operator fields have the following form: <Operator>: [<QueryInput>, ...] \nOperator\nOperator Value Type\nDescription\nAND\n[QueryInput!] Finds documents that match all of the provided QueryInput objects. \nEXAMPLE This query finds all movies that are rated PG-13 and have a runtime of less than 120 minutes: query {  movies(query: { AND: [{ rated: \"PG-13\" }, { runtime_lt: 120 }] }) {    title    year  }} \nOR\n[QueryInput!] Finds documents that match any of the provided QueryInput objects. \nEXAMPLE This query finds all movies that are rated either G or PG-13: query {  movies(query: { OR: [{ rated: \"G\" }, { rated: \"PG-13\" }] }) {    title    year  }}  ELEMENT OPERATOR FIELDS \nAn element operator field allows you to define a boolean condition that describes a field in the document. App Services generates a set of element operator fields for every field in the document type. An element operator field evaluates to true for a given document if the result of evaluating the operator condition on the field in the document matches the specified boolean value. Element operator fields have the following form: <Field Name>_<Operator>: <Operator Value> \nOperator\nSupported Types\nOperator Value Type\nDescription\nexists\nAvailable for all types\nBoolean Finds documents where the field is not null. \nEXAMPLE This query finds all movies that do not have a value defined for the year field: query {  movies(query: { year_exists: false }) {    _id    title  }}  \nINSERTINPUT \nAn InsertInput object defines a document to insert into a collection. The document must conform to the GraphQL document type and include all required fields. \nEXAMPLE The following mutation includes an InsertInput with several fields that are all defined in the Movie document type. The Movie type requires all documents to have a title field, so the InsertInput must include one. The mutation inserts a new movie named \"My Fake Film\". insertOneMovie(input: {  title: \"My Fake Film\",  rated: \"UNRATED\",  year: 2020}) {  title}  \nUPDATEINPUT \nAn UpdateInput object defines a new value for one or more fields in a document. The updated document includes the new field values. Any fields that you do not specify remain unchanged. The updated values must conform to the GraphQL document type. \nEXAMPLE The following mutation includes an UpdateInput that sets the title field to \"My Super Real Film\". updateOneMovie(  query: { title: \"My Fake Film\" }  set: { title: \"My Super Real Film\" }) {  title}  \nRELATIONINPUT \nA RelationInput defines a new set of related documents for a relationship field in the mutated document. You can reference documents that already exist in the related collection with the link field or insert new documents into the related collection with the create field. You cannot use both link and create at the same time. If both are specified, the create operation takes precedence and the link is ignored. type RelationInput {  link: [ObjectId]  create: [InsertInput]}  \nEXAMPLE The following mutation includes an UpdateInput that modifies the reviews field. The field contains an array of _id values for documents in a separate reviews collection for to the field has a defined relationship.

 \nSORTBYINPUT \nA SortByInput enum defines a sort order for documents returned by a query. You can sort in ascending and descending order by any root-level field that does not have a type of object or array. The GraphQL API does not support nested sorts. App Services generates two sort enum values for each field. Each value is a fully-capitalized identifier that combines the field name and the sort direction, either ASC or DESC. \nEXAMPLE The following query returns movies sorted by the year they were released with the most recent movies listed first. movies(sortBy: YEAR_DESC) {  title}  \nQUERY RESOLVERS \nApp Services generates two GraphQL queries for each collection:  * A singular query that finds a specific document in the collection.  * A plural query that finds all documents in the collection. You can filter a plural query to include only the subset of documents in a collection that match a QueryInput. \nFIND A SINGLE DOCUMENT \nThe single document query field uses the same name as the data type that the collection contains. It returns a single document of the queried type and accepts the following parameters: Parameter\nType\nDescription\nquery\nQueryInput Optional. An object that defines a filter for documents in the collection. The object may specify one or more fields from the data type and must include a value for each field. The query matches all documents that include the specified field values. If you do not specify a query parameter then the query operation matches all documents. query {  movie(query: { title: \"The Matrix\" }) {    title    year    runtime    director  }}  \nFIND MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS \nThe multiple document query field uses the same name as the data type that the collection contains but has an additional \"s\" appended to the type name. It returns an array of documents of the queried type and accepts the following parameters: Parameter\nGraphQL Type\nDescription\nquery\nQueryInput Optional. An object that defines a filter for documents in the collection. The object may specify one or more fields from the data type and must include a value for each field. The query matches all documents that include the specified field values. If you do not specify a query argument then the query operation matches all documents. limit\nInt\nOptional. Default 100. The maximum number of documents to include in the query result set. If the query matches more than the set limit then it only returns a subset of matched documents.\nsortBy\nSortByInput Optional. A value that defines a sort order for documents in the query result set. You can sort in ascending and descending order by any root-level field that does not have a type of object or array. The sortBy value is a fully-capitalized identifier that combines the field name and the sort direction. For example:  * to sort by title from A to Z you would use TITLE_ASC  * to sort by rating from highest to lowest you would use RATING_DESC If you do not specify a sortBy argument then the query operation does not guarantee the order of documents in the result set. query {  movies(    query: { year: 2000 }    limit: 100    sortBy: TITLE_ASC  ) {    title    year    runtime    director  }}  \nMUTATION RESOLVERS \nApp Services generates a set of mutations for the documents in each collection. These allow you insert, modify, and delete one or more documents. \nINSERT A SINGLE DOCUMENT \nThe single document insert mutation field uses the name insertOne<Type> where <Type> is the singular name of the data type that the collection contains. It returns the inserted document and accepts the following parameters: Parameter\nType\nDescription\ndata\nInsertInput!\nRequired. A document to insert into the collection. If the collection schema marks a field as required then this document must include a valid value for that field. App Services automatically converts GraphQL types in the InsertInput object into their respective BSON type. mutation {  insertOneMovie(data: {    title: \"Little Women\"    director: \"Greta Gerwig\"    year: 2019    runtime: 135  }) {    _id    title  }}  \nINSERT MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS \nThe multiple document insert mutation field uses the name insertMany<Type>s where <Type> is the singular name of the data type that the collection contains.

App Services automatically converts GraphQL types in the UpdateInput object into their respective BSON type. mutation {  updateManyMovies(    query: { director: \"Tommy Wiseau\" }    set: { director: \"Tom Wiseau\" }  ) {    matchedCount    modifiedCount  }}  \nUPSERT A SINGLE DOCUMENT \nThe single document upsert mutation field uses the name upsertOne<Type> where <Type> is the singular name of the data type that the collection contains. This resolver updates a document that matches the query parameter and inserts a new document if none match the query. It returns the upserted document and accepts the following parameters: Parameter\nType\nDescription\nquery\nQueryInput Optional. An object that configures which document to update. The object may specify one or more fields from the data type and must include a value for each field. The query matches all documents that include the specified field values. If you do not specify a query argument or no documents match, then the mutation inserts the document specified in the data parameter. data\nInsertInput!\nRequired. The document to insert if the query does not match any existing documents. If the query does match a document replaces the queried document. If the collection schema marks a field as required then this document must include a valid value for that field. App Services automatically converts GraphQL types in the InsertInput object into their respective BSON type. mutation {  upsertOneMovie(    query: { title: \"Blacksmith Scene\" }    data: {

Type\n * Define the Input Type\n * Define the Payload Type\n * Define the Resolver Function\n * Save and Deploy the Resolver\n * Custom Resolver Examples\n * Scenario & Schemas\n * Custom Query Resolver\n * Custom Mutation\n * Computed Properties \nOVERVIEW \nYou can define custom resolvers that extend the GraphQL API for your app's use cases. Custom resolvers allow you to define new root-level operations that are more complex or specific than the generated query and mutation resolvers. You can also add new computed fields to generated document types that dynamically evaluate a result whenever an operation reads a document of the extended type. \nPROCEDURE \n1 \nCREATE A NEW CUSTOM RESOLVER \nIn the App Services UI, click GraphQL in the navigation sidebar and then select the Custom Resolvers tab. Click the Add a Custom Resolver button to open the configuration screen for a new custom resolver. \n2 \nDEFINE THE RESOLVER FIELD NAME \nSpecify App Servicese name for the resolver in the GraphQL Field Name input. App Services exposes the custom resolver in its parent type using this name, so the name should describe what the resolver does in a way that is useful to developers who work with the GraphQL API. \n3 \nDEFINE THE PARENT TYPE \nApp Services exposes every custom resolver as a field on a parent type. The parent type can be a root-level query, mutation, or a generated document type. In the Parent Type dropdown, select one of the following options: Option\nDescription\nQuery The resolver is a root-level query operation: \nEXAMPLE A custom resolver for a query named myCustomQuery has the following generated schema: type Query {  myCustomQuery: DefaultPayload  ...} \nMutation The resolver is a root-level mutation operation: \nEXAMPLE A custom resolver for a mutation named myCustomMutation has the following generated schema: type Mutation {  myCustomMutation: DefaultPayload  ...} \nDocument Type The resolver is a computed property on the specified document type. Any query or mutation that returns the document type can also ask for computed properties defined by custom resolvers on the type. \nEXAMPLE A custom resolver that defines a computed property on the Task type named myCustomTaskProperty has the following generated schema: type Task {  myCustomTaskProperty: DefaultPayload  ...}  4 \nDEFINE THE INPUT TYPE \nA custom resolver can accept input parameters from the incoming query or mutation. You can use an existing generated input type or define a new custom input type specifically for the resolver. If you specify an input type, App Services exposes the input parameter in the custom resolver's generated GraphQL schema definition as an optional parameter that accepts the specified input type. If you don't specify an input type, the custom resolver does not accept any arguments. In the Input Type dropdown, select one of the following options: Option\nDescription\nNone The resolver does not accept any input.  \nEXAMPLE A custom resolver named myCustomQuery that does not accept an input has the following generated schema: type Query {  myCustomQuery: DefaultPayload  ...} \nScalar The resolver uses an existing scalar type from the generated GraphQL schema. In the second dropdown input, select either a single scalar or an array of multiple scalars of the same type.  \nEXAMPLE A custom resolver named myCustomQuery that uses the Scalar Type option to specify an input type of DateTiem has the following generated schema: type Query {  myCustomQuery(input: DateTime): DefaultPayload  ...} \nExisting Type The resolver uses an existing input type from the generated GraphQL schema. In the second dropdown input, select either a single input object or an array of multiple input objects of the same type.  \nEXAMPLE A custom resolver named myCustomQuery that uses the Existing Type option to specify an input type of TaskInsertInput has the following generated schema: type Query {  myCustomQuery(input: TaskInsertInput): DefaultPayload  ...} \nCustom Type App Services generates a new input type specifically for the resolver based on a schema that you define.

input MyCustomQueryInput {  someArgument: String;}type Query {  myCustomQuery(input: MyCustomQueryInput): DefaultPayload  ...}  5 \nDEFINE THE PAYLOAD TYPE \nAll GraphQL resolvers must return a payload that conforms to a specific type in the schema. For a custom resolver, you can use an existing generated document type, define a new custom payload type specifically for the resolver, or use a default payload. App Services includes the specified payload type in the custom resolver's generated GraphQL schema definition. In the Payload Type dropdown, select one of the following options: Option\nDescription\nDefaultPayload The resolver returns the automatically generated DefaultPayload type which has the following signature: type DefaultPayload {  status: String!}  The status field will always resolve to \"complete\" regardless of the resolver function's return value. {  status: \"complete\"}   EXAMPLE A custom resolver named myCustomQuery that uses the DefaultPayload option has the following generated schema: type Query {  myCustomQuery: DefaultPayload  ...} \nScalar The resolver uses an existing scalar type from the generated GraphQL schema. In the second dropdown input, select either a single scalar or an array of multiple scalars of the same type.  \nEXAMPLE A custom resolver named myCustomQuery that uses the Scalar Type option to specify a payload type of DateTime has the following generated schema: type Query {  myCustomQuery: DateTime  ...} \nExisting Type The resolver returns an existing document type from the generated GraphQL schema. In the second dropdown input, select either a single document type or an array of multiple documents of the same type.  \nEXAMPLE A custom resolver named myCustomQuery that uses the Existing Type option to specify an input type of TaskInsertInput has the following generated schema: A custom resolver named myCustomQuery that uses the Existing Type option to specify a payload type of [Task] has the following generated schema: type Query {  myCustomQuery: [Task]  ...} \nCustom Type App Services generates a new payload type specifically for the resolver based on a schema that you define. The schema must be an object that contains at least one property and a title field that defines a unique name for the generated input type.  \nEXAMPLE A custom resolver named myCustomQuery that uses the Custom Type option with a payload type named MyCustomQueryPayload has the following generated schema: input MyCustomQueryPayload {  someValue: String;}type Query {  myCustomQuery: MyCustomQueryPayload  ...}  6 \nDEFINE THE RESOLVER FUNCTION \nWhen a user calls a custom resolver App Services executes the resolver function and returns the result, which must conform to the resolver's Payload Type. App Services passes the function any input data from the operation, if applicable. If the resolver is a computed property on a document type, App Services passes the function the specific document that the resolver was called on. A custom resolver function has one of two possible signatures, depending on whether or not it accepts an input:  \nTo define the resolver function, click the Function dropdown and either select an existing function or create a new one. \n7 \nSAVE AND DEPLOY THE RESOLVER \nOnce you have configured the resolver, click Save and deploy your application. Once deployed, you can call the custom resolver through the GraphQL API. \nCUSTOM RESOLVER EXAMPLES  SCENARIO & SCHEMAS \nConsider a hypothetical dashboard that a sales team uses to show various statistics and other performance metrics for a given time period. The dashboard uses the custom resolvers in this section to handle some of its specific use cases. The resolvers all reference Sale documents, which have the following schema:   CUSTOM QUERY RESOLVER \nThe sales team's hypothetical dashboard uses a custom query resolver that returns aggregated sales data for a specific month. App Services generates schema definitions for the resolver's custom input and payload types and adds the resolver to its parent type, the root-level Query: type Query {  averageSaleForMonth(input: AverageSaleForMonthInput): AverageSaleForMonthPayload}\ninput AverageSalesForMonthInput {  month: String!;  year: String!;}\ntype AverageSaleForMonthPayload {  month: String!;  year: String!;  averageSale: Float!;}  CONFIGURATION \nThe resolver uses the following configuration: Option\nDescription\nParent Type\nQuery\nGraphQL Field Name\naverageSaleForMonth\nInput Type Custom Type:

GetAverageSaleForMonth($averageSaleInput: AverageSaleForMonthInput!) {  averageSaleForMonth(input: $averageSaleInput) {    month    year    averageSale  }}  {  \"variables\": {    \"averageSaleInput\": { month: \"March\", year: \"2020\" }  }}  \nCUSTOM MUTATION \nThe sales team's hypothetical dashboard uses a custom mutation resolver that adds a string note to a specific Sale document, identified by its _id. App Services generates schema definitions for the resolver's custom input type and adds the resolver to its parent type, the root-level Mutation: type Mutation {  addNoteToSale(input: AddNoteToSaleInput): Sale}\ninput AddNoteToSaleInput {  sale_id: ObjectId!;  note: String!;}  CONFIGURATION \nThe resolver uses the following configuration: Option\nDescription\nParent Type\nMutation\nGraphQL Field Name\naddNoteToSale\nInput Type Custom Type: AddNoteToSaleInput  Payload Type Existing Type: Sale  Function exports = async function addNoteToSale({ sale_id, note }) {  const cluster = context.services.get(\"mongodb-atlas\");  const sales = cluster.db(\"corp\").collection(\"sales\");\n  const sale = await sales.findOneAndUpdate(    { _id: sale_id },    { $push: { notes: note } },    { returnNewDocument: true }  );  return sale;}  EXAMPLE USAGE \nTo call this custom query, you could use the following operation and variables: mutation AddNoteToSale($addNoteToSaleInput: AddNoteToSaleInput) {  addNoteToSale(input: $addNoteToSaleInput) {    _id    customer_id    month    year    saleTotal    notes  }}  {  \"variables\": {    \"addNoteToSaleInput\": {      \"sale_id\": \"5f3c2779796615b661fcdc25\",      \"note\": \"This was such a great sale!\"    }  }}  \nCOMPUTED PROPERTIES \nThe sales team's hypothetical dashboard uses a custom resolver that adds a new computed property to each Sale document. When an operation requests the computed field for a given Sale, the resolver queries an external system and returns support cases filed by the associated customer. App Services generates schema definitions for the resolver's custom payload type and adds the resolver to its parent type, Sale: type Sale {  _id: ObjectId!  customer_id: String!  year: String!  month: String!  saleTotal: Float!  notes: [String]  customerSupportCases: [CustomerSupportCase]}\ntype CustomerSupportCase {  caseId: String!  description: String!}  CONFIGURATION \nThe resolver uses

programmatically manage your Apps. With realm-cli, you can create or update Apps from a local directory as well as export existing applications to a local directory. \nINSTALLATION \nRealm CLI is available on npm. To install version 1 of the Realm CLI on your system, ensure that you have Node.js installed and then run the following command in your shell: npm install -g mongodb-realm-cli@1.3.4  \nGENERAL OPTIONS  IMPORTANT \nCHECK YOUR CLI VERSION This page documents commands, arguments, and flags for version 1 of realm-cli. If you have a newer version of Realm CLI, run realm-cli --help for a list of updated commands and usage examples. To check your CLI version, use: realm-cli --version. The following options are available for all realm-cli commands: --config-path <File System Path> Optional. If included with realm-cli login, stores information about the authenticated session in a file at the specified path. Session information includes your MongoDB Cloud username, MongoDB Atlas programmatic API Key, and a session refresh token. If included with any other command, authenticates the request with the session saved at the specified path (if it exists) instead of the current CLI authentication state. \nWARNING Since the session configuration file contains your MongoDB Atlas programmatic API private key, you should avoid sharing this file unintentionally. --disable-color Optional. If specified, suppress all text color in realm-cli output. By default, some output such as errors and import diffs are colorized. Use this flag if you wish to prevent this behavior. --yes Optional.

All imports default to the merge strategy unless otherwise specified. \nMERGE \nrealm-cli import --strategy=merge  Under the merge strategy, entities in the application directory are added to the application non-destructively. Any existing entities in an application are left unchanged if they are not represented in the imported application directory. If an imported entity's id value matches the id of an existing entity, the existing entity will be updated to match the imported entity. App Services assigns system-generated id values to entities without id values before importing them as new entities. If an entity is imported with an id that does not match an existing entity, the import will fail. Importing an entity with a non-ObjectID id value causes an error. \nNOTE If an imported entity has an id field, the value must be an ObjectID or the merge will fail. \nEXAMPLE An existing application has three functions: { \"id\": <ObjectID 1>, \"name\": \"FunctionA\", ... }{ \"id\": <ObjectID 2>, \"name\": \"FunctionB\", ... }{ \"id\": <ObjectID 3>, \"name\": \"FunctionC\", ... } A local application directory is imported with the merge strategy.\nThe directory contains configuration files for the following functions: { \"id\": <ObjectID 1>, \"name\": \"FunctionA_Updated!\", ... }{ \"name\": \"FunctionD\", ... } After importing, the application has the following functions: { \"id\": <ObjectID 1>, \"name\": \"FunctionA_Updated!\" }{ \"id\": <ObjectID 2>, \"name\": \"FunctionB\", ... }{ \"id\": <ObjectID 3>, \"name\": \"FunctionC\", ... }{ \"id\": <ObjectID 4>, \"name\": \"FunctionD\", ... } FunctionA was updated based on its imported configuration file. FunctionB and FunctionC were not included in the imported application directory, so they remained unchanged after importing with the merge strategy. FunctionD was imported as a new entity and assigned a system-generated id value. \nREPLACE \nrealm-cli import --strategy=replace  Under the replace strategy, if an imported entity's id value matches the id of an existing entity, App Services replaces the existing entity with the imported entity. If an imported entity's id value does not match an existing entity, the import fails.

Examples\n * Find All Documents\n * Find Document by ID\n * Find By Date\n * Data Access Permissions\n * Define Permissions for Specific API Keys\n * Define Permissions for a Specific Collection The following examples demonstrate how to send requests to the Atlas Data API. \nSPECIFY BSON TYPES IN REQUESTS \nData API requests can specify BSON types that don't exist in JSON by instead using the EJSON data format in the request body. You can use EJSON to match BSON types in query filters or write BSON types in insert and update operations. To specify that a request body uses EJSON, set the Content-Type header: Content-Type: application/ejson  \nBINARY \nTo specify a binary value, use $binary with the value encoded in Base64 and a BSON subtype encoded as a two-character hexadecimal string: curl --request POST \\  'https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/<App ID>/endpoint/data/v1/action/insertOne' \\  --header 'Content-Type: application/ejson' \\  --header 'apiKey: <API Key>' \\  --data-raw '{      \"dataSource\": \"<cluster name>\",      \"database\": \"<database name>\",      \"collection\": \"<collection name>\",      \"document\": {        \"data\": {          \"$binary\": {            \"base64\": \"46d989eaf0bde5258029534bc2dc2089\",            \"subType\": \"05\"          }        }      }  }' \nDATE \nTo

empty query object: curl --request POST \\  'https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/<App ID>/endpoint/data/v1/action/find' \\  --header 'Content-Type: application/ejson' \\  --header 'apiKey: <API Key>' \\  --data-raw '{      \"dataSource\": \"<cluster name>\",      \"database\": \"<database name>\",      \"collection\": \"<collection name>\",      \"filter\": {}  }' \nFIND DOCUMENT BY ID \nMongoDB stores each document with a unique identifier in the _id field. For most apps, this is a BSON ObjectID value. You can match any ObjectID field, including a document using an EJSON $oid object: curl --request POST \\  'https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/<App ID>/endpoint/data/v1/action/find' \\  --header 'Content-Type: application/ejson' \\  --header 'apiKey: <API Key>' \\  --data-raw '{      \"dataSource\": \"<cluster name>\",      \"database\": \"<database name>\",      \"collection\": \"<collection name>\",      \"filter\": {        \"_id\": { \"$oid\": \"630e51b3f4cd7d9e606caab6\" }      }  }' \nFIND BY DATE \nYou can match documents on a specific date by matching an EJSON $date object with a

The examples in this section demonstrate how to set up common permissions schemes. You can mix and match these and more complex schemes to meet your API's needs. For more examples and information on how permissions work, see Role-based Permissions. \nDEFINE PERMISSIONS FOR SPECIFIC API KEYS \nYou can define multiple roles with different data access permissions and assign specific API keys to each role. For example, you can create a read-only role that allows users to read all data but not insert, delete, or modify data. You map each role to an API key in the role's apply_when expression. Each API key corresponds to a separate user account with a unique account ID. You can access the account ID and other data of the user making a request with the %%user expansion. To associate a role with a single API key, set the apply_when expression to match the API key's account ID: apply_when - One user per role {  \"database\": \"<database>\",  \"collection\": \"<collection>\",  \"roles\": [    {       \"name\": \"SpecificUser\",       \"apply_when\": {         \"%%user.id\": \"61f9a5e69cd3c0199dc1bb88\"       },       \"insert\": true,       \"delete\": true,       \"read\": true,       \"write\": true    }  ],  \"filters\": []}  To associate a role with multiple API keys, set the apply_when expression to match an array of API key account IDs: apply_when - Multiple users per role {  \"database\": \"<database>\",  \"collection\": \"<collection>\",  \"roles\": [    {       \"name\": \"MultipleUsers\",       \"apply_when\": {         \"%%user.id\": {            \"$in\": [              \"61f9a5e69cd3c0199dc1bb88\",              \"61f9a5e69cd3c0199dc1bb89\"            ]         }       },       \"insert\": true,       \"delete\": true,       \"read\": true,       \"write\": true    }  ],  \"filters\": []}  You can also use a custom system to determine if a user has a role.

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nCUSTOM HTTPS ENDPOINTS \nOn this page    \n * Structure of an Endpoint\n   \n * Base URL\n * Endpoint Routes\n * HTTP Methods\n * Create a Custom HTTPS Endpoint\n * Authentication\n * Authorization\n * Write an Endpoint Function\n * Access Request Data\n * Return an HTTPS Response\n * Example\n * Call a Custom Endpoint\n * Choose a Response Data Format\n * Authenticate the Request\n * Authorize the Request You can define custom HTTPS endpoints to create app-specific API routes or webhooks that integrate with external services. A custom endpoint uses a serverless function that you write to handle incoming requests for a specific URL and HTTP method. Endpoints use standard, encrypted HTTPS requests, which means that you don't need to install any database drivers or opinionated libraries to call them. Instead, you send requests like this from any HTTP client: curl -X POST \\     -H 'apiKey: <API Key>' \\     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\     -H 'Accept: application/json' \\     -d '{ \"message\": \"Hello, world!\" }' \\     https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/myapp-abcde/endpoint/hello  \nSTRUCTURE OF AN ENDPOINT \nAn endpoint handles one or more HTTP methods sent to a specific URL. \nBASE URL \nEndpoints in an app share a base URL. The URL uses your App ID to uniquely point to your app. Globally deployed apps use the following format: Endpoint Base URL (Global Apps): https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/<App ID>/endpoint  Endpoints in a locally deployed app use a base URL specific to the app's deployment region (e.g. us-east-1) Endpoint Base URL (Local Apps) https://<Region>.aws.data.mongodb-api.com/app/<App ID>/endpoint  \nENDPOINT ROUTES \nEvery HTTPS endpoint has a route that serves as a name for the endpoint. An endpoint's route is arbitrary and specific to your app. However, it appears in the endpoint URL path and so should represent the action the route performs. Route names must begin with a forward slash (/) and may contain additional forward slashes to indicate a nested path. An endpoint route /my/nested/route  You call an endpoint by appending its route to your app's base URL and sending an HTTP request. An endpoint URL https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/<App ID>/endpoint/my/nested/route  \nHTTP METHODS \nEach endpoint in your app handles one or more HTTP methods for a given route. For example, you might have a single route that accepts POST requests to create a new resource and a GET request to list existing resources. You can define multiple custom endpoints that serve the same route but handle different request methods. Alternatively, you can define a single endpoint for the route that handles all methods. Custom endpoints support the following standard HTTP methods:      * GET  * POST  * PUT  * PATCH  * DELETE \nCREATE A CUSTOM HTTPS ENDPOINT \nYou can configure the Data API for your app from the App Services UI or by deploying configuration files with Realm CLI:   AUTHENTICATION \nCustom endpoints run in the context of a specific user, which allows your app to enforce rules and validate document schemas for each request. By default, endpoints use Application Authentication, which requires each request to include credentials for one of your application users, like an API key or JWT. You can also configure other custom authentication schemes to fit your application's needs. For examples of how to authenticate requests, see Authenticate Data API Requests.   TIP New endpoints that you create in the UI use System authentication by default. \nAUTHORIZATION \nAn endpoint can require authenticated users to provide additional authorization information in the request. You define the authorization scheme for each custom endpoint by configuring the endpoint function. Endpoints natively support a set of built-in authorization schemes that use a secret string to prove that the request is authorized. You can also define a custom authorization scheme that you can use together with or instead of the built-in schemes. To learn how to configure authorization for a specific function, see Define a Function.

Authorization expressions can use variables like %%user to authorize based on the calling user's data or %%request to make decisions based on the specifics of each incoming request. To define a custom authorization scheme, specify the expression in the endpoint function's configuration: http_endpoints/config.json [  {     ...,     \"can_evaluate\": {       \"%%request.headers.x-secret-key\": \"my-secret\"     }  }]  \nWRITE AN ENDPOINT FUNCTION \nEvery custom endpoint is associated with a function that runs whenever the endpoint receives an incoming request. In the function, you can import libraries from npm, connect to a linked MongoDB Atlas cluster, and call other serverless functions. To define a new function when creating an endpoint in the App Services UI, navigate to the Function section and select + New Function from the dropdown. Depending on your workflow, you can also define and edit endpoint handler functions:  * On the Functions page in the App Services UI.  * In the functions directory of your application using the App Services CLI.  * From your client using the Admin API. Endpoint functions always receive two arguments:  * A Request object that lets you access incoming request headers, query parameters, and body data.  * A Response object that you use to configure the HTTPS response sent back to the caller. For a sample function and an example request and response, see Example. \nACCESS REQUEST DATA \nA custom endpoint Request object represents the HTTP request that called the endpoint. You can access the incoming request's headers, query parameters, and body data. Endpoint Request Object {  \"headers\": { \"<Header>\": [\"<Header Value>\"] },  \"query\": { \"<Query Parameter>\": \"<Parameter Value>\" },  \"body\": <BSON.Binary>} \nField\nDescription\nquery An object where each field maps a URL query parameter to its value. If a key is used multiple times in the query string, only the first occurence is represented in this object. To work with the full query string, use context.request.rawQueryString. \nEXAMPLE The following query object represents the query string ?regions=na,eu&currency=USD: {  \"regions\": \"na&eu\",  \"currency\": \"USD\"} \nheaders An object where each field maps a request header name to an array of one or more values. \nEXAMPLE {  \"Content-Type\": [\"application/json\"],  \"Accept\": [\"application/json\"],  \"X-CustomHeader\": [\"some-value\", \"some-other-value\"]} \nbody A BSON.Binary object that contains the request body. If the request did not include a body, this value is undefined. To access data in the request body, you need to serialize the binary: // Convert the request body to a JSON stringconst serialized = request.body.text();// Parse the string into a usable objectconst body = JSON.parse(serialized);  \nRETURN AN HTTPS RESPONSE \nA custom endpoint Response object lets you configure the HTTPS response sent back to the caller. You can set the status code, customize headers, and include data in the response body. Method\nDescription\nsetStatusCode(code)\n- code: number Set the HTTP response status code. \nEXAMPLE response.setStatusCode(201); \nsetBody(body)\n- body: string | BSON.Binary Set the HTTP response body. If body is a string, the endpoint automatically encodes it as a BSON.Binary. \nEXAMPLE response.setBody(  \"{'message': 'Hello, World!'}\"); \nsetHeader(name, value)\n- name: string\n- value: string Set the HTTP response header specified by name to the value passed in the value argument. This overrides any other values that may have already been assigned to that header. \nEXAMPLE response.setHeader(  \"Content-Type\",  \"application/json\"); \naddHeader(name, value)\n- name: string\n- value: string Set the HTTP response header specified by name to the value passed in the value argument. Unlike setHeader, this does not override other values that have already been assigned to the header. \nEXAMPLE response.addHeader(  \"Cache-Control\",  \"max-age=600\");\nresponse.addHeader(  \"Cache-Control\",  \"min-fresh=60\")  \nEXAMPLE \nConsider an endpoint function that parses the body of an incoming POST request, stores the parsed body in a MongoDB collection, and then responds to

Docs Home → Atlas App Services \nAUTHENTICATE DATA API REQUESTS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Bearer Authentication\n * Credential Headers\n * Email/Password\n * API Key\n * Custom JWT \nOVERVIEW \nData API endpoints generally require that incoming requests include authentication information for the user calling the endpoint. This lets the endpoint enforce rules and validate document schemas for each request. Requests must include authentication data in specific request headers. App Services uses the following process to authenticate a given request:       1. Check for an Authorization header. If it's present, try to use Bearer Authentication. The header must contain a valid user access token. If the token is invalid, the request fails.  2. If the Authorization header is not present or does not use the \"Bearer\" scheme, check for Credential Headers. The headers must contain valid Email/Password, API Key, or Custom JWT credentials for an App user. \nNOTE You must enable an authentication provider before users can authenticate with it. \nBEARER AUTHENTICATION \nThe Data API supports Bearer Authentication, which lets you authenticate a request by including a valid user access token in the request's Authorization header. To learn how to get and manage an access token, see Manage User Sessions. The Authorization header uses the following format: Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>  For example, the following request uses Bearer Authentication: curl -X POST 'https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/<AppID>/endpoint/data/v1/action/find' \\   --header 'Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>' \\   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\   --data-raw '{     \"dataSource\": \"mongodb-atlas\",     \"database\": \"sample_mflix\",     \"collection\": \"movies\",     \"filter\": {       \"title\": \"The Matrix\"     }   }'  In general, bearer authentication with an access token has higher throughput and is more secure than credential headers. Use an access token instead of credential headers when possible. The token lets you run multiple requests without re-authenticating the user. It also lets you send requests from a web browser that enforces CORS. \nIMPORTANT \nDON'T USE API KEYS IN USER-FACING CLIENTS If you're authenticating from a browser or another user-facing client application, avoid using an API key to log in. Instead, use another authentication provider that takes user-provided credentials. Never store API keys or other sensitive credentials locally. Bearer authentication is useful for:  * sending requests from a web browser.  * sending multiple requests without storing user credentials or prompting the user on each request.  * sending requests from an app that also uses a Realm SDK to authenticate users. \nCREDENTIAL HEADERS \nYou can authenticate a Data API request by including the user's login credentials in the request headers. The exact headers to include depend on the authentication provider. Credential headers are useful for:  * requests sent from a server-side application  * requests sent from a command-line tool  * manual or test requests sent from an HTTPS client like Postman \nIMPORTANT You cannot use credential headers to authenticate requests sent from a web browser due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing restrictions. Instead, to authenticate Data API requests from a browser, use Bearer Authentication. \nEMAIL/PASSWORD \nTo authenticate a Data API request as an email/password user, include the user's credentials in the request's email and password headers. curl -X POST 'https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/<AppID>/endpoint/data/v1/action/find' \\   --header 'email: <EmailAddress>' \\   --header 'password: <Password>' \\   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\   --data-raw '{     \"dataSource\": \"mongodb-atlas\",     \"database\": \"sample_mflix\",     \"collection\": \"movies\",     \"filter\":

using standard HTTPS requests. The API includes automatically generated endpoints that each represent a MongoDB operation. You can use the endpoints to create, read, update, delete, and aggregate documents in a MongoDB data source. For example, this POST request stores a document in a linked cluster by calling the insertOne endpoint: curl --request POST \\  'https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/myapp-abcde/endpoint/data/v1/action/insertOne' \\  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\  --header 'Accept: application/json' \\  --header 'apiKey: TpqAKQgvhZE4r6AOzpVydJ9a3tB1BLMrgDzLlBLbihKNDzSJWTAHMVbsMoIOpnM6' \\  --data-raw '{      \"dataSource\": \"mongodb-atlas\",      \"database\": \"learn-data-api\",      \"collection\": \"hello\",      \"document\": {        \"text\": \"Hello from the Data API!\",      }  }' HIDE OUTPUT { \"insertedId\": \"5f1a785e1536b6e6992fd588\" } \nWHEN TO USE THE DATA API \nYou can use the Data API to integrate with any app or service that supports HTTPS requests. For example, you might:      * call the API from a serverless edge function  * query Atlas from a mobile application  * access test data and log events in a CI/CD workflow  * integrate Atlas into a federated API gateway  * connect from an environment not currently supported via a MongoDB Driver or Realm SDK An operation called through an API endpoint will likely take longer than the corresponding MongoDB operation called through a connected MongoDB Driver. For high-load use-cases and latency sensitive applications, we recommend connecting directly to your database with a MongoDB driver. To learn more, visit the MongoDB Drivers documentation. \nBASE URL \nThe Data API endpoints in an app share a base URL. The URL uses your App ID to uniquely point to your app and specifies which version of the Data API to call. Each endpoint has a unique URL formed by appending the endpoint's route to your app's base URL. Globally deployed apps use the following format: Endpoint Base URL (Global Apps): https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/<App ID>/endpoint/data/<API Version>  Endpoints in a locally deployed app use a base URL specific to the app's deployment region (e.g. us-east-1.aws): Endpoint Base URL (Local Apps) https://<Region>.<Cloud>.data.mongodb-api.com/app/<App ID>/endpoint/data/<API Version>  \nSET UP THE DATA API \nYou can configure the Data API for your app from the App Services UI or by deploying configuration files with Realm CLI:   AUTHENTICATION \nData API endpoints run in the context of a specific user, which allows your app to enforce rules and validate document schemas for each request. By default, endpoints use Application Authentication, which requires each request to include credentials for one of your application users, like an API key or JWT. You can also configure other custom authentication schemes to fit your application's needs. For examples of how to authenticate requests, see Authenticate Data API Requests.   AUTHORIZATION \nYou can require authenticated users to provide additional authorization information in each request.

BUILT-IN AUTHORIZATION SCHEMES \nEndpoints support the following built-in authorization schemes:  \nCUSTOM AUTHORIZATION SCHEMES \nYou can define a custom authorization expression to determine if an incoming authenticated request is allowed to run. The expression is evaluated for each request and must evaluate to true to allow the request. If the expression evaluates to false, the request is not authorized and fails with an error. Requests that fail authorization are not counted toward your App's billed usage. Authorization expressions can use variables like %%user to authorize based on the calling user's data or %%request to make decisions based on the specifics of each incoming request. To define a custom authorization scheme, specify the expression in your app's Data API configuration: http_endpoints/data_api_config.json {  ...,  \"can_evaluate\": {    \"%%request.headers.x-secret-key\": \"my-secret\"  }}  \nRESPONSE TYPE \nEndpoints can return data in one of two data formats, either JSON or EJSON. By default, endpoints return JSON, which is a standard data format that is widely supported modern langauges and platforms. However, JSON cannot represent every data type that you can store in MongoDB and loses type information for some data types. You can also configure endpoints to return EJSON, which uses structured JSON objects to fully represent the types that MongoDB supports. This preserves type information in responses but requires that your application understands how to parse and use EJSON. \nTIP The official MongoDB drivers include methods for working with EJSON. You can also download a standalone parser like bson on npm.   ACCESS PERMISSIONS \nThe Data API uses your app's data access rules to determine if a user can read and write data. To allow Data API requests to access a specific collection, you must first define rules for the collection. You can also set up an IP Access List for additional security. \nAPI VERSIONS \nThe Data API uses a built-in versioning scheme to upgrade endpoints over time while maintaining backwards compatibility. Incoming requests can specify which version of an endpoint to use in the request URL and the Data API can serve any version that you have enabled. You must enable a new version before users can call endpoints with that version. You can always enable the most recent Data API version. However, you cannot enable an older version after a newer version has been released. The following versions are currently supported:  * beta  * v1 \nCALL A DATA API ENDPOINT \nYou can call a Data API endpoint from any standard HTTP client. Each request can include configuration headers and arguments in the request body. \nCHOOSE AN API VERSION \nData API requests specify which version of the API to use in the request URL. A request can specify any version that is enabled for your app. https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/<App ID>/endpoint/data/<API Version>  \nSPECIFY THE REQUEST DATA FORMAT \nData API requests must include a Content-Type header to specify the data format used in the request body.  * Use Content-Type: application/json to represent standard JSON types in a Data API request body.  * Use Content-Type: application/ejson to represent standard JSON types and additional EJSON types in a Data API request body.   CHOOSE A RESPONSE DATA FORMAT \nA request can include an Accept header to request a specific data format for the response body, either JSON or EJSON. If a request does not include a valid Accept header, the response uses the data format specified in your Data API configuration.   AUTHENTICATE THE REQUEST \nIf an endpoint is configured to use Application Authentication then you must include a valid user access token or login credentials with every request. In general, bearer authentication with an access token has higher throughput and is more secure than credential headers. Use an access token instead of credential headers when possible. The token lets you run multiple requests without re-authenticating the user. It also lets you send requests from a web browser that enforces CORS. To use an access token, first authenticate the user through an App Services authentication provider. Then, get the access token returned from App Services and include it in the request's Authorization header using a Bearer token scheme.
