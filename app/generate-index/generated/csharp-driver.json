operations. Each example provides the following information:      * A code snippet that shows how to perform the operation in synchronous and asynchronous frameworks  * A link to a fully runnable console application using the operation  * The expected result after running the example \nHOW TO USE THE USAGE EXAMPLES \nThese examples use the sample datasets provided by Atlas. You can load them into your database on the free tier of MongoDB Atlas by following the Get Started with Atlas Guide or you can import the sample dataset into a local MongoDB instance. Once you have imported the dataset, you can copy and paste a usage example into your development environment of choice. You can follow the Quick Start to learn more about getting started with the MongoDB .NET/C# Driver. Once you've copied a usage example, you'll need to edit the connection URI to get the example connected to your MongoDB instance: // Replace the following with your MongoDB deployment's connection

Project\n * Add MongoDB as a Dependency\n * Query Your MongoDB Cluster from Your Application\n * Next steps This guide shows you how to create an application that uses the .NET/C# Driver to connect to a MongoDB Atlas cluster. If you prefer to connect to MongoDB using a different driver or programming language, see our list of official MongoDB drivers. The .NET/C# driver lets you connect to and communicate with MongoDB clusters from a .NET application. MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service that hosts your data on MongoDB clusters. In this guide, we show you how to get started with your own free (no credit card required) cluster. Follow the steps below to connect your .NET application with a MongoDB Atlas cluster. \nCREATE A MONGODB CLUSTER  SET UP A FREE TIER CLUSTER IN ATLAS \nTo set up your Atlas Free Tier Cluster required for this guide, complete the guide on MongoDB Atlas Setup. After completing the steps in the Atlas guide, you have a new MongoDB cluster deployed in Atlas, a new database user, and sample datasets loaded into your cluster. You also have a connection string similar to the following in your copy buffer: \"mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.abc.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority\"  \nSET YOUR CONNECTION STRING \nRun the following code at the command prompt to save your MongoDB connection string to an environment variable. This method is safer than including your credentials in your source code. export MONGODB_URI='<your MongoDB connection string>'  \nIMPORTANT Make sure to replace the <username> and <password> sections of the connection string with the username and password of your Atlas user. \nSET UP YOUR PROJECT  CREATE THE PROJECT \nCreate a new directory and initialize your project with the dotnet new command, as follows: mkdir csharp-quickstartcd csharp-quickstartdotnet new console  \nADD MONGODB AS A DEPENDENCY \nUse the dotnet add command to add the .NET/C# Driver to your project as a dependency. dotnet add package MongoDB.Driver  \nQUERY YOUR MONGODB CLUSTER FROM YOUR APPLICATION \nIn this step, you'll use the .NET/C# Driver to connect to your MongoDB cluster and run a query on the sample data. Open the file named Program.cs in the base directory of your project. Copy the following sample code into Program.cs using MongoDB.Driver;using MongoDB.Bson;\nvar connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MONGODB_URI\");if (connectionString == null){    Console.WriteLine(\"You must set your 'MONGODB_URI' environmental variable. See\\n\\t https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/usage-examples/#environment-variable\");    Environment.Exit(0);}\nvar client = new MongoClient(connectionString);\nvar collection = client.GetDatabase(\"sample_mflix\").GetCollection<BsonDocument>(\"movies\");\nvar filter = Builders<BsonDocument>.Filter.Eq(\"title\", \"Back to the Future\");\nvar document = collection.Find(filter).First();\nConsole.WriteLine(document);  This sample code runs a query against your sample dataset in MongoDB Atlas. Run it from your command line by using the following command: dotnet run csharp-quickstart.csproj  When you run Program.cs, it should output the details of the following movie from the sample dataset: {    \"_id\": \"573a1398f29313caabce9682\",    ...    \"title\": \"Back to the Future\",    ...}  \nTIP If your output is empty, ensure you have loaded the sample datasets into your cluster. After completing this step, you should have a working application that uses the .NET/C# Driver to connect to your MongoDB cluster, run a query on the sample data, and print out the result.

Docs Home → C#/.NET \nFAQ \nOn this page    \n * Why Does the Driver Throw a Timeout During Server Selection?\n   \n * Why is the Wait Queue for Acquiring a Connection to the Server Full?\n * Why are Certain LINQ or Builder Expressions Unsupported? \nWHY DOES THE DRIVER THROW A TIMEOUT DURING SERVER SELECTION? \nEach driver operation requires that you choose a healthy server satisfying the server selection criteria. If you do not select an appropriate server within the server selection timeout, the driver throws a server selection timeout exception. The exception looks similar to the following: A timeout occurred after 30000ms selecting a server using CompositeServerSelector{ Selectors = MongoDB.Driver.MongoClient+AreSessionsSupportedServerSelector, LatencyLimitingServerSelector{ AllowedLatencyRange = 00:00:00.0150000 }, OperationsCountServerSelector }.Client view of cluster state is{    ClusterId : \"1\",    Type : \"Unknown\",    State : \"Disconnected\",    Servers :    [{        ServerId: \"{ ClusterId : 1, EndPoint : \"Unspecified/localhost:27017\" }\",        EndPoint: \"Unspecified/localhost:27017\",        ReasonChanged: \"Heartbeat\",        State: \"Disconnected\",        ServerVersion: ,        TopologyVersion: ,        Type: \"Unknown\",        HeartbeatException: \"<exception details>\"    }]}.  The error message consists of multiple parts:       1. The server selection timeout (30000 ms).  2. The server selectors considered (CompositeServerSelector containing AreSessionsSupportedServerSelector, LatencyLimitingServerSelector, and OperationsCountServerSelector).  3. The driver’s current view of the cluster topology. The list of servers that the driver is aware of is a key part of this view. Each server description contains an exhaustive description of its current state including information about an endpoint, a server version, a server type, and its current health state. If the server is not heathy, HeartbeatException contains the exception from the last failed heartbeat. Analyzing the HeartbeatException on each cluster node can assist in diagnosing most server selection issues. The following heartbeat exceptions are common:\n    \n    * No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it: The driver cannot see this cluster node. This can be because the cluster node has crashed, a firewall is preventing network traffic from reaching the cluster node or port, or some other network error is preventing traffic from being successfully routed to the cluster node.\n    \n    * Attempted to read past the end of the stream: This error happens when the driver cannot connect to the cluster nodes due to a network error, misconfigured firewall, or other network issue. To address this exception, ensure that all cluster nodes are reachable. This error commonly occurs when the client machine’s IP address is not configured in the Atlas IPs Access List, which can be found under the Network Access tab for your Atlas Project.\n    \n    * The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure: This error typically indicates a TLS/SSL-related problem such as an expired/invalid certificate or an untrusted root CA. You can use tools like openssl s_client to debug TLS/SSL-related certificate problems. \nWHY IS THE WAIT QUEUE FOR ACQUIRING A CONNECTION TO THE SERVER FULL? \nThis exception usually indicates a threading or concurrency problem in your application. The driver checks out a connection from the selected server’s connection pool for every read or write operation. If the connection pool is already at maxPoolSize - 100 by default - then the requesting thread blocks in a wait queue. The wait queue's default size is 5 times maxPoolSize, or 500. If the wait queue is also full, the driver throws a MongoWaitQueueFullException. The exception looks similar to the following: MongoDB.Driver.MongoWaitQueueFullException: The wait queue foracquiring a connection to server myServer is full.  To resolve this issue, try the following steps:  1. Tune your indexes.

 3. Increase maxPoolSize to allow more simultaneous operations to a given cluster node. If your MongoDB cluster does not have sufficient resources to handle the additional connections and simultaneous workload, performance can decrease due to resource contention on the cluster nodes. Adjust this setting only with careful consideration and testing.  4. Increase waitQueueMultiple to allow more threads/tasks to block waiting for a connection. This is rarely the appropriate solution and can severely affect your application performance. Before considering changes to this setting, address the concurrency problems in your application. \nWHY ARE CERTAIN LINQ OR BUILDER EXPRESSIONS UNSUPPORTED? \nEach LINQ or Builder expression must be available in the Query API. This is not always possible for the following reasons:  1. You are attempting to use a .NET/C# feature that does not have an equivalent MongoDB representation. For example, .NET/C# and MongoDB have different semantics around collations.  2. The driver does not support a particular transformation from LINQ or Builder expression into MQL (MongoDB Query Language). This may happen because the provided query has no MQL translation or because a feature has not been implemented yet in the driver. If you receive an Unsupported filter ... or Expression not supported ... exception message, try the following steps:  1. Try configuring the new LINQ3 provider. The LINQ3 provider contains many fixes and new features over the LINQ2 provider.  2. Use the MongoDB Analyzer to analyze your expressions.  3. Try to simplify your query where possible.  4. Provide a query as a BsonDocument or JSON string. All driver definition classes such as FilterDefinition, ProjectionDefinition, and PipelineDefinition support implicit conversion from BsonDocument or JSON string. For example, the following filters are equivalent when used in a query or aggregation: FilterDefinition<Entity> typedFilter = Builders<Entity>.Filter.Eq(e => e.A, 1);FilterDefinition<Entity> bsonFilter = new BsonDocument {{ \"a\", 1 }};FilterDefinition<Entity> jsonFilter = \"{ a : 1 }\";  \nNOTE If you use BsonDocument or JSON string, then BsonClassMap, BSON serialization attributes, and serialization conventions are not taken into account in the Query API. Field names must match the names and casing as stored by the server. For example, when referencing the _id field, you must refer to it using _id in BsonDocument or JSON string definitions. Similarly, if a document has a field FirstName annotated with [BsonElement(\"first_name\")], you must refer to it as first_name in BsonDocument or JSON string definitions. You can combine the raw and typed forms in the same query, as the following code demonstrates: FilterDefinition<Entity> filter = Builders<Entity>.Filter    .And(Builders<Entity>.Filter        .Eq(e => e.A, 1), BsonDocument        .Parse(\"{ b : 2 }\")); \n←  Issues & Help On this page  * Why Does the Driver Throw a Timeout During Server Selection?\n * Why is the Wait Queue for Acquiring a Connection to the Server Full?\n * Why are Certain LINQ or Builder Expressions Unsupported?

Additional Information\n * API Documentation You can retrieve multiple documents from a collection by using the Find() method. \nEXAMPLES \nThe examples on this page use the following Restaurant, Address, and GradeEntry classes as models: public class Restaurant{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\")]    public string RestaurantId { get; set; }\n    public string Cuisine { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n    public string Borough { get; set; }\n    public List<GradeEntry> Grades { get; set; }}  public class Address{    public string Building { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"coord\")]    public double[] Coordinates { get; set; }\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"zipcode\")]    public string ZipCode { get; set; }}  public class GradeEntry{    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    public string Grade { get; set; }\n    public float Score { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the restaurants collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Restaurant class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. \nFIND DOCUMENTS USING BUILDERS \nThe following example uses Builders to find documents in the restaurants collection with the cuisine \"Pizza\". Select the Asynchronous or Synchronous tab to see the corresponding code.   FIND DOCUMENTS USING LINQ \nThe following example uses LINQ to find documents in the restaurants collection with the cuisine \"Pizza\". Select the Asynchronous or Synchronous tab to see the corresponding code.   FIND ALL DOCUMENTS \nThe following example finds all documents in the restaurants collection. Select the Asynchronous or Synchronous tab to see the corresponding code.   EXPECTED RESULT \nRunning the preceding full examples prints the following results: Finding documents with builders...:Number of documents found: 1163\nFinding documents with LINQ...:Number of documents found: 1163\nFinding all documents...:Number of documents found: 25359  \nTIP \nSAMPLE DATASETS These examples use the sample datasets provided by Atlas.

DeleteMany() synchronous method or the DeleteManyAsync() asynchronous method on a collection object. \nEXAMPLE \nThe examples on this page use the following Restaurant, Address, and GradeEntry classes as models: public class Restaurant{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\")]    public string RestaurantId { get; set; }\n    public string Cuisine { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n    public string Borough { get; set; }\n    public List<GradeEntry> Grades { get; set; }}  public class Address{    public string Building { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"coord\")]    public double[] Coordinates { get; set; }\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"zipcode\")]    public string ZipCode { get; set; }}  public class GradeEntry{    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    public string Grade { get; set; }\n    public float Score { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the restaurants collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Restaurant class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. The following code deletes all documents in the restaurants collection whose borough field value equals the word \"Brooklyn\". Select the Asynchronous or Synchronous tab to see the corresponding code.   EXPECTED RESULT \nRunning either of the preceding full examples prints the following results: Deleting documents...Deleted documents: 6086Resetting sample data...done.  \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nTo learn more about deleting documents, see the Delete Documents guide.

Documentation You can retrieve a document by using the Find() method on a collection object. \nEXAMPLES \nThe examples on this page use the following Restaurant, Address, and GradeEntry classes as models: public class Restaurant{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\")]    public string RestaurantId { get; set; }\n    public string Cuisine { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n    public string Borough { get; set; }\n    public List<GradeEntry> Grades { get; set; }}  public class Address{    public string Building { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"coord\")]    public double[] Coordinates { get; set; }\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"zipcode\")]    public string ZipCode { get; set; }}  public class GradeEntry{    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    public string Grade { get; set; }\n    public float Score { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the restaurants collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Restaurant class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. \nFIND A DOCUMENT USING BUILDERS \nThe following example uses Builders to find a document in the restaurants collection that has a name field with a value of \"Bagels N Buns\". Select the Asynchronous or Synchronous tab to see the corresponding code.

[2] .NET/C# Driver versions 2.14 or later requires .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later. [3] .NET/C# Driver versions 2.8 to 2.13 requires .NET Framework 4.5.2 or later. For more information on how to read the compatibility tables, see our guide on MongoDB Compatibility Tables. ←  LoggingWhat's New → On this page  * MongoDB Compatibility\n * Compatibility Table

Docs Home → C#/.NET \nUPDATE A DOCUMENT \nOn this page    \n * Examples\n   \n * Expected Result\n * More Information\n * API Documentation You can update a single document using the UpdateOne() method on a MongoCollection object. This method requires a query filter, which specifies which document to update, and an update statement, which specifies the changes the driver should make to the first document matching the query filter. \nNOTE The UpdateOne() method updates only the first document that matches the filter. To update more than one document, use the UpdateMany() method. \nTIP You can pass an instance of UpdateOptions to the UpdateOne() method in order to customize its behavior. \nEXAMPLES \nThe examples on this page use the following Restaurant, Address, and GradeEntry classes as models: public class Restaurant{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\")]    public string RestaurantId { get; set; }\n    public string Cuisine { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n    public string Borough { get; set; }\n    public List<GradeEntry> Grades { get; set; }}  public class Address{    public string Building { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"coord\")]    public double[] Coordinates { get; set; }\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"zipcode\")]    public string ZipCode { get; set; }}  public class GradeEntry{    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    public string Grade { get; set; }\n    public float Score { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the restaurants collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Restaurant class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. The following example uses Builders to update the name of the first document named \"Bagels N Buns\" in the restaurants collection to \"2 Bagels 2 Buns\".

collection by using the synchronous InsertMany() method or the asynchronous InsertManyAsync() method. \nEXAMPLES \nThe examples on this page use the following Restaurant, Address, and GradeEntry classes as models: public class Restaurant{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\")]    public string RestaurantId { get; set; }\n    public string Cuisine { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n    public string Borough { get; set; }\n    public List<GradeEntry> Grades { get; set; }}  public class Address{    public string Building { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"coord\")]    public double[] Coordinates { get; set; }\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"zipcode\")]    public string ZipCode { get; set; }}  public class GradeEntry{    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    public string Grade { get; set; }\n    public float Score { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the restaurants collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Restaurant class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. The following example inserts multiple documents into the restaurants collection. Select the Asynchronous or Synchronous tab to see the corresponding code.   EXPECTED RESULT \nAfter running either of the preceding full examples, the output is as follows: Number of restaurants found before insert: 0\nInserting documents...Number of restaurants inserted: 5

UpdateMany() method on a collection object. \nEXAMPLE \nThe examples on this page use the following Restaurant, Address, and GradeEntry classes as models: public class Restaurant{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\")]    public string RestaurantId { get; set; }\n    public string Cuisine { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n    public string Borough { get; set; }\n    public List<GradeEntry> Grades { get; set; }}  public class Address{    public string Building { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"coord\")]    public double[] Coordinates { get; set; }\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"zipcode\")]    public string ZipCode { get; set; }}  public class GradeEntry{    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    public string Grade { get; set; }\n    public float Score { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the restaurants collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Restaurant class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. The following code updates all documents in the restaurants collection that have a cuisine field with the value of \"Pizza\". After the update, these documents will have a cuisine field with a value of \"Pasta and breadsticks\". Select the Asynchronous or Synchronous tab to see the corresponding code.

Docs Home → C#/.NET \nREPLACE A DOCUMENT \nOn this page    \n * Example\n   \n * Expected Result\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation You can replace one document with another by using the ReplaceOne() synchronous method or the ReplaceOneAsync() asynchronous method on a collection object. \nEXAMPLE \nThe examples on this page use the following Restaurant, Address, and GradeEntry classes as models: public class Restaurant{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\")]    public string RestaurantId { get; set; }\n    public string Cuisine { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n    public string Borough { get; set; }\n    public List<GradeEntry> Grades { get; set; }}  public class Address{    public string Building { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"coord\")]    public double[] Coordinates { get; set; }\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"zipcode\")]    public string ZipCode { get; set; }}  public class GradeEntry{    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    public string Grade { get; set; }\n    public float Score { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the restaurants collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Restaurant class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. The following code replaces the first document in the restaurants collection that has a value of \"Pizza\" in the cuisine field. After the replacement, this document will have a name field with a value of \"Mongo's Pizza\" and new values for the address and borough fields. Select the Asynchronous or Synchronous tab to see the corresponding code.

Docs Home → C#/.NET \nINSERT A DOCUMENT \nOn this page    \n * Examples\n   \n * Expected Result\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation You can insert a single document into a collection by using the synchronous InsertOne() method, or the asynchronous InsertOneAsync() method. \nEXAMPLES \nThe examples on this page use the following Restaurant, Address, and GradeEntry classes as models: public class Restaurant{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\")]    public string RestaurantId { get; set; }\n    public string Cuisine { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n    public string Borough { get; set; }\n    public List<GradeEntry> Grades { get; set; }}  public class Address{    public string Building { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"coord\")]    public double[] Coordinates { get; set; }\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"zipcode\")]    public string ZipCode { get; set; }}  public class GradeEntry{    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    public string Grade { get; set; }\n    public float Score { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the restaurants collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Restaurant class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. The following example inserts a document into the restaurants collection. Select the Asynchronous or Synchronous tab to see the corresponding code.   EXPECTED RESULT \nAfter running either of the preceding full examples, the InsertOne() method inserts the document, and the Find() method returns the newly inserted document.

Docs Home → C#/.NET \nDELETE A DOCUMENT \nOn this page    \n * Examples\n   \n * Delete a Document Using Builders\n * Expected Result\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation You can delete a document from a collection by using the synchronous DeleteOne() method, or the asynchronous DeleteOneAsync() method. \nNOTE The DeleteOne() method deletes only the first document that matches the filter. To delete more than one document, use the DeleteMany() method. To learn more about using DeleteMany(), see Delete Many Documents. \nEXAMPLES \nThe examples on this page use the following Restaurant, Address, and GradeEntry classes as models: public class Restaurant{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\")]    public string RestaurantId { get; set; }\n    public string Cuisine { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n    public string Borough { get; set; }\n    public List<GradeEntry> Grades { get; set; }}  public class Address{    public string Building { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"coord\")]    public double[] Coordinates { get; set; }\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"zipcode\")]    public string ZipCode { get; set; }}  public class GradeEntry{    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    public string Grade { get; set; }\n    public float Score { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the restaurants collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Restaurant class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. \nDELETE A DOCUMENT USING BUILDERS \nThe following example uses Builders to delete a document in the restaurants collection with the name \"Ready Penny Inn\".

Docs Home → C#/.NET \nLOGGING \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Configure Logging\n * Log Messages by Category\n * Configure Log Verbosity \nOVERVIEW \nStarting in version 2.18, the .NET/C# Driver uses the standard .NET logging API. In this guide, you can learn how to use the driver to configure logging for your application. \nCONFIGURE LOGGING \nTo specify the logging settings for your application, create a new instance of the LoggingSettings class, then assign it to the LoggingSettings property of your MongoClientSettings object. The LoggingSettings constructor accepts the following parameters: Property\nDescription\nLoggerFactory\nThe ILoggerFactory object that creates an ILogger. You can create an ILoggerFactory object by using the LoggerFactory.Create() method. \nData Type: ILoggerFactory\nDefault: null\nMaxDocumentSize\nOptional. The maximum number of characters for extended JSON documents in logged messages. \nFor example, when the driver logs the CommandStarted message, it truncates the Command field to the number of characters specified in this parameter. \nData Type: integer\nDefault: 1000 The following code sample shows how to create a MongoClient that logs all debug messages to the console: using var loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(b =>{  b.AddSimpleConsole();  b.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug);});\nvar settings = MongoClientSettings.FromConnectionString(\"<your connection string>\");settings.LoggingSettings = new LoggingSettings(loggerFactory);var client = new MongoClient(settings);  \nLOG MESSAGES BY CATEGORY \nEach message generated by a MongoDB cluster is assigned a category. This lets you specify different log levels for different types of messages. MongoDB uses the following categories to classify messages: Category\nDescription\nMongoDB.Command\nThe progress of commands run against your cluster, represented by CommandStartedEvent, CommandSucceededEvent, and CommandFailedEvent\nMongoDB.SDAM\nChanges in the topology of the cluster, including ClusterAddedServerEvent, ClusterRemovedServerEvent, ServerHeartbeatStartedEvent, ClusterDescriptionChangedEvent, and ServerDescriptionChangedEvent\nMongoDB.ServerSelection\nThe decisions that determine which server to send a particular command to\nMongoDB.Connection\nChanges in the cluster connection pool, including ConnectionPoolReadyEvent, ConnectionPoolClosedEvent, ConnectionCreatedEvent, and ConnectionCheckoutEvent\nMongoDB.Internal.*\nPrefix for all other .NET/C# Driver internal components \nTIP You can specify the minimum verbosity for all logging categories by configuring the Default category. \nCONFIGURE LOG VERBOSITY \nYou can configure the log verbosity of each message category by using the standard .NET logging mechanism. The following code sample shows how to configure a MongoClient to log two types of messages:      * All messages with log level Error or higher from all categories  * All messages with log level Debug or higher from the SDAM category In this example, the configuration is done in-memory. The code creates a Dictionary<string, string> where the key is \"LogLevel:<category>\" and the value is the minimum log level of messages in that category. The code then adds the dictionary to a ConfigurationBuilder object, then adds the ConfigurationBuilder to a LoggerFactory. var categoriesConfiguration = new Dictionary<string, string>{  { \"LogLevel:Default\", \"Error\" },  { \"LogLevel:MongoDB.SDAM\", \"Debug\" }};\nvar config = new ConfigurationBuilder()  .AddInMemoryCollection(categoriesConfiguration)  .Build();\nusing var loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(b =>{  b.AddConfiguration(config);  b.AddSimpleConsole();});\nvar settings = MongoClientSettings.FromConnectionString(\"<your connection string>\");settings.LoggingSettings = new LoggingSettings(loggerFactory);var client = new MongoClient(settings);  \nTIP For more information on configuring log verbosity, see the Microsoft .NET

API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to authenticate with MongoDB using the authentication mechanisms available in the MongoDB Community Edition. Authentication mechanisms are processes by which the driver and server confirm the identity of a client to ensure security before connecting. You can use the following authentication mechanisms with the latest version of MongoDB Community Edition:      * SCRAM-SHA-256  * SCRAM-SHA-1  * X.509 To authenticate using GSSAPI/Kerberos or LDAP, see the Enterprise Authentication Mechanisms fundamentals page. For more information on establishing a connection to your MongoDB cluster, see the Connection Guide. \nSPECIFY AN AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM \nYou can specify your authentication mechanism and credentials when connecting to MongoDB using either of the following methods:  * A connection string, also known as a connection URI, which is a string that tells the driver how to connect to a MongoDB deployment and how to behave while connected.  * A factory method for the supported authentication mechanism, contained in the MongoCredential class. \nMECHANISMS \nThe following examples specify authentication mechanisms using the following placeholders:  * <username>: Your MongoDB username.  * <password>: Your MongoDB user's password.  * <hostname>: The network address of your MongoDB server, accessible by your client.  * <port>: The port number of your MongoDB server.  * <authenticationDb>: The MongoDB database that contains your user's authentication data. If you omit this parameter, the driver uses the default value admin. \nDEFAULT \nThe default authentication mechanism setting uses one of the following authentication mechanisms, depending on which MongoDB versions your server supports:  * SCRAM-SHA-256  * SCRAM-SHA-1  * MONGODB-CR \nNOTE MongoDB version 4.0 uses SCRAM as the default mechanism, and no longer supports MONGODB-CR. Select the Connection String or MongoCredential tab to see the corresponding syntax for specifying the default authentication mechanism:   SCRAM-SHA-256 \nSCRAM-SHA-256 is a salted challenge-response authentication mechanism (SCRAM) that uses your username and password, encrypted with the SHA-256 algorithm, to authenticate your user. You can specify the SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication mechanism with your connection string as follow: var mongoClient = new MongoClient(\"mongodb://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/?authSource=<authenticationDb>&authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256\");  \nTIP \nDEFAULT MECHANISM MongoDB version 4.0 and later uses SCRAM-SHA-256 as the default authentication mechanism if the MongoDB server version supports it. To learn more on specifying the default mechanism, see Default. \nSCRAM-SHA-1 \nSCRAM-SHA-1 is s a salted challenge-response mechanism (SCRAM) that uses your username and password, encrypted with the SHA-1 algorithm, to authenticate your user. You can specify the SCRAM-SHA-1 authentication mechanism with your connection string as follow: var mongoClient = new MongoClient(\"mongodb://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/?authSource=<authenticationDb>&authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-1\");  \nTIP \nDEFAULT MECHANISM MongoDB version 4.0 uses SCRAM-SHA-1 as the default authorization mechanism if the server does not support SCRAM-SHA-256. To learn more on specifying the default mechanism, see Default. \nX.509 \nThe X.509 authentication mechanism uses TLS with X.509 certificates to authenticate your user, identified by the distinguished names of your client certificate. When you specify the X.509 authentication mechanism, the server authenticates the connection using the subject name of the client certificate. To learn more about using TLS/SSL, see our TLS/SSL guide. To learn more about X.509 certificates, see the X.509 Server Manual Entry. Select the Connection String or MongoCredential tab to see the corresponding syntax for specifying the X.509 authentication mechanism:   API DOCUMENTATION \nTo learn more about any of the methods or

MongoDB Server 5.0 or later. You should use the Stable API feature only if all of the MongoDB servers you're connecting to support this feature. \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to specify Stable API compatibility when connecting to a MongoDB instance or replica set. The Stable API feature forces the server to run operations with behaviors compatible with the API version you specify. When you update either your driver or server, the API version changes, which can change the way these operations behave. Using the Stable API ensures consistent responses from the server and provides long-term API stability for your application. The following sections describe how you can enable and customize Stable API for your MongoDB client. For more information about the Stable API, including a list of the commands it covers, see the MongoDB reference page. \nENABLE THE STABLE API ON A MONGODB CLIENT \nTo enable the Stable API, you must specify an API version in the settings of your MongoDB client. Once you instantiate a MongoClient instance with a specified API version, all commands you run with the client use that version of the Stable API. \nTIP Once you've created a MongoClient, you can't change its Stable API version. If you need to run commands using more than one version of the Stable API, instantiate a separate client with that version. If you need to run commands not covered by the Stable API, make sure the \"strict\" option is disabled. See the section on Stable API Options for more information. The following example shows how you can instantiate a MongoClient with a Stable API version and connect to a server through the following operations:       1. Construct a ServerApi instance and specify a Stable API version.  2. Construct a MongoClientSettings object and set the ServerApi property.  3. Create a MongoClient with the MongoClientSettings object. var serverApi = new ServerApi(ServerApiVersion.V1);var settings = new MongoClientSettings { ServerApi = serverApi };var client = new MongoClient(settings);  \nWARNING If you specify an API version and connect to a MongoDB server that does not support the Stable API, your code might raise an exception when executing a command on your MongoDB server. If you use a MongoClient that specifies the API version to query a server that doesn't support that version, your query could fail with an exception message that includes the following text: 'Unrecognized field 'apiVersion' on server... \nSTABLE API OPTIONS \nYou can use the options in the following table to customize the behavior of the Stable API. Option Name\nDescription\nStrict\nOptional. When true, if you call a command that is not part of the declared API version, the driver raises an exception. \nDefault: false\nDeprecationErrors\nOptional. When true, if you call a command that is deprecated in the declared API version, the driver raises an exception. \nDefault: false The following example shows how you can set these options when constructing a ServerApi object: var serverApi = new ServerApi(ServerApiVersion.V1, strict: true,    deprecationErrors: true);  \nAPI DOCUMENTATION \nFor more information on using the Stable API with the MongoDB .NET/C# Driver, see the following API documentation:  * MongoClient  * MongoClientSettings  * ServerApiVersion  * ServerApi ←  GUID SerializationAuthentication Mechanisms → On this page  *

API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to authenticate with MongoDB using the authentication mechanisms available only in the MongoDB Enterprise Edition. Authentication mechanisms are processes by which the driver and server confirm the identity of a client to ensure security before connecting. You can use the following authentication mechanisms with the latest version of MongoDB Enterprise Edition.      * GSSAPI/Kerberos  * LDAP (Plain) To authenticate using another mechanism, see the Authentication Mechanisms fundamentals page. For more information on establishing a connection to your MongoDB cluster, see the Connection Guide. You can specify your authentication mechanism and credentials when connecting to MongoDB using either of the following methods:  * A connection string, also known as a connection URI, which is a string that tells the driver how to connect to a MongoDB deployment and how to behave while connected.  * A factory method for the supported authentication mechanism, contained in the MongoCredential class. \nAUTHENTICATE WITH GSSAPI/KERBEROS \nThe Generic Security Services API (GSSAPI) authentication mechanism allows the user to authenticate to a Kerberos service using the user's principal name. The following examples specify the authentication mechanism using the following placeholders:  * <username>: Your URL-encoded principal name; for example \"username%40REALM.ME\"  * <password>: Your Kerberos user's password  * <hostname>: The network address of your MongoDB server, accessible by your client Select the Connection String or MongoCredential tab to see the corresponding syntax for specifying the GSSAPI/Kerberos authentication mechanism:   TIP \nOMITTING THE PASSWORD You can omit the password if one of the following are true:  * On Windows, the process owner running the application is the same as the user needing authentication.  * On Linux, the user has initialized their keytab via kinit username@REALM.COM. \nADDITIONAL PROPERTIES \nYou can specify additional properties with your authentication mechanism using the connection string or a factory method in the MongoCredential class. FULLY QUALIFIED DOMAIN NAME \nThe following example shows how to use the DNS server to retrieve the fully qualified domain name of the host:  \nREALM \nThe following example shows how to specify the user's realm when it is different from the service's realm:  \nSERVICE NAME \nThe following example shows how to specify the service name when it is not the default mongodb:  \nMULTIPLE PROPERTIES \nThe following example shows how to specify multiple authentication mechanism properties:   AUTHENTICATE WITH LDAP (PLAIN) \nYou can authenticate to a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server using your directory-server username and password. The following examples specify the authentication mechanism using the following placeholders:  * <username>: Your LDAP username  * <password>: Your LDAP password  * <hostname>: The network address of your MongoDB server, accessible by your client  * <authenticationDb>: The MongoDB database that contains your user's authentication Select the Connection String or MongoCredential tab to see the corresponding syntax for specifying the LDAP authentication mechanism:   API DOCUMENTATION \nTo learn more about any of the methods or types discussed in this guide, see the following API

Define a Sort\n * Define an Update\n * Define Index Keys\n * Build an Aggregation Pipeline\n * Build an Atlas Search Query\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn about the helper classes, or builders, that the .NET/C# Driver provides to create types used in your operations. Using builders helps you identify errors at compile time and avoid them at runtime. This guide provides information on builder classes that you can use for the following tasks:      * Creating a filter definition  * Creating a projection  * Defining a sort order  * Defining an update operation  * Selecting index keys \nTIP \nMONGODB ANALYZER The MongoDB Analyzer is a tool that helps you analyze your builders definitions and understand how your .NET/C# code translates into the MongoDB Query API. For more information and installation instructions, see the MongoDB Analyzer reference page. You should read this guide if you want to learn more about how to construct definitions and build up syntax using builders. \nSAMPLE CLASS \nThe code examples in this guide demonstrate how you can use builders to create types to interact with documents in the sample collection plants.flowers. Documents in this collection are modeled by the following Flower class: public class Flower{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }    public string Name { get; set; }    public string Category { get; set; }    public double Price { get; set; }    public List<string> Season { get; set; }    public double Stock { get; set; }    public string Description { get; set; }}  Each builder class takes a generic type parameter TDocument which represents the type of document that you are working with. In this guide, the Flower class is the document type used in each builder class example. \nCONSTRUCT A FILTER \nThe FilterDefinitionBuilder class provides a type-safe interface for building up queries. Suppose you want to query your collection for documents matching the following criteria:  * Price field value less than 20  * Category field value is \"Perennial\" Use builders to create the filter definition with the typed variant: var builder = Builders<Flower>.Filter;var filter = builder.Lt(f => f.Price, 20) & builder.Eq(f => f.Category, \"Perennial\");  Using the typed variant form provides compile-time safety. Additionally, your IDE can provide refactoring support. Alternatively, you can use string-based field names to contruct the filter: var builder = Builders<Flower>.Filter;var filter = builder.Lt(\"Price\", 20) & builder.Eq(\"Category\", \"Perennial\");  \nARRAY OPERATORS \nIf your document has properties or fields that serialize to arrays, you can use the methods beginning with Any, such as AnyEq() or AnyLt(), to compare the entire array against a single item. Use builders to check which documents in the collection have a Season array that includes \"winter\": var builder = Builders<Flower>.Filter;var filter = builder.AnyEq(f => f.Season, \"winter\");  \nCREATE A PROJECTION \nThe ProjectionDefinitionBuilder class provides a type-safe interface for defining a projection. Suppose you want to create a projection on the Name and Price fields, but exclude the Id field. Use builders to create the projection definition with the typed variant: var builder = Builders<Flower>.Projection;var projection = builder.Include(f => f.Name).Include(f => f.Price).Exclude(f => f.Id);  You can also use string-based field names to define the projection: var builder = Builders<Flower>.Projection;var projection = builder.Include(\"Name\").Include(\"Price\").Exclude(\"Id\");  Finally, you can use the Expression() method to define the projection: var builder = Builders<Flower>.Projection;var projection = builder.Expression(f => new { Name = f.Name, Price = f.Price });  This

You can also use lambda expressions to create new fields by performing operations on values in your documents. The following example shows how you can use a lambda expression to project a new Profit field using the Price and Stock fields: var builder = Builders<Flower>.Projection;var projection = builder.Expression(f => new { Profit = f.Price * f.Stock });  \nNOTE \nID FIELD EXCLUSION When you create a projection using a lambda expression, the output automatically excludes the Id field unless you explicitly include is as a projection field. \nDEFINE A SORT \nThe SortDefinitionBuilder class provides a type-safe interface for building up sort syntax. Suppose you want to define a sort with the following order:  * Ascending on Price  * Descending on Category Use builders to create the sort definition with the typed variant: var builder = Builders<Flower>.Sort;var sort = builder.Ascending(f => f.Price).Descending(f => f.Category);  Alternatively, you can use string-based field names to define the sort: var builder = Builders<Flower>.Sort;var sort = builder.Ascending(\"Price\").Descending(\"Category\");  \nDEFINE AN UPDATE \nThe UpdateDefinitionBuilder class provides a type-safe interface for building up an update specification. Suppose you want to create an update specification with the following criteria:  * Create the new field SunRequirement  * Multiply the Price field value by 0.9 Use builders to create the update specification with the typed variant: var builder = Builders<Flower>.Update;var update = builder.Set(f => f.SunRequirement, \"Full sun\").Mul(f => f.Price, 0.9);  Alternatively, you can use string-based field names to define the update: var builder = Builders<Flower>.Update;var update = builder.Set(\"SunRequirement\", \"Full sun\").Mul(\"Price\", 0.9);  \nDEFINE INDEX KEYS \nThe IndexKeysDefinitionBuilder class provides a type-safe interface for defining index keys. Suppose you want to select Category as an ascending index key. Use builders to select the index key with the typed variant: var builder = Builders<Flower>.IndexKeys;var keys = builder.Ascending(f => f.Category);  Alternatively, you can use string-based field names to select the index key: var builder = Builders<BsonDocument>.IndexKeys;var keys = builder.Ascending(\"Category\");  The IndexKeysDefinitionBuilder class also provides methods to build a wildcard index. You can create a wildcard index using All field paths or A single field path, in this case using Category:   BUILD AN AGGREGATION PIPELINE \nThe PipelineDefinitionBuilder class provides a type-safe interface for defining an aggregation pipeline. An aggregation pipeline is a series of stages that are used to transform a document. Suppose you want to create a pipeline that performs the following operations:  * Matches all documents with \"spring\" in the Season field  * Sorts the results by the Category field  * Groups the documents by category and shows the average price and total available for all documents in that category Use PipelineDefinitionBuilder classes to build the pipeline: var sortBuilder = Builders<Flower>.Sort.Ascending(f => f.Category);var matchFilter = Builders<Flower>.Filter.AnyEq(f => f.Season, \"spring\");\nvar pipeline = new EmptyPipelineDefinition<Flower>()    .Match(matchFilter)    .Sort(sortBuilder)    .Group(f => f.Category,           g => new              {                 name = g.Key,                 avgPrice = g.Average(f => f.Price),                 totalAvailable = g.Sum(f => f.Stock)               }          );  The preceding example creates the following pipeline: [{ \"$match\" : { \"season\" : \"spring\" } }, { \"$sort\" : { \"category\" : 1

To learn more about the $search pipeline stage, see $search. \nNOTE \nONLY AVAILABLE ON ATLAS FOR MONGODB V4.2 AND LATER The $search aggregation-pipeline operator is available only for collections hosted on MongoDB Atlas clusters running MongoDB v4.2 or later that are covered by an Atlas search index. To earn more about the required setup and the functionality of this operator, see the Atlas Search documentation. The examples in this guide use the following documents in a collection called guitars: { \"_id\": 1, \"make\": \"Fender\", \"description\": \"Classic guitars known for their versatility.\", \"establishedYear\": 1946, \"in-stock\": true, \"rating\": 9 }{ \"_id\": 2, \"make\": \"Gibson\", \"description\": \"Classic guitars known for their rich, full tones.\", \"establishedYear\": 1902, \"in-stock\": true, \"rating\": 8 }{ \"_id\": 3, \"make\": \"PRS\", \"description\": \"High-end guitars known for their quality.\", \"establishedYear\": 1985, \"in-stock\": true, \"rating\": 9 }{ \"_id\": 4, \"make\": \"Kiesel\", \"description\": \"Quality guitars made only for custom orders.\", \"establishedYear\": 2015, \"in-stock\": false }{ \"_id\": 5, \"make\": \"Ibanez\", \"description\": \"Well-crafted guitars used by many professional guitarists.\", \"establishedYear\": 1957, \"in-stock\": true, \"rating\": 7 }{ \"_id\": 6, \"make\": \"Strandberg\", \"description\": \"Modern guitars known for their headless models.\", \"establishedYear\": 1982, \"in-stock\": false }  The following Guitar class models the documents in this collection. public class Guitar{    public int Id { get; set; }    public string Make { get; set; }    public List<string> Models { get; set; }    public int EstablishedYear { get; set; }    [BsonElement(\"in-stock\")]    public bool InStock { get; set; }    public int? Rating { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the guitars collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Guitar class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. \nCREATE AN ATLAS SEARCH INDEX \nBefore you can perform a search on an Atlas collection, you must first create an Atlas Search index on the collection. An Atlas Search index is a data structure that categorizes data in a searchable format. To learn how to create an Atlas Search Index see the Create an Atlas Search Index Atlas guide. \nATLAS SEARCH OPERATORS \nThe Search class contains methods you can use to perform $search operations. For a full list of available $search operators, see the Operators and Collectors Atlas guide. \nNOTE The Search class does not currently support the $embeddedDocument operator. \nAUTOCOMPLETE \nUse the Autocomplete method to search for a word or phrase that contains a sequence of characters from an incomplete input string. The following example performs an autocomplete search on the guitars collection using the string \"Gib\" in the make field. var result = guitarsCollection.Aggregate()    .Search(Builders<Guitar>.Search.Autocomplete(g => g.Make, \"Gib\"))    .ToList();  The search returns the following document: { \"_id\" : 2, \"make\" : \"Gibson\", \"description\" : \"Classic guitars

The following example searches the guitars collection for any documents in which the value of the in-stock field is true. var result = guitarsCollection.Aggregate()    .Search(Builders<Guitar>.Search.Equals(g => g.InStock, true))    .ToList();  The search returns the following documents: { \"_id\" : 1, \"make\" : \"Fender\", \"description\" : \"...\", \"establishedYear\" : 1946, \"in-stock\" : true, \"rating\" : 9 }{ \"_id\" : 2, \"make\" : \"Gibson\", \"description\" : \"...\", \"establishedYear\" : 1902, \"in-stock\" : true, \"rating\" : 8 }{ \"_id\" : 3, \"make\" : \"PRS\", \"description\" : \"...\", \"establishedYear\" : 1985, \"in-stock\" : true, \"rating\" : 9 }{ \"_id\" : 5, \"make\" : \"Ibanez\", \"description\" : \"...\", \"establishedYear\" : 1957, \"in-stock\" : true, \"rating\" : 7 }  To learn more about the equals operator, see the equals Atlas guide. \nEXISTS \nUse the Exists method to search for documents in which a specified indexed field name exists. If the specified field exists but is not indexed, the document is not included with the result set. The following example searches the guitars collection for any documents in which the rating field exists. var result = guitarsCollection.Aggregate()    .Search(Builders<Guitar>.Search.Exists(g => g.Rating))    .ToList();  The search returns the following documents: { \"_id\" : 1, \"make\" : \"Fender\", \"description\" : \"...\", \"establishedYear\" : 1946, \"in-stock\" : true, \"rating\" : 9 }{ \"_id\" : 2, \"make\" : \"Gibson\", \"description\" : \"...\", \"establishedYear\" : 1902, \"in-stock\" : true, \"rating\" : 8 }{ \"_id\" : 3, \"make\" : \"PRS\", \"description\" : \"...\", \"establishedYear\" : 1985, \"in-stock\" : true, \"rating\" : 9 }{ \"_id\" : 5, \"make\" : \"Ibanez\", \"description\" : \"...\", \"establishedYear\" : 1957, \"in-stock\" : true, \"rating\" : 7 }  To learn more about the exists operator, see the exists Atlas guide. \nGEOSHAPE \nUse the GeoShape method to search for documents in relation to a given geometry. When specifying the coordinates to search, longitude must be specified first, followed by latitude. Longitude values can be between -180 and 180, inclusive.

Longitude values can be between -180 and 180, inclusive. Latitude values can be between -90 and 90, inclusive. \nNOTE Atlas Search does not support the following:  * Non-default coordinate reference system (CRS)  * Planar XY coordinate system (2 dimensional)  * Coordinate pairs Point notation (pointFieldName: [12, 34]) Consider some documents in the guitars collection have added an in-stock-location field.

The following example searches the guitars collection for all documents with an establishedYear value greater than 1980 and less than 2020. var result = guitarsCollection.Aggregate()    .Search(Builders<Guitar>.Search.Range(g => g.EstablishedYear, SearchRangeBuilder.Gt(1980).Lt(2020)))    .ToList();  The search returns the following results: { \"_id\" : 3, \"make\" : \"PRS\", \"description\" : \"High-end guitars known for their quality.\", \"establishedYear\" : 1985, \"in-stock\" : true, \"rating\" : 9 }{ \"_id\" : 4, \"make\" : \"Kiesel\", \"description\" : \"Quality guitars made only for custom orders.\", \"establishedYear\" : 2015, \"in-stock\" : false, \"rating\" : null }{ \"_id\" : 6, \"make\" : \"Strandberg\", \"description\" : \"Modern guitars known for their headless models.\", \"establishedYear\" : 1982, \"in-stock\" : false, \"rating\" : null }  To learn more about the range operator, see the range Atlas guide. \nREGEX \nUse the Regex method to search for documents using a regular expression. The following example searches the guitars collection for documents in which the value of the make field contains exactly six letters. var regex = \"[A-Za-z]{6}\";\nvar result = guitarsCollection.Aggregate()    .Search(Builders<Guitar>.Search.Regex(g => g.Make, regex))    .ToList();  The search returns the following results: { \"_id\" : 1, \"make\" : \"Fender\", \"description\" : \"Classic guitars known for their versatility.\", \"establishedYear\" : 1946, \"in-stock\" : true, \"rating\" : 9 }{ \"_id\" : 2, \"make\" : \"Gibson\", \"description\" : \"Classic guitars known for their rich, full tones.\", \"establishedYear\" : 1902, \"in-stock\" : true, \"rating\" : 8 }{ \"_id\" : 4, \"make\" : \"Kiesel\", \"description\" : \"Quality guitars made only for custom orders.\", \"establishedYear\" : 2015, \"in-stock\" : false, \"rating\" : null }{ \"_id\" : 5, \"make\" : \"Ibanez\", \"description\" : \"Well-crafted guitars used by many professional guitarists.\", \"establishedYear\" : 1957, \"in-stock\" : true, \"rating\" : 7 }  \nNOTE By default the regex operator cannot run on an analyzed field. You can allow it to run on an analyzed field by setting allowAnalyzedField option to true, as follows: var result = guitarsCollection.Aggregate() .Search(Builders<Guitar>.Search.Regex(g => g.Make,

To learn more about the regex operator, see the regex Atlas guide. \nSPAN \nUse the Span method to search for text search matches within regions of a field. You can use this method to find strings which are near each other to specified degrees of precision. \nNOTE The span operator is more computationally intensive than other operators because queries must keep track of positional information. The following example searches the guitars collection for documents in which the value of the description field contains the strings \"guitars\" and \"quality\" within one word of each other. var searchTerms = new[]{     Builders<Guitar>.SearchSpan.Term(g => g.Description, \"guitars\"),     Builders<Guitar>.SearchSpan.Term(g => g.Description, \"quality\") };\nvar result = guitarsCollection.Aggregate()    .Search(Builders<Guitar>.Search.Span(Builders<Guitar>.SearchSpan.Near(searchTerms, 1)))    .ToList();  The search returns the following document: { \"_id\" : 4, \"make\" : \"Kiesel\", \"description\" : \"Quality guitars made only for custom orders.\", \"establishedYear\" : 2015, \"in-stock\" : false, \"rating\" : null }  Although the document with _id: 3 contains the strings \"guitars\" and \"quality\", they are separated by more than one word, so the search omits this document from the results. To learn more about the span operator, see the span Atlas guide. \nTEXT \nUse the Text method to search a document for a given string or array of strings. If there are multiple terms in a given string, Atlas Search also looks for a match for each term in the string separately. The following example searches the guitars collection for documents in which the value of the description field contains the string \"used by professionals\". var result = guitarsCollection.Aggregate()    .Search(Builders<Guitar>.Search.Text(g => g.Description, \"used by professional\"))    .ToList();  The search returns the following document: { \"_id\" : 5, \"make\" : \"Ibanez\", \"description\" : \"Well-crafted guitars used by many professional guitarists.\", \"establishedYear\" : 1957, \"in-stock\" : true, \"rating\" : 7 }  \nTIP If your search string contains multiple terms, the method also looks for a match for each term in the string separately. To learn more about the text operator, see the text Atlas guide. \nWILDCARD \nUse the Wildcard method to search for documents using special characters in your search string that can match any character. You can use the following characters in your search: Character\nDescription\n?\nMatches any single character\n*\nMatches 0 or more characters\n\\\nEscape character The following example searches for documents in which the value of the make field contains the string \"Strand\" followed by any other characters. var result = guitarsCollection.Aggregate()    .Search(Builders<Guitar>.Search.Wildcard(g => g.Make, \"Strand*\"))    .ToList();  The search returns the following document: { \"_id\" : 6, \"make\" : \"Strandberg\", \"description\" : \"Modern guitars known for their headless models.\", \"establishedYear\" : 1982, \"in-stock\" : false, \"rating\" : null }  \nNOTE By default the wildcard operator cannot run on an analyzed field. You can allow it to run on an analyzed field by setting allowAnalyzedField option to true, as follows: var result =  guitarsCollection.Aggregate() .Search(Builders<Guitar>.Search.Wildcard(g => g.Make, \"Strand*\", true)) .ToList();  Setting the allowAnalyzedField option to true may lead to unexpected search results.

Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to customize the way the MongoDB .NET/C# Driver maps BSON documents to and from C# classes. You should read this page to learn more about the default class mapping behavior, or if you need to customize the way the driver serializes or deserializes your data. \nAUTOMATIC CLASS MAPPING \nWhen you use a class, rather than a BsonDocument, to represent data in a MongoDB collection, the .NET/C# Driver automatically creates a class map that it uses to serialize or deserialize your data. It does this mapping by matching the name of the field in the document to the name of the property in the class. \nIMPORTANT The type of the property in your class should match the type of the field in the document. The .NET/C# Driver instantiates a serializer based on the type of the property in your class. If the types don't match when the driver attempts to deserialize the data, the serializer throws an exception. \nMANUALLY CREATING A CLASS MAP \nYou can bypass the driver's automatic class mapping functionality, and manually define the class map by using the RegisterClassMap() method. The following example defines a Person class: public class Person{    public string Name { get; set; }    public int Age { get; set; }    public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}}  The following code demonstrates how to register the class map for the Person class: BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classMap =>{    classMap.MapMember(p => p.Name);    classMap.MapMember(p => p.Age);    classMap.MapMember(p => p.Hobbies);});  \nIMPORTANT You must register a class map before it's needed in your code. We recommend registering class maps prior to initializing a connection with MongoDB. You can also manually map a subset of class properties, while still allowing the driver to automatically map the remaining properties. To do this, register a class map and call the AutoMap() method before manually specifying your properties. In the following code example, the AutoMap() method maps all properties of the Person class, then manually adjusts the mapping for the Hobbies field: BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classMap =>{    classMap.AutoMap();    classMap.MapMember(p => p.Hobbies).SetElementName(\"favorite_hobbies\");});  \nCUSTOMIZE CLASS SERIALIZATION \nYou can customize how the driver serializes and deserializes documents at the class level by using attributes with the class or by calling methods while registering a class map. \nIGNORE EXTRA ELEMENTS \nWhen a BSON document is deserialized to a C# class, the .NET/C# Driver looks at the name of each field in the document and tries to find a matching property name in the class. By default, if a field in the document doesn't have a match in the class, the driver throws an exception. You can choose to ignore any elements that do not have a matching class property by using the BsonIgnoreExtraElements attribute. This prevents the driver from throwing an exception, and maps any other fields that have matching class properties. The following example shows how to add a BsonIgnoreExtraElements attribute to a class. [BsonIgnoreExtraElements]public class Person{    public string Name { get; set; }    public int Age { get; set; }    public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}}  You can also ignore any extra elements

You can specify a discriminator using the BsonDiscriminator attribute as follows: [BsonDiscriminator(\"personClass\")]public class Person{    public string Name { get; set; }    public int Age { get; set; }    public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}}  You can also specify a discriminator when registering a class map as follows: BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classMap =>{    classMap.AutoMap();    classMap.SetDiscriminator(\"personClass\");});  In BSON, discriminators have the field name _t. The following example shows how a document from the Person class with the \"personClass\" discriminator appears in the collection after serialization: { \"_id\": \"...\", \"_t\": \"personClass\", \"Name\": \"...\", \"Age\": \"...\", \"Hobbies\": [...]}  \nMAPPING WITH CONSTRUCTORS \nBy default, the .NET/C# Driver can automatically map a class only if the class has a constructor with no arguments. If you want the driver to use a constructor that accepts one or more arguments, you can add the BsonConstructor attribute to the constructor. In this case, the driver the driver examines the types to determine how to map the constructor arguments to class properties or fields. When the driver creates a class map for the following Person class, it will use the constructor marked with the BsonConstructor attribute. The name argument will map to the Name property and the age argument will map to the Age property. public class Person{    public string Name { get; set; }    public int Age { get; set; }    public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}\n    [BsonConstructor]    public Person(string name, string age)    {        Name = name;        Age = age;    }}  \nTIP \nMULTIPLE BSONCONSTRUCTOR ATTRIBUTES If there is more than one constructor with the BsonConstructor attribute, the driver uses the constructor that has the most parameters with matching fields in the document. You can also specify the constructor to use when registering your class map: public class Person{    public string Name { get; set; }    public int Age { get; set; }    public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}\n    public Person(string name, string age)    {        Name = name;        Age = age;    }}\nBsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classMap =>{    classMap.AutoMap();    classMap.MapCreator(p => new Person(p.Name, p.Age));});  \nCUSTOMIZE PROPERTY SERIALIZATION \nYou can customize how the driver serializes a class property by adding attributes to the property. For more information about custom property serialization, see Custom Serialization. \nSUPPORT EXTRA ELEMENTS \nYou can design your C# class to store any extra elements in your document that don't have matching class properties. To do this your class must have a BsonDocument type property to hold the extra elements. The following code uses the BsonExtraElements attribute with the ExtraElements property to direct the driver to store extra elements: public class Person{    public string Name { get; set;    public int Age { get; set; }    public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}    [BsonExtraElements]    public BsonDocument ExtraElements {get; set;}}  You can also support extra elements when initializing a class map as follows: BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classMap =>{    classMap.AutoMap();    classMap.MapExtraElementsMember(p => p.ExtraElements);});  \nNOTE After the driver serializes a class with

or POCOs, with the .NET/C# Driver for your operations and queries. POCOs are simple class objects that do not inherit features from any framework-specific base classes or interfaces. We recommend using POCOs in your C# code to adhere to idiomatic driver usage and achieve the best performance. You should read this guide if you want to learn more about how to use POCOs with the .NET/C# Driver or if you need to adjust the driver's default field mapping behavior. \nCREATE A POCO \nYou can create a POCO by defining a simple class that does not implement interfaces or extend classes from a framework. When you execute an operation such as a read or write using a POCO, the driver internally serializes, or converts, the POCO to BSON. Select the POCO or BSON tab to see how the driver serializes a sample POCO to BSON:  \nYou can define a POCO with any object structure that suits your needs, including nested objects, arrays, lists, and any data types. \nCUSTOM SERIALIZATION \nIf the default field mapping behavior does not meet your needs, you can specify custom behavior using serialization-related attributes. These attributes change the way that the driver serializes each property of your POCO. This section describes some of the common serialization-related attributes. \nSET FIELD NAMES \nThe driver serializes POCO properties to BSON fields with the same field name and capitalization. To store a property under a different name, use the [BsonElement()] attribute. The following code maps the YearBuilt property of the House class to the year_built field in the serialized BSON document: public class House{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"year_built\")]    public int YearBuilt { get; set; }}  Though it is common to use the Pascal case naming convention when defining C# classes, using the [BsonElement()] attribute allows you to select a different or custom naming convention in your MongoDB collection. \nTIP \nSET CUSTOM FIELD NAME CONVENTION If you want to serialize every property with a custom field name, you can define a ConventionPack instead of using the [BsonElement()] attribute. For example, if you define your class using the Pascal case naming convention, you can use the following code to use camel case field names in the serialized document: var camelCaseConvention = new ConventionPack { new CamelCaseElementNameConvention() };ConventionRegistry.Register(\"CamelCase\", camelCaseConvention, type => true);  \nSELECT TYPE REPRESENTATION \nTo serialize a C# property to a specific BSON type, use the [BsonRepresentation()] attribute. This works only if the C# primitive type is convertible to the BSON type you specify. In the following code sample, the YearBuilt property, defined as a char in C#, is serialized as a BSON Int32 type: public class House{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    [BsonRepresentation(BsonType.Int32)]    public char YearBuilt { get; set; }}  For more information on valid type conversions, see the C# Conversions Specification. \nSET FIELD ORDER \nThe driver serializes properties to BSON fields in the order they are specified in the POCO. To store properties in a custom order to match an existing schema, you can specify the Order named parameter in the [BsonElement()] attribute. In the following code sample, the driver stores the YearBuilt property after the Style property: public class House{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(Order = 2)]    public int YearBuilt { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(Order = 1)]    public string Style { get; set; }}  If any properties don't have an explicit Order, the driver will serialize them in the default order after

public class House{    [BsonId]    public string Identifier { get; set; }}  \nWARNING \nMULTIPLE ID FIELDS If you identify more than one property as the _id field using the [BsonId()] attribute, the driver throws a DuplicateBsonMemberMapAttributeException. If you specify the same database field more than once (for example, if your POCO includes properties named Id and _id), the driver throws a BsonSerializationException. \nOMIT EMPTY FIELDS \nBy default, the driver serializes undefined properties to fields with null values. To ignore undefined properties during serialization, use the [BsonIgnore()] attribute. The following code shows how you can prevent the driver from serializing the YearBuilt property if it is undefined: public class House{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    [BsonIgnore]    public int YearBuilt { get; set; }    public string Style { get; set; }}  \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example shows how to insert a Clothing document with custom field mapping specifications into MongoDB. The following code defines the Clothing class with these serialization-related attributes:      * [BsonElement()], which specifies custom field names in the camel case naming convention  * [BsonRepresentation()], which specifies serialization of the Price field as a BSON Double type public class Clothing{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"name\")]    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"inStock\")]    public bool InStock { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"price\")]    [BsonRepresentation(BsonType.Decimal128)]    public decimal Price { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"colorSelection\")]    public List<string> ColorSelection { get; set; }}  The following code instantiates a Clothing object and inserts the document into a collection: var doc = new Clothing{    Name = \"Denim Jacket\",    InStock = false,    Price = 32.99m,    ColorSelection = new List<string> { \"dark wash\", \"light wash\" }};\n_myColl.InsertOne(doc);  The BSON representation of the inserted document looks like this: {  \"_id\": ObjectId(\"...\"),  \"name\": \"Denim Jacket\",  \"inStock\": false,  \"price\": 32.99,  \"colorSelection\": [ \"dark wash\", \"light wash\" ]} \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nFor a full list of serialization-related attributes, see the Serialization.Attributes API documentation.

File\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to create BSON documents, read BSON from a file, and write BSON to a file using the .NET/C# Driver. \nBSON DATA FORMAT \nBSON, or Binary JSON, is the data format that MongoDB uses to organize and store data. This data format includes all JSON data structure types and adds support for types including dates, different size integers, ObjectIds, and binary data. For a complete list of supported types, see the BSON Types server manual page. The code samples in this guide use the following BSON document as an example: {    \"address\" : {        \"street\" : \"Pizza St\",        \"zipcode\" : \"10003\"    },    \"coord\" : [-73.982419, 41.579505]    \"cuisine\" : \"Pizza\",    \"name\" : \"Mongo's Pizza\"}  \nCREATE A BSON DOCUMENT \nTo build a BSON document in C#, create an instance of the BsonDocument class. The BsonDocument constructor accepts BsonElement arguments that map to the fields and values in the document. Each BsonElement can be either an instance of the BsonElement class or a field-value pair inside curly braces ( {} ). The following code sample shows how to create a BsonDocument object to represent the example BSON document. Each key-value pair in the BsonDocument object is a BsonElement object. var newRestaurant = new BsonDocument{    { \"address\", new BsonDocument        {            { \"street\", \"Pizza St\" },            { \"zipcode\", \"10003\" }        }    },    { \"coord\", new BsonArray        {-73.982419, 41.579505 }    },    { \"cuisine\", \"Pizza\" },    { \"name\", \"Mongo's Pizza\"}};  \nCHANGE A BSON DOCUMENT \nThe BsonDocument class includes methods that let you change the contents of the BSON document. The following code sample makes three changes to the previous BsonDocument object:       1. Adds a new field, \"restaurant_id\", with the value \"12345\"  2. Removes the \"cuisine\" field  3. Sets the value of the \"name\" field to \"Mongo's Pizza Palace\" var newRestaurant = new BsonDocument{    { \"address\", new BsonDocument        {            { \"street\", \"Pizza St\" },            { \"zipcode\", \"10003\" }        }    },    { \"coord\", new BsonArray        {-73.982419, 41.579505 }    },    { \"cuisine\", \"Pizza\" },    { \"name\", \"Mongo's Pizza\"}};newRestaurant.Add(new BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\", \"12345\"));newRestaurant.Remove(\"cuisine\");newRestaurant.Set(\"name\", \"Mongo's Pizza Palace\");  \nNOTE For a full list of methods in the BsonDocument class, see the API Documentation. \nWRITE BSON TO A FILE \nYou can write BSON to a file using the methods in the BsonBinaryWriter class. To write to a file, perform the following steps:  1. Open a file stream for the file containing BSON data.  2. Create a BsonBinaryWriter using the file stream.  3.

 5. To start and end arrays, use WriteStartArray() and WriteEndArray().  6. At the end of each document and subdocument, call WriteEndDocument(). The following code sample shows how to write the sample BSON document to myFile.bson: string outputFileName = \"myFile.bson\";\nusing (var stream = File.OpenWrite(outputFileName))using (var writer = new BsonBinaryWriter(stream)){    writer.WriteStartDocument();\n    //address    writer.WriteName(\"address\");    writer.WriteStartDocument();    writer.WriteName(\"street\");    writer.WriteString(\"Pizza St\");    writer.WriteName(\"zipcode\");    writer.WriteString(\"10003\");    writer.WriteEndDocument();\n    //coord    writer.WriteName(\"coord\");    writer.WriteStartArray();    writer.WriteDouble(-73.982419);    writer.WriteDouble(41.579505);    writer.WriteEndArray();\n    //cuisine    writer.WriteName(\"cuisine\");    writer.WriteString(\"Pizza\");\n    //name    writer.WriteName(\"name\");    writer.WriteString(\"Mongo's Pizza\");\n    writer.WriteEndDocument();}  The resulting BSON document looks like the following: {    \"address\" : {        \"street\" : \"Pizza St\",        \"zipcode\" : \"10003\"    },    \"coord\" : [-73.982419, 41.579505]    \"cuisine\" : \"Pizza\",    \"name\" : \"Mongo's Pizza\"}  \nREAD BSON FROM A FILE \nTo read a BSON document from a file, follow the same steps used for writing a BSON document to a file, with two differences:  * Use BsonBinaryReader instead of BsonBinaryWriter.  * Use Read* methods instead of Write* methods. These methods return field names and values from the BSON document. The following code sample shows how to read the fields and values from the sample BSON document stored in myFile.bson: string inputFileName = \"myFile.bson\";\nusing (var stream = File.OpenRead(inputFileName))using (var reader = new BsonBinaryReader(stream)){    reader.ReadStartDocument();\n    //address    string addressFieldName = reader.ReadName();    reader.ReadStartDocument();    string streetFieldName = reader.ReadName();    string streetValue = reader.ReadString();    string zipFieldName = reader.ReadName();    string zipValue = reader.ReadString();    reader.ReadEndDocument();\n    //coord    string coordFieldName = reader.ReadName();    reader.ReadStartArray();    double coord1 = reader.ReadDouble();    double coord2 = reader.ReadDouble();    reader.ReadEndArray();\n    //cuisine    string cuisineFieldName = reader.ReadName();    string cuisineValue = reader.ReadString();\n    //name    string nameFieldName = reader.ReadName();    string nameValue = reader.ReadString();\n    reader.ReadEndDocument();}  \nWARNING If you call ReadName() twice in a row without reading a value, the driver will throw an InvalidOperationException. \nTIP The BsonBinaryReader and BsonBinaryWriter constructors accept any System.IO.Stream object. This means that you can read or write any location that can be accessed by a stream. \nAPI DOCUMENTATION \nTo learn more about any of the methods or types discussed in this guide, see the following

Information \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to serialize globally unique identifiers (GUIDs), also known as universally unique identifiers (UUIDs). \nTIP In MongoDB applications, ObjectId can be used as a unique identifier for a document. Consider using ObjectId in place of a GUID with MongoDB applications where possible. A GUID is a 16-byte integer that you can use as a unique ID for a MongoDB document. Originally, GUIDs in MongoDB were represented as BsonBinaryData values of subtype 3. Subtype 3 did not standardize the byte order during serialization, which led to inconsistent serialization across MongoDB drivers. To standardize the byte order and ensure consistent serialization across drivers, we created BsonBinaryData subtype 4. \nNOTE Use BsonBinaryData subtype 4 for all new GUIDs. \nGUIDREPRESENTATIONMODE \nIn many MongoDB collections, all GUID fields use the same subtype of BsonBinaryData. Some older collections, however, may contain some GUID fields that use subtype 3 and others that use subtype 4. To ensure that the driver serializes and deserializes all GUIDs correctly, you should set the BsonDefaults.GuidRepresentationMode property to one of the following GuidRepresentationMode values: \nV2 \nGuidRepresentationMode.V2 assumes that all GUIDs in a document use the same BsonBinaryData subtype. In this mode, GUID representation is controlled by the reader or writer, not the serializer. V2 is the default GuidRepresentationMode. \nNOTE When version 3 of the .NET/C# Driver is released, support for GuidRepresentationMode.V2 will be removed from the driver and V3 will become the default. \nV3 \nGuidRepresentationMode.V3 allows fields in the same document to use different GUID formats. In this mode, GUID representation is controlled at the property level by configuring the serializer for each property. To use GuidRepresentationMode.V3, run the following line of code. You should run this code during the bootstrapping phase of your application, before creating a MongoClient object. BsonDefaults.GuidRepresentationMode = GuidRepresentationMode.V3;  Running in V3 mode changes the behavior of the driver in the following ways:      * The BsonBinaryReader.ReadBinaryData() method ignores readerSettings.GuidRepresentation  * The BsonBinaryWriter.WriteBinaryData() method ignores writerSettings.GuidRepresentation  * The JsonReader.ReadBinaryData() method ignores readerSettings.GuidRepresentation  * JsonWriter ignores writerSettings.GuidRepresentation  * Calling the BsonBinaryData.ToGuid() method without the GuidRepresentation parameter works only on GUIDs of subtype 4. \nNOTE You can't use both GuidRepresentationMode.V2 and GuidRepresentationMode.V3 in a single application. \nSERIALIZING GUIDS IN V3 \nGuidRepresentationMode.V3 handles GUID serialization at the level of individual properties. This mode is more flexible than V2, but it also means you must ensure that each GUID field is serialized and deserialized correctly. If you're using the .NET/C# Driver to automap your C# classes to document schemas, you can use the BsonGuidRepresentation attribute on a GUID property to specify the representation: public class Widget{    public int Id { get; set; }\n   [BsonGuidRepresentation(GuidRepresentation.Standard)]   public Guid G { get; set; }}  \nNOTE GuidRepresentation.Standard is equivalent to BsonBinaryData subtype 4. Other GUID representations in the .NET/C# Driver, such as CSharpLegacy, JavaLegacy, and PythonLegacy, are equivalent to subtype 3 but use different byte orders. If you're writing your own serialization code, you can use the GuidSerializer class to serialize and deserialize individual GUID values to and from BSON fields. To ensure that the driver handles GUIDs correctly, use the GuidRepresentation parameter when you construct a GuidSerializer.

 If most of your GUIDs use the same representation, you can register a GuidSerializer globally. To create and register a GuidSerializer, run the following code early in your application, such as during the bootstrapping phase: BsonSerializer.RegisterSerializer(new GuidSerializer(GuidRepresentation.Standard));  \nTIP When you're working with two subtypes, you can combine a global serializer with the BsonGuidRepresentation property attribute. For example, you can register a global serializer for the most commonly used GUID subtype, then use the BsonGuidRepresentation attribute to denote any GUID properties of another subtype. \nSERIALIZING OBJECTS IN V3 \nYou can use an ObjectSerializer to serialize hierarchical objects to subdocuments. To ensure that GUIDs in these objects are serialized and deserialized correctly when using V3, you should select the correct GUID representation when constructing your ObjectSerializer. The following code sample shows how to create an ObjectSerializer for a GUID representation of subtype 4: var objectDiscriminatorConvention = BsonSerializer.LookupDiscriminatorConvention(typeof(object));var objectSerializer = new ObjectSerializer(objectDiscriminatorConvention, GuidRepresentation.Standard);  If your application relies on an ObjectSerializer to serialize any GUIDs, you must also register the serializer early in your application, such as during the bootstrapping phase. The serializer that you register will be used globally whenever an object serializer is needed and has not been otherwise specified. To register your ObjectSerializer, pass it to the BsonSerializer.RegisterSerializer() method: var objectDiscriminatorConvention = BsonSerializer.LookupDiscriminatorConvention(typeof(object));var objectSerializer = new ObjectSerializer(objectDiscriminatorConvention, GuidRepresentation.Standard);BsonSerializer.RegisterSerializer(objectSerializer);  \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nTo learn more about

LINQ allows you to construct queries against strongly typed collections of objects by using language keywords and operators. The .NET/C# Driver automatically translates LINQ queries into aggregation operations. The examples in this guide use the restaurants collection in the sample_restaurants database provided in the Atlas sample datasets. To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the Quick Start. The following Restaurant, Address and GradeEntry classes model the documents in this collection: public class Restaurant{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\")]    public string RestaurantId { get; set; }\n    public string Cuisine { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n    public string Borough { get; set; }\n    public List<GradeEntry> Grades { get; set; }\n}  public class Address{    public string Building { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"coord\")]    public float[] Coordinates { get; set; }\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"zipcode\")]    public string ZipCode { get; set; }}  public class GradeEntry{    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    public string Grade { get; set; }\n    public float Score { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the restaurants collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Restaurant class.

To create the object, use the AsQueryable() method as follows:  var restaurantsCollection = restaurantsDatabase.GetCollection<Restaurant>(\"restaurants\"); var queryableCollection = restaurantsCollection.AsQueryable();  The AsQueryable() method returns an IMongoQueryable instance that has the IQueryable extension methods, along with a set of MongoDB specific methods. Once you have the queryable object, you can compose a query using method syntax. Some pipeline stages also support query comprehension syntax, which resembles SQL query syntax. Select the Method Syntax or Query Syntax tab to see how to compose a query using LINQ:  \nYou can print the results of the preceding example as follows: foreach (var restaurant in query){    Console.WriteLine(restaurant.ToJson());} HIDE OUTPUT { \"name\" : \"The Movable Feast\", \"address\" : { \"building\" : \"284\", \"coord\" : [-73.982923900000003, 40.6580753], \"street\" : \"Prospect Park West\", \"zipcode\" : \"11215\" } } \nTIP \nACCESSING QUERY RESULTS You can also access the results of your query by using the ToList() or ToCursor() methods: var results = query.ToList();  var results = query.ToCursor();  \nSUPPORTED AGGREGATION STAGES \nYou can use LINQ to create an aggregation pipeline. The .NET/C# Driver automatically translates each LINQ statement into the corresponding aggregation pipeline stages. In this section you can learn which aggregation pipeline stages are supported. To learn more about the aggregation pipeline stages, see the Aggregation Pipeline Stages page in the server manual. \n$PROJECT \nThe $project aggregation stage returns a document containing only the specified fields.

 \nNOTE \nEXCLUDING THE _ID FIELD If you don't include the _id field in your LINQ projection, the .NET/C# Driver automatically excludes it from the results. \n$MATCH \nThe $match aggregation stage returns the documents that match a specified criteria. Select the Method Syntax or Query Syntax tab to see how to generate a $match stage using LINQ:  \nThe result of the preceding example contains the following document: // Results Truncated\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(...), \"name\" : \"The Movable Feast\", \"restaurant_id\" : \"40361606\", \"cuisine\" : \"American\", \"address\" : {...}, \"borough\" : \"Brooklyn\", \"grades\" : [...] }  \n$LIMIT \nThe $limit aggregation stage limits the number of documents returned by the query. The following example shows how to generate a $limit stage using LINQ: var query = queryableCollection    .Where(r => r.Cuisine == \"Italian\")    .Select(r => new {r.Name, r.Cuisine})    .Take(5);  The result of the preceding example contains the following documents: { \"name\" : \"Philadelhia Grille Express\", \"cuisine\" : \"Italian\" }{ \"name\" : \"Isle Of Capri Resturant\", \"cuisine\" : \"Italian\" }{ \"name\" : \"Marchis Restaurant\", \"cuisine\" : \"Italian\" }{ \"name\" : \"Crystal Room\", \"cuisine\" : \"Italian\" }{ \"name\" : \"Forlinis Restaurant\", \"cuisine\" : \"Italian\" }  \n$SKIP \nThe $skip aggregation stage skips over a specified number of documents returned by a query, then returns the rest of the results. The following example shows how to generate a $skip stage using LINQ: var query = queryableCollection    .Where(r => r.Cuisine == \"Italian\")    .Select(r => new {r.Name, r.Cuisine})    .Skip(2);  The preceding example skips the first two restaurants that match the criteria, and returns the rest. The result contains the following documents: // Results Truncated\n{ \"name\" : \"Marchis Restaurant\", \"cuisine\" : \"Italian\" }{ \"name\" : \"Crystal Room\", \"cuisine\" : \"Italian\" }{ \"name\" : \"Forlinis Restaurant\", \"cuisine\" : \"Italian\" }...  \n$UNWIND \nThe $unwind aggregation stage deconstructs a specified array field and returns a document for each element in that array. Select the Method Syntax or Query Syntax tab to see how to generate an $unwind stage using LINQ:  \nThe query in the preceding example finds the document where the Name field has the value \"The Movable Feast.\" Then, for each element in this document's Grades array, the query returns a new document.

\n$SORT \nThe $sort aggregation stage returns the results of your query in the order that you specify. Select the Method Syntax or Query Syntax tab to see how to generate an $sort stage using LINQ:  \nThe preceding example returns the query results sorted alphabetically by the Name field, with a secondary descending sort on the RestaurantId field. The following is a subset of the documents contained in the returned results: // Results Truncated\n...{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(...), \"name\" : \"Aba Turkish Restaurant\", \"restaurant_id\" : \"41548686\", \"cuisine\" : \"Turkish\", \"address\" : {...}, \"borough\" : \"Manhattan\", \"grades\" : [...] }{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(...), \"name\" : \"Abace Sushi\", \"restaurant_id\" : \"50006214\", \"cuisine\" : \"Japanese\", \"address\" : { ... }, \"borough\" : \"Manhattan\", \"grades\" : [...] }{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(...), \"name\" : \"Abacky Potluck\", \"restaurant_id\" : \"50011222\", \"cuisine\" : \"Asian\", \"address\" : { ... }, \"borough\" : \"Manhattan\", \"grades\" : [...] }{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(...), \"name\" : \"Abaleh\", \"restaurant_id\" : \"50009096\", \"cuisine\" : \"Mediterranean\", \"address\" : { ... }, \"borough\" : \"Manhattan\", \"grades\" : [...] }...  \n$LOOKUP \nThe $lookup aggregation stage joins documents from one collection to documents from another collection in the same database. The $lookup stage adds a new array field to each input document. The new array field contains the matching documents from the \"joined\" collection. \nNOTE To perform a lookup, you must make both collections queryable using the AsQueryable method. To learn how to make a collection queryable, see Make A Collection Queryable. Consider a second collection in the sample_restaurants database called reviews that has restaurant reviews. You can join documents from that collection to documents with the same name value in the restaurants collection using the $lookup stage. The following Review class models the documents in the reviews collection: public class Review{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_name\")]    public string RestaurantName { get; set; }\n    public string Reviewer { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"review_text\")]    public string ReviewText { get; set; }}  Select the Method Syntax or Query Syntax tab to see how to generate a $lookup stage using LINQ:  \nThe preceding example returns all documents from the restaurants collection. Each restaurant document has an added field called reviews, which contains all reviews for that restaurant. A review matches a restaurant if the value of the name field in the review document matches the name field of the restaurant document. The following is a subset of the returned results: // Results Truncated\n{ \"restaurant\" : {   \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"...\"),   \"name\" : \"The Movable Feast\",   \"restaurant_id\" : \"40361606\",

shows you how to connect to a MongoDB instance or replica set deployment using the .NET/C# Driver. \nCONNECTION URI \nA connection URI, also known as a connection string, tells the driver how to connect to a MongoDB deployment and how to behave while connected. A standard connection string includes the following pieces: Piece\nDescription\nmongodb://\nRequired. A prefix that identifies this as a string in the standard connection format.\nusername:password@\nOptional. Authentication credentials. If you include these, the client will authenticate the user against the database specified in authSource.\nhost[:port]\nRequired. The host and optional port number where MongoDB is running. If you don't include the port number, the driver will use the default port, 27017.\n/defaultauthdb\nOptional. The authentication database to use if the connection string includes username:password@ authentication credentials but not the authSource option. If you don't include this piece, the client will authenticate the user against the admin database.\n?<options>\nOptional. A query string that specifies connection-specific options as <name>=<value> pairs. See Connection Options for a full description of these options. To use a connection URI, pass it as a string to the MongoClient constructor. In the following example, the driver uses a sample connection URI to connect to a MongoDB instance on port 27017 of localhost: using MongoDB.Driver;\n// Connection URIconst string connectionUri = \"mongodb://localhost:27017\";\n// Create a new client and connect to the servervar client = new MongoClient(connectionUri);  \nTIP See the MongoDB Manual: for more information about creating a connection string. \nMONGOCLIENTSETTINGS \nYou can use a MongoClientSettings object to configure the connection in code rather than in a connection URI. To use a MongoClientSettings object, create an instance of the class and pass it as an argument to the MongoClient constructor. In the following example, the driver uses a MongoClientSettings object to connect to a MongoDB instance on port 27017 of localhost: using MongoDB.Driver;\n// Create a MongoClientSettings objectvar settings = new MongoClientSettings(){    Scheme = ConnectionStringScheme.MongoDB,    Server = new MongoServerAddress(\"localhost\", 27017)};\n// Create a new client and connect to the servervar client = new MongoClient(settings);  \nOTHER CONNECTION TARGETS  CONNECT TO ATLAS \nTo connect to a MongoDB deployment on Atlas, create a client. You can create a client that uses your connection string and other client options by passing a MongoClientSettings object to the MongoClient constructor. To specify your connection URI, pass it to the FromConnectionString() method, which returns a new MongoClientSettings instance. To specify any other client options, set the relevant fields of the MongoClientSettings object. You can set the Stable API version as a client option to avoid breaking changes when you upgrade to a new server version. To learn more about the Stable API feature, see the Stable API page. The following code shows how you can specify the connection string and the Stable API client option when connecting to a MongoDB deployment and verify that the connection is successful: using MongoDB.Driver;using MongoDB.Bson;\n// Replace the placeholders with your credentialsconst string connectionUri = \"mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.sample.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority\";\nvar settings = MongoClientSettings.FromConnectionString(connectionUri);\n// Set the ServerApi field of the settings object to Stable API version 1settings.ServerApi = new ServerApi(ServerApiVersion.V1);\n// Create a new client and connect to the servervar client = new MongoClient(settings);\n// Send a ping to confirm a successful connectiontry {    var result = client.GetDatabase(\"admin\").RunCommand<BsonDocument>(new BsonDocument(\"ping\", 1));    Console.WriteLine(\"Pinged your deployment.

Revocation Checking by Operating System\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to connect to MongoDB instances with the TLS/SSL security protocol using the underlying TLS/SSL support in the .NET framework. To configure your connection to use TLS/SSL, enable the TLS/SSL settings in either the connection string or MongoClientSettings. \nENABLE TLS \nYou can enable TLS for the connection to your MongoDB instance in two different ways: using a property on a MongoClientSettings object or through a parameter in your connection string.   CONFIGURE A CLIENT CERTIFICATE \nYou can configure your X.509 certificate using MongoClientSettings. The following code sample creates a new X.509 certificate object using the certificate file named client.p12, which is protected by the password mySuperSecretPassword. The code then adds this certificate to the SslSettings.ClientCertificates array in MongoClientSettings. var cert = new X509Certificate2(\"client.p12\", \"mySuperSecretPassword\");\nvar settings = new MongoClientSettings{   SslSettings = new SslSettings   {      ClientCertificates = new[] { cert }   },   UseTls = true};  \nIMPORTANT When loading a certificate with a password, the certificate object must contain a private key. If it doesn't, your certificate will not be passed to the server. \nALLOW INSECURE TLS \nWhen TLS is enabled, the .NET/C# Driver automatically verifies the certificate that the server presents. When testing your code, you can disable certificate verification. This is known as insecure TLS. When using insecure TLS, the only requirement is that the server present an X.509 certificate. The driver will accept a certificate even if any of the following are true:      * The hostname of the server and the subject name (or subject alternative name) on the certificate don't match.  * The certificate is expired or not yet valid.  * The certificate doesn't have a trusted root certificate in the chain.  * The certificate purpose isn't valid for server identification. You can allow insecure TLS in two different ways: using a property on a MongoClientSettings object or through a parameter in your connection string.   WARNING Always set this option to false in production. For security reasons, it's important that the server certificate is properly validated. \nCHECK CERTIFICATE REVOCATION \nWhen an X.509 certificate should no longer be trusted--for example, if its private key has been compromised--the certificate authority will revoke the certificate. By default, the .NET/C# Driver doesn't check whether a server's certificate has been revoked before it connects. You can enable revocation checking using either MongoClientSettings or the connection string.   NOTE The .NET/C# Driver doesn't check revocation by default because this is the default behavior of the SslStream class in both the .NET framework and the .NET standard. \nREVOCATION CHECKING BY OPERATING SYSTEM \nThe .NET/C# Driver supports the following revocation-checking mechanisms differently on Windows, macOS, and Linux:  * Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), a common mechanism for checking revocation  * OCSP stapling, a mechanism in which the server includes a time-stamped OCSP response to the client along with the certificate  * Certificate revocation lists (CRLs),, an alternative to OCSP WINDOWS \nOn Windows, the .NET/C# Driver supports OCSP, OCSP stapling, and CRLs without OCSP, in both the .NET Framework and .NET Core. \nWARNING On Windows, the .NET/C# Driver will report a \"hard fail\" and cancel the TLS handshake if the OCSP responder is unavailable. Other operating systems and drivers will report a \"soft fail\" and continue connecting. MACOS \nOn macOS, the .NET/C# Driver supports OCSP and OCSP stapling. Beginning with .NET Core 2.0, the driver does not support CRLs without OCSP. LINUX \nOn Linux, the .NET/C# Driver supports OCSP, OCSP stapling, and CRLs without OCSP. \nAPI DOCUMENTATION \nTo learn more about any of the connection options discussed in this guide, see the

Additional Information\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to retrieve data from your MongoDB collections with the MongoDB .NET/C# Driver. \nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this guide use the sample_restaurants.restaurants collection from the Atlas sample datasets. To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the Quick Start. The examples on this page use the following Restaurant, Address, and GradeEntry classes as models: public class Restaurant{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\")]    public string RestaurantId { get; set; }\n    public string Cuisine { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n    public string Borough { get; set; }\n    public List<GradeEntry> Grades { get; set; }}  public class Address{    public string Building { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"coord\")]    public double[] Coordinates { get; set; }\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"zipcode\")]    public string ZipCode { get; set; }}  public class GradeEntry{    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    public string Grade { get; set; }\n    public float Score { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the restaurants collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Restaurant class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. \nFIND DOCUMENTS \nUse the Find() method to retrieve documents from a collection. The Find() method takes a query filter and returns all matching documents. A query filter is an object that specifies the documents you want to retrieve in your query. To learn more about query filters, see Specify a Query. \nFIND ONE DOCUMENT \nTo find a single document in a collection, pass a query filter that specifies the criteria of the document you want to find, then chain the FirstOrDefault() or FirstOrDefaultAsync() method. If more than one document matches the query filter, these methods return the first matching document from the retrieved results. If no documents match the query filter the methods return null.   TIP \nFIRST DOCUMENT The FirstOrDefault() method returns the first document in natural order on disk if no sort criteria is specified. To see a full example of using the Find() method to find a single document, see Additional Information. \nFIND MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS \nTo find multiple documents in a collection, pass a query filter to the Find() method that specifies the criteria of the documents you want to retrieve. You can use a cursor to iterate over the documents returned by the Find() method. A cursor is a mechanism that allows an application to iterate over database results while holding only a subset of them in memory at a given time. Cursors are useful when your Find() method returns a large amount of documents. To use a cursor to iterate over the documents, pass a query filter to the Find() method that specifies the criteria of the documents you want to find, then chain the ToCursor() or ToCursorAsync() method. To view a synchronous or asynchronous example, select the corresponding tab.  \nIf you are returning a small number of documents, or need your results returned as a List object, use the ToList() or ToListAsync() methods. To find multiple documents in a collection and hold them in memory as a list, pass a query filter to the Find() method that specifies the criteria of the documents you want to find, then chain the ToList() or ToListAsync() method. To view a synchronous or asynchronous example, select the corresponding tab.  \nTo see a full example of using the Find() method to find multiple documents, see Additional Information. \nNOTE \nFIND

 To see a fully runnable example of using the Find() method to find all documents, see Additional Information. \nMODIFY FIND BEHAVIOR \nYou can modify the behavior of the Find() method by passing a FindOptions object. You can configure the commonly used options with the following methods: Method\nDescription\nBatchSize\nGets or sets the number of documents to hold in a cursor at a given time.\nCollation\nSets the collation options.\nComment\nSets the comment to the query. To learn more about query comments, see the $comment page.\nHint\nSets the hint for which index to use.\nMaxTime\nSets the maximum execution time on the server for this operation. To see a full list of available options, see FindOptions Properties. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example performs these actions:      * Finds all documents with \"Pizza\" in the cuisine field  * Sets the BatchSize to 3  * Stores the results in a cursor  * Prints the number of documents currently held in the cursor var filter = Builders<Restaurant>.Filter.Eq(\"cuisine\", \"Pizza\");\nvar findOptions = new FindOptions{   BatchSize = 3};\nusing (var cursor = _restaurantsCollection.Find(filter, findOptions).ToCursor()){   cursor.MoveNext();   Console.WriteLine($\"Number of documents in cursor: {cursor.Current.Count()}\");} \nHIDE OUTPUT Number of documents in cursor: 3 \nTIP \nCLEAN UP Create a cursor with a using statement to automatically invoke the Dispose() method once the cursor is no longer in use. \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nTo learn more about query filters, see Specify a Query. To learn how to specify queries using LINQ, see LINQ. To view runnable examples of the Find() method, see the Find a Document page. \nAPI DOCUMENTATION \nTo learn more about any of the methods or types discussed in this guide, see the following API

Operators\n * Additional Information \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to specify a query using the MongoDB .NET/C# Driver. You can narrow the set of matched documents returned by your query by creating a query filter. A query filter is an expression that specifies the documents you want to match in a read, update, or delete operation. \nNOTE \nUSING LINQ This guide shows how to specify queries using query filters. You can also specify queries using LINQ. To learn more about using LINQ, see LINQ. The examples in this guide use the following documents in a collection called guitars: { \"_id\": 1, \"make\": \"Fender\", \"models\": [\"Stratocaster\", \"Telecaster\"], \"establishedYear\": 1946, \"rating\": 9 }{ \"_id\": 2, \"make\": \"Gibson\", \"models\": [\"Les Paul\", \"SG\", \"Explorer\"], \"establishedYear\": 1902, \"rating\": 8 }{ \"_id\": 3, \"make\": \"PRS\", \"models\": [\"Silver Sky\", \"SE\", \"Custom\"], \"establishedYear\": 1985, \"rating\": 9 }{ \"_id\": 4, \"make\": \"Kiesel\", \"models\": [\"Ares\", \"Vader\", \"Solo\"], \"establishedYear\": 2015 }{ \"_id\": 5, \"make\": \"Ibanez\", \"models\": [\"RG\", \"AZ\"], \"establishedYear\": 1957, \"rating\": 7 }{ \"_id\": 6, \"make\": \"Strandberg\", \"models\": [\"Boden\", \"Salen\"], \"establishedYear\": 1982 }  The following Guitar class models the documents in this collection. public class Guitar{    public int Id { get; set; }\n    public string Make { get; set; }\n    public List<string> Models { get; set; }\n    public int EstablishedYear { get; set; }\n    public int? Rating { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the guitars collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Guitar class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. To learn more about class mapping, see Class Mapping. The following code instantiates the _guitarsCollection object using the Guitar class as a type parameter. This type parameter causes the driver to automatically serialize and deserialize the documents it sends to and receives from MongoDB to instances of the Guitar class: private static IMongoCollection<Guitar> _guitarsCollection;  \nLITERAL VALUES \nLiteral value queries return documents with an exact match to your query filter. The following example specifies a query filter as a parameter to the Find() method. The query matches all documents where the make field equals \"Fender\". var results = _guitarsCollection.Find(g => g.Make == \"Fender\").ToList();\nforeach (var doc in results){    Console.WriteLine(doc.ToBsonDocument());} \nHIDE OUTPUT { \"_id\" : 1, \"make\" : \"Fender\", \"models\" : [\"Stratocaster\", \"Telecaster\"], \"establishedYear\" : 1946, \"rating\" : 9 } The following example uses builders to create a query filter that matches the same documents as the preceding example: var filter = Builders<Guitar>.Filter.Eq(g => g.Make, \"Fender\");var result = _guitarsCollection.Find(filter).ToList();\nforeach (var doc in result){    Console.WriteLine(doc.ToBsonDocument());} \nHIDE OUTPUT { \"_id\" : 1, \"make\" : \"Fender\", \"models\" : [\"Stratocaster\", \"Telecaster\"], \"establishedYear\" : 1946, \"rating\" : 9 } \nTIP \nFIND ALL DOCUMENTS Use an empty query filter to match all documents in the collection. Create an empty query filter with builders as follows: var result = _guitarsCollection.Find(Builders<Guitar>.Filter.Empty).ToList();  To learn more about using builders, see Operations with Builders.

The query matches all documents where the establishedYear field is greater than or equal to 1985, and the make field is not equal to \"Kiesel\". var results = _guitarsCollection.Find(g => g.EstablishedYear >= 1985 && r.Make != \"Kiesel\").ToList();\nforeach (var doc in results){    Console.WriteLine(doc.ToBsonDocument());} \nHIDE OUTPUT { \"_id\" : 3, \"make\" : \"PRS\", \"models\" : [\"Silver Sky\", \"SE\", \"Custom\"], \"establishedYear\" : 1985, \"rating\" : 9 } The following example uses builders to create a query filter that matches the same documents as the preceding example: var builder = Builders<Guitar>.Filter;var filter = builder.And(builder.Gte(g => g.EstablishedYear, 1985), builder.Ne(r => r.Make, \"Kiesel\"));var result = _guitarsCollection.Find(filter).ToList();\nforeach (var doc in result){    Console.WriteLine(doc.ToBsonDocument());} \nHIDE OUTPUT { \"_id\" : 3, \"make\" : \"PRS\", \"models\" : [\"Silver Sky\", \"SE\", \"Custom\"], \"establishedYear\" : 1985, \"rating\" : 9 } To learn more about using builders, see Operations with Builders. \nARRAY OPERATORS \nArray operators match documents based on the value or quantity of elements in an array field. The following is a list of builder methods that use array operators: Operator\nDescription\nAll()\nMatches documents if the array field contains all elements specified in the query.\nAny()\nMatches documents if any element in the array field matches the specified query filter.\nSize()\nMatches documents if the array field is a specified size. \nNOTE The Any() builder uses the $elemMatch query operator. To learn more about the $elemMatch query selector, see $elemMatch. For more information on the array operators, see the Array Query Operators page. The following example uses builders to create a query filter that matches all documents that have 3 elements in the models field: var filter = Builders<Guitar>.Filter.Size(g => g.Models, 3);var result

To learn more about using builders, see Operations with Builders. \nELEMENT OPERATORS \nElement operators query data based on the presence or type of a field. For a full list of element operators, see the Element Query Operators page. The following example uses builders to create a query filter that matches all documents that have a rating field: var filter = Builders<Guitar>.Filter.Exists(g => g.Rating);var result = _guitarsCollection.Find(filter).ToList();\nforeach (var doc in result){    Console.WriteLine(doc.ToBsonDocument());} \nHIDE OUTPUT { \"_id\" : 1, \"make\" : \"Fender\", \"models\" : [\"Stratocaster\", \"Telecaster\"], \"establishedYear\" : 1946, \"rating\" : 9 }{ \"_id\" : 2, \"make\" : \"Gibson\", \"models\" : [\"Les Paul\", \"SG\", \"Explorer\"], \"establishedYear\" : 1902, \"rating\" : 8 }{ \"_id\" : 3, \"make\" : \"PRS\", \"models\" : [\"Silver Sky\", \"SE\", \"Custom\"], \"establishedYear\" : 1985, \"rating\" : 9 }{ \"_id\" : 5, \"make\" : \"Ibanez\", \"models\" : [\"RG\", \"AZ\"], \"establishedYear\" : 1957, \"rating\" : 7 } To learn more about using builders, see Operations with Builders. \nEVALUATION OPERATORS \nEvaluation operators analyze data on individual fields, or on the entire collection's documents. Some builder methods that use evaluation operators include Regex() and Text(). For a full list of evaluation operators, see the Evaluation Query Operators page. The following example uses builders to create a query filter that matches all documents that have a value in the make field that starts with the letter \"G\": var filter = Builders<Guitar>.Filter.Regex(g => g.Make, \"^G\");var result = _guitarsCollection.Find(filter).ToList();\nforeach (var doc in result){    Console.WriteLine(doc.ToBsonDocument());} \nHIDE OUTPUT { \"_id\" : 2, \"make\" : \"Gibson\", \"models\" : [\"Les Paul\", \"SG\", \"Explorer\"], \"establishedYear\" : 1902, \"rating\" : 8 } To learn more about using builders, see Operations with Builders. \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nFor more information about the operators mentioned in this guide, see the following Server Manual Entries:      * Comparison Query Operators  * Logical Query Operators  * Array Query Operators  * Element Query Operators  * Evaluation Query Operators To learn more about using Builders, see Operations with Builders.

Docs Home → C#/.NET \nCHANGE DOCUMENTS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Sample Data\n * Update Operations\n * Required Parameters\n * Update One Document\n * Update Many Documents\n * Customize the Update Operation\n * Return Value\n * Example\n * Replace Operation\n * Required Parameters\n * Customize the Replace Operation\n * Return Value\n * Example\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to change documents in a MongoDB collection using two different kinds of operations:      * Update  * Replace \nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this guide use the restaurants collection from the sample_restaurants database. The documents in this collection use the following Restaurant, Address, and GradeEntry classes as models: public class Restaurant{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\")]    public string RestaurantId { get; set; }\n    public string Cuisine { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n    public string Borough { get; set; }\n    public List<GradeEntry> Grades { get; set; }}  public class Address{    public string Building { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"coord\")]    public double[] Coordinates { get; set; }\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"zipcode\")]    public string ZipCode { get; set; }}  public class GradeEntry{    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    public string Grade { get; set; }\n    public float Score { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the restaurants collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Restaurant class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. This collection is from the sample datasets provided by Atlas. See the Quick Start to learn how to create a free MongoDB cluster and load this sample data. \nUPDATE OPERATIONS \nYou can perform update operations in MongoDB with the following methods:  * UpdateOne(), which updates the first document that matches the search criteria  * UpdateMany(), which updates all documents that match the search criteria \nREQUIRED PARAMETERS \nEach update method requires the following parameters:  * A query filter document, which determines which records to update. See the MongoDB server manual for more information about query filters.  * An update document, which specifies the update operator (the kind of update to perform) and the fields and values that should change. See the Field Update Operators Manual page for a complete list of update operators and their usage. The .NET/C# Driver provides a Builders class that simplifies the creation of both query filters and update documents. The following code sample uses Builders to create two documents for use as parameters in an update operation:  * A query filter that searches for restaurants with a borough field value of \"Manhattan\"  * An update document that sets the value of the borough field of these restaurants to \"Manhattan (north)\" var filter = Builders<Restaurant>.Filter    .Eq(restaurant => restaurant.Borough, \"Manhattan\");\nvar update = Builders<Restaurant>.Update    .Set(restaurant => restaurant.Borough, \"Manhattan (north)\");  \nTIP \nAGGREGATION PIPELINES IN UPDATE OPERATIONS If you are using MongoDB Version 4.2 or later, you can use aggregation pipelines made up of a subset of aggregation stages in update operations. For more information on the aggregation stages MongoDB supports in aggregation pipelines used in update operations, see our tutorial on building updates with aggregation pipelines. \nUPDATE ONE DOCUMENT \nThe following code shows how to use the asynchronous UpdateOneAsync() method or the synchronous UpdateOne() method to update one document.   UPDATE MANY DOCUMENTS \nThe following code shows how to use the asynchronous UpdateManyAsync() method or the synchronous UpdateMany() method to update all matched documents.

The UpdateOptions type allows you to configure options with the following properties: Property\nDescription\nArrayFilters\nSpecifies which array elements to modify for an update operation on an array field. See the MongoDB server manual for more information.\nBypassDocumentValidation\nSpecifies whether the update operation bypasses document validation. This lets you update documents that don't meet the schema validation requirements, if any exist. See the MongoDB server manual for more information on schema validation.\nCollation\nSpecifies the kind of language collation to use when sorting results. See the MongoDB server manual for more information on collation.\nComment\nGets or sets the user-provided comment for the operation. See the MongoDB server manual for more information.\nHint\nGets or sets the index to use to scan for documents. See the MongoDB server manual for more information.\nIsUpsert\nSpecifies whether the update operation performs an upsert operation if no documents match the query filter. See the MongoDB server manual for more information.\nLet\nGets or sets the let document. See the MongoDB server manual for more information. \nRETURN VALUE \nThe UpdateOne() and UpdateMany() methods each return an UpdateResult object. The UpdateResult type contains the following properties: Property\nDescription\nIsAcknowledged\nIndicates whether the update operation was acknowledged by MongoDB.\nIsModifiedCountAvailable\nIndicates whether you can read the count of updated records on the UpdateResult.\nMatchedCount\nThe number of documents that matched the query filter, regardless of how many were updated.\nModifiedCount\nThe number of documents updated by the update operation. If an updated document is identical to the original, it won't be included in this count.\nUpsertedId\nThe ID of the document that was upserted in the database, if the driver performed an upsert. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following code uses the UpdateMany() method to find all documents where the borough field has the value \"Manhattan\", then updates the borough value in these documents to \"Manhattan (north)\". Because the IsUpsert option is set to true, the driver inserts a new document if the query filter doesn't match any existing documents.   var filter = Builders<Restaurant>.Filter      .Eq(restaurant => restaurant.Borough, \"Manhattan\");\n  var update = Builders<Restaurant>.Update      .Set(restaurant => restaurant.Borough, \"Manhattan (north)\");\n  UpdateOptions opts = new UpdateOptions()  {      Comment = new BsonString(\"Borough updated for C# Driver Fundamentals\"),      IsUpsert = true  };\n  Console.WriteLine(\"Updating documents...\");  var result = _restaurantsCollection.UpdateMany(filter, update, opts);\n  Console.WriteLine($\"Updated documents: {result.ModifiedCount}\");  Console.WriteLine($\"Result acknowledged? {result.IsAcknowledged}\"); \nVIEW OUTPUT \nNOTE If the preceding example used the UpdateOne() method instead of UpdateMany(), the driver would update only the first of the matched documents. \nREPLACE OPERATION \nYou can perform a replace operation in MongoDB with the ReplaceOne() method. This method removes all fields (except the _id field) from the first document that matches the search criteria, then inserts the fields and values you specify into the document. \nREQUIRED PARAMETERS \nThe ReplaceOne() method requires the following parameters:  * A query filter document, which determines which record to replace.  * A replacement document, which specifies the fields and values to insert in the new document. If the documents in your collection are mapped to a C# class, the replacement document can be an instance of this class. Like in an update operation, you can use the Builders class in the .NET/C# Driver to create a query filter. The following code sample uses Builders to create a query filter that searches for restaurants with a name field value of \"Pizza Town\".

 \nIMPORTANT The values of _id fields are immutable. If your replacement document specifies a value for the _id field, it must match the _id value of the existing document. The following code shows how to use the asynchronous ReplaceOneAsync() method or the synchronous ReplaceOne() method to replace one document.   TIP Find runnable examples that use these methods under Additional Information. \nCUSTOMIZE THE REPLACE OPERATION \nThe ReplaceOne() method optionally accepts a ReplaceOptions object as an additional parameter, which represents options you can use to configure the replace operation. If you don't specify any ReplaceOptions properties, the driver does not customize the replace operation. The ReplaceOptions type allows you to configure options with the following properties: Property\nDescription\nBypassDocumentValidation\nSpecifies whether the replace operation bypasses document validation. This lets you replace documents that don't meet the schema validation requirements, if any exist. See the MongoDB server manual for more information on schema validation.\nCollation\nSpecifies the kind of language collation to use when sorting results. See the MongoDB server manual for more information on collation.\nComment\nGets or sets the user-provided comment for the operation. See the MongoDB server manual for more information.\nHint\nGets or sets the index to use to scan for documents. See the MongoDB server manual for more information.\nIsUpsert\nSpecifies whether the replace operation performs an upsert operation if no documents match the query filter. See the MongoDB server manual for more information.\nLet\nGets or sets the let document. See the MongoDB server manual for more information. \nRETURN VALUE \nThe ReplaceOne() method returns a ReplaceOneResult object. The ReplaceOneResult type contains the following properties: Property\nDescription\nIsAcknowledged\nIndicates whether the replace operation was acknowledged by MongoDB.\nIsModifiedCountAvailable\nIndicates whether you can read the count of replaced records on the ReplaceOneResult.\nMatchedCount\nThe number of documents that matched the query filter, regardless of whether one was replaced.\nModifiedCount\nThe number of documents replaced by the replace operation.\nUpsertedId\nThe ID of the document that was upserted in the database, if the driver performed an upsert. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following code uses the ReplaceOne() method to find the first document where the name field has the value \"Pizza Town\", then replaces this document with a new Restaurant document named \"Food World\". Because the IsUpsert option is set to true, the driver inserts a new document if the query filter doesn't match any existing documents. var filter = Builders<Restaurant>.Filter.Eq(restaurant =>

Docs Home → C#/.NET \nCONNECTION OPTIONS \nOn this page    \n * Using the Connection URI\n   \n * Using MongoClientSettings\n * Connection Options This section describes the MongoDB connection and authentication options available in the .NET/C# Driver. You can configure your connection using either the connection URI or a MongoClientSettings object. \nUSING THE CONNECTION URI \nIf you pass a connection URI to the MongoClient constructor, you can include connection options in the string as <name>=<value> pairs. In the following example, the connection URI contains the connectTimeoutMS option with a value of 60000 and the tls option with a value of true: using MongoDB.Driver;\n// Connection URIconst string connectionUri = \"mongodb+srv://sample.host:27017/?connectTimeoutMS=60000&tls=true\";\n// Create a new client and connect to the servervar client = new MongoClient(connectionUri);  \nUSING MONGOCLIENTSETTINGS \nYou can use a MongoClientSettings object to configure connection settings in code rather than in a connection URI. Configuring the connection this way makes it easier to change settings at runtime, helps you catch errors during compilation, and provides more configuration options than the connection URI. To use a MongoClientSettings object, create an instance of the class, set its properties, and pass it as an argument to the MongoClient constructor: //const string connectionUri = \"mongodb+srv://sample.host:27017/?connectTimeoutMS=60000&tls=true\";\n// Create a MongoClientSettings objectvar settings = new MongoClientSettings(){    Scheme = ConnectionStringScheme.MongoDBPlusSrv,    Server = new MongoServerAddress(\"sample.host\", 27017),    ConnectTimeout = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 60),    UseTls = true};\n// Create a new client and connect to the servervar client = new MongoClient(settings);  \nCONNECTION OPTIONS \nThe following table lists each connection option available in the MongoClientSettings class and, if possible, how to achieve the same result in the connection string. If a MongoClientSettings property maps to more than one option in the connection string, the Connection URI Example shows all relevant options. \nNOTE If you're using a query parameter for a time duration, the value must be in milliseconds. For example, to specify 60 seconds, use the value 60000. If you're using a MongoClientSettings object for a time duration, use the appropriate TimeSpan value. MongoClientSettings Property\nDescription\nAllowInsecureTls\nSpecifies whether to relax TLS constraints as much as possible.

If a server's round trip takes longer\nthan the fastest server's round-trip time plus this value, the server isn't\neligible for selection. \nData Type: TimeSpan\nDefault: 15 milliseconds\nConnection URI Example: localThresholdMS=0\nLoggingSettings\nThe settings used for logging. \nData Type: LoggingSettings\nDefault: null\nConnection URI Example: N/A\nMaxConnecting\nThe greatest number of connections a driver's connection pool may be\nestablishing concurrently. \nData Type: integer\nDefault: 2\nConnection URI Example: maxConnecting=3\nMaxConnectionIdleTime\nThe length of time a connection can be idle before the driver closes it. \nData Type: TimeSpan\nDefault: 10 minutes\nConnection URI Example: maxIdleTimeMS=300000\nMaxConnectionLifeTime\nThe length of time a connection can be pooled before expiring. \nData Type: TimeSpan\nDefault: 30 minutes\nConnection URI Example: maxLifetimeMS=50000\nMaxConnectionPoolSize\nThe greatest number of clients or connections the driver can create in its\nconnection pool. This count includes connections in use. \nData Type: integer\nDefault: 100\nConnection URI Example: maxPoolSize=150\nMinConnectionPoolSize\nThe number of connections the driver should create and keep in the connection\npool even when no operations are occurring. This count includes connections\nin use. \nData Type: integer\nDefault: 0\nConnection URI Example: minPoolSize=1\nReadConcern\nThe client's default read concern.\nSee read concern for more information. \nData Type: ReadConcern\nDefault: ReadConcern.Default\nConnection URI Example: readConcernLevel=local\nReadEncoding\nThe UTF-8 encoding to use for string deserialization.\nStrict encoding will throw an exception when an invalid UTF-8 byte sequence\nis encountered. \nData Type: UTF8Encoding\nDefault: Strict encoding\nConnection URI Example: N/A\nReadPreference\nThe client's default read-preference settings. MaxStaleness represents the\nlongest replication lag, in wall-clock time, that a secondary can experience and\nstill be eligible for server selection. Specifying -1 means no maximum.\nSee read preference for more information. \nData Type: ReadPreference\nDefault: ReadPreference.Primary\nConnection URI Example:

Return Value\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to remove documents from your MongoDB collections using delete operations. \nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this guide use the restaurants collection from the sample_restaurants database. The documents in this collection use the following Restaurant, Address, and GradeEntry classes as models: public class Restaurant{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\")]    public string RestaurantId { get; set; }\n    public string Cuisine { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n    public string Borough { get; set; }\n    public List<GradeEntry> Grades { get; set; }}  public class Address{    public string Building { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"coord\")]    public double[] Coordinates { get; set; }\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"zipcode\")]    public string ZipCode { get; set; }}  public class GradeEntry{    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    public string Grade { get; set; }\n    public float Score { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the restaurants collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Restaurant class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. This collection is from the sample datasets provided by Atlas. See the Quick Start to learn how to create a free MongoDB cluster and load this sample data. \nDELETE OPERATIONS \nUse delete operations to remove documents that match a query filter. The query filter determines which records are selected for deletion based on the criteria in the query filter document. You can perform delete operations in MongoDB with the following methods:      * DeleteOne(), which deletes the first document that matches the query filter  * DeleteMany(), which deletes all documents that match the query filter \nDELETE ONE DOCUMENT \nThe following code shows how to use the asynchronous DeleteOneAsync() method or the synchronous DeleteOne() method to delete one document.   DELETE MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS \nThe following code shows how to use the asynchronous DeleteManyAsync() method or the synchronous DeleteMany() method to delete all matched documents.   TIP Find runnable examples using these methods under additional information. \nPARAMETERS \nThe DeleteOne() and DeleteMany() methods require you to pass a query filter specifying which documents to match. More information on how to construct a query filter is available in the Query Documents tutorial. Both methods optionally take a DeleteOptions type as an additional parameter, which represents options you can use to configure the delete operation. If you don't specify any DeleteOptions properties, the driver does not customize the delete operation. The DeleteOptions type allows you to configure options with the following properties: Property\nDescription\nCollation\nGets or sets the type of language collation to use when sorting results. See the delete statements for more information.\nComment\nGets or sets the comment for the operation. See the delete command fields for more information.\nHint\nGets or sets the index to use to scan for documents. See the delete statements for more information.\nLet\nGets or sets the let document. See the delete command fields for more information. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following code uses the DeleteMany() method to search on the \"borough_1\" index and delete all documents where the address.street field value includes the phrase \"Pearl Street\": var filter = Builders<Restaurant>.Filter    .Regex(\"address.street\", \"Pearl Street\");\nDeleteOptions opts = new DeleteOptions { Hint = \"borough_1\" };\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Deleting documents...\");var result = _restaurantsCollection.DeleteMany(filter, opts);\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Deleted documents:

Parameters\n * Example\n * Ordered Behavior\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to add documents to your MongoDB collections using insert operations. \nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this guide use the restaurants collection from the sample_restaurants database. The documents in this collection use the following Restaurant, Address, and GradeEntry classes as models: public class Restaurant{    public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"restaurant_id\")]    public string RestaurantId { get; set; }\n    public string Cuisine { get; set; }\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\n    public string Borough { get; set; }\n    public List<GradeEntry> Grades { get; set; }}  public class Address{    public string Building { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"coord\")]    public double[] Coordinates { get; set; }\n    public string Street { get; set; }\n    [BsonElement(\"zipcode\")]    public string ZipCode { get; set; }}  public class GradeEntry{    public DateTime Date { get; set; }\n    public string Grade { get; set; }\n    public float Score { get; set; }}  \nNOTE The documents in the restaurants collection use the camel-case naming convention. The examples in this guide use a ConventionPack to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to the properties in the Restaurant class. To learn more about custom serialization, see Custom Serialization. This collection is from the sample datasets provided by Atlas. See the Quick Start to learn how to create a free MongoDB cluster and load this sample data. \nTHE _ID FIELD \nIn a MongoDB collection, each document must contain an _id field with a unique field value. MongoDB allows you to manage this field in two ways:      * You can set this field for each document yourself, ensuring each _id field value is unique.  * You can let the driver automatically generate unique ObjectId values for each document _id. If you do not manually set an _id field value for a document, the driver will populate the field with an ObjectId. Unless you can guarantee uniqueness, MongoDB recommends you let the driver automatically generate _id values. \nNOTE Duplicate _id values violate unique index constraints, which causes the driver to return a MongoWriteException from InsertOne() or a MongoBulkWriteException from InsertMany(). To learn more about the _id field, see the Server Manual Entry on Unique Indexes. To learn more about document structure and rules, see the Server Manual Entry on Documents. \nINSERT OPERATIONS \nUse insert operations to add documents to a collection. You can perform inserts in MongoDB with the following methods:  * InsertOne(), which inserts a single document  * InsertMany(), which inserts multiple documents stored in an IEnumerable interface \nINSERT ONE DOCUMENT \nThe following code shows how to use the asynchronous InsertOneAsync() method or the synchronous InsertOne() method to insert one document.   INSERT MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS \nThe following code shows how to use the asynchronous InsertManyAsync() method or the synchronous InsertMany() method to insert multiple documents.   TIP Find runnable examples using these methods under additional information. \nPARAMETERS \nThe InsertOne() method takes the document you seek to insert as a parameter. The InsertMany() method takes an IEnumerable collection of documents, such as a list or array, as a parameter. The InsertOne() method optionally takes a InsertOneOptions type as an additional parameter, which represents options you can use to configure the insert operation. If you don't specify any InsertOneOptions properties, the driver does not customize the insert. The InsertOneOptions type allows you to configure options with the following properties: Property\nDescription\nBypassDocumentValidation\nGets or sets a value indicating whether to bypass document validation. If true, allows the write to opt-out of document level validation.\nComment\nGets or sets the comment for the operation.

Property\nDescription\nIsOrdered\nGets or sets a value indicating whether the requests are fulfilled in order. If true, the driver sends documents to the server in the order provided. If an error occurs, the driver and server abort all remaining insert operations. To learn more, see Ordered Behavior.\nDefault: true \nEXAMPLE \nThe following code uses the InsertMany() method to insert four new Restaurant documents into a collection with BypassDocumentValidation set to true: var restaurantsList = new List<Restaurant>(){    new() { Name = \"Été Bleu\", Cuisine = \"French\" },    new() { Name = \"Lucky Bird\", Cuisine = \"Café/Coffee/Tea\" },    new() { Name = \"Wildflower Café\", Cuisine = \"Vegetarian\" },    new() { Name = \"Blue Moon Grill\", Cuisine = \"American\" },};\nvar options = new InsertManyOptions() { BypassDocumentValidation = true };\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Inserting documents...\");_restaurantsCollection.InsertMany(restaurantsList, options);  The InsertMany() method has no return value. You can verify that your documents were successfully inserted by executing a Find() operation on the collection. For an example on how to find a document, see Find a Document. \nORDERED BEHAVIOR \nAssume you want to insert the following documents: { \"_id\" : 1, \"name\" : \"Restaurant A\" }{ \"_id\" : 2, \"name\" : \"Restaurant B\" }{ \"_id\" : 1, \"name\" : \"Restaurant C\" }{ \"_id\" : 3, \"name\" : \"Restaurant D\" } If you attempt to insert these documents with default InsertManyOptions, the driver throws a MongoBulkWriteException at the third document because of the repeated _id value, but the documents before the error-producing document are still inserted into your collection. If you look inside your collection, you should be able to see the following documents: { \"_id\" : 1, \"name\" : \"Restaurant A\" }{ \"_id\" : 2, \"name\" : \"Restaurant B\" } If you set IsOrdered to false in your insert operation, the driver will continue to insert your documents even if some documents produce errors. With this modified insert behavior, the driver throws an exception but inserts all documents that do not produce errors.
