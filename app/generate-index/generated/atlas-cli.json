The Atlas CLI accepts .json cluster configuration files. Use the following resources to:      * Learn the required settings you can specify in the cluster configuration file.  * View and copy sample configuration files. \nREQUIRED CLUSTER SETTINGS \nAtlas requires the following settings to create a cluster with the Atlas CLI. You must specify these cluster settings either in the configuration file or as flags in the command: Field\nType\nDescription\nclusterType\nstring\nHuman-readable label that indicates the type of cluster to create. Values include: REPLICASET, SHARDED, or GEOSHARDED.\nname\nstring\nHuman-readable label that identifies the cluster.\nreplicationSpecs\narray\nList that contains the configuration settings for your cluster regions and the hardware provisioned in them.\nreplicationSpecs. regionConfigs\narray List that contains the hardware specifications for the nodes set within the region that you specify. Each regionConfigs object describes the region's priority in elections and the number and type of MongoDB nodes that Atlas deploys to the region. Each regionConfigs object must have either an analyticsSpecs object, electableSpecs object, or readOnlySpecs object.  * Shared clusters require only electableSpecs.  * Dedicated clusters can specify any of these specifications, but must have at least one electableSpecs object within a replicationSpec.  * Every hardware specification must use the same instanceSize. replicationSpecs. regionConfigs.electableSpecs\nobject\nHardware specifications for electable nodes in the region. Electable nodes can become the primary and can enable local reads.\nreplicationSpecs. regionConfigs. electableSpecs.instanceSize\nstring\nHardware specification for the instance sizes in this region. To learn more, see Select Cluster Tier.\nreplicationSpecs .regionConfigs. electableSpecs.nodeCount\nnumber Number of electable nodes for Atlas to deploy to the region. Electable nodes can become the primary and can enable local reads. The combined electableSpecs.nodeCount across all replicationSpecs[n].regionConfigs[m] objects must total 3, 5, or 7. replicationSpecs. regionConfigs.priority\nInteger Precedence that is given to this region when a primary election occurs. If your region has set electableSpecs.nodeCount to 1 or higher, it must have a priority of exactly one (1) less than another region in the replicationSpecs[n].regionConfigs[m] array. The highest-priority region must have a priority of 7. The lowest possible priority is 1. The priority 7 region identifies the preferred region of the cluster. Atlas places the primary node in the preferred region. replicationSpecs. regionConfigs.providerName\nstring Human-readable label that identifies your cloud service provider. Values include: AWS, AZURE, or GCP. To create a multi-cloud cluster, specify more than one service provider for your regionConfigs objects. To learn more, see the multi-cloud example configuration file replicationSpecs. regionConfigs.regionName\nstring Human-readable label that indicates the physical location of your cluster nodes. The region you choose can affect network latency for clients accessing your databases. For a complete list of region name values, refer to the the cloud provider reference pages:  * AWS  * GCP  * Azure \nOPTIONAL AND CONDITIONAL CLUSTER SETTINGS \nYour cluster configuration file may contain additional optional or conditional cluster settings. If you selected a clusterType of GEOSHARDED, you must specify the following cluster settings either in the configuration file or as flags in the command: Field\nType\nDescription\nreplicationSpecs. numShards\nstring Positive integer that specifies the number of shards to deploy in each specified zone. Provide this value if you set a clusterType of SHARDED or GEOSHARDED. Omit this value if you selected a clusterType of REPLICASET. This API resource accepts 1 through 50, inclusive. This parameter defaults to 1. If you specify a numShards value of 1 and a clusterType of SHARDED, Atlas deploys a single-shard sharded
