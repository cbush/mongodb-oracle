Atlas Data Lake is now called Atlas Data Federation. To learn more about the renamed federated query engine service, see Atlas Data Federation. You can create Atlas Data Lake pipelines using the Atlas UI and Data Lake Pipelines API. This page guides you through the steps for creating an Atlas Data Lake pipeline. \nPREREQUISITES \nBefore you begin, you must have the following:      * Backup-enabled M10 or higher Atlas cluster.  * Project Owner role for the project for which you want to deploy a Data Lake.  * Sample data loaded on your cluster (if you wish to try the example in the following Create a Pipeline from the Atlas UI). \nCREATE A PIPELINE FROM THE ATLAS UI \n1 \nNAVIGATE TO ATLAS DATA LAKE IN THE ATLAS UI. \nTo navigate to the Atlas Data Lake page:  a. Log in to MongoDB Atlas.  b. Select Data Lake under Deployment on the left-hand navigation panel. 2 \nCLICK ADD DATA LAKE PIPELINE. \n3 \nDEFINE THE DATA SOURCE FOR THE PIPELINE. \nYou can create a copy of data on your Atlas cluster in MongoDB-managed cloud object storage optimized for analytic queries with workload isolation. To set up a pipeline, specify the following in the Setup Pipeline page:  a. Select the Atlas cluster from the dropdown.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    If you loaded the sample data on your cluster, select the Atlas cluster where you loaded the sample data.  b. Select the database on the specified cluster from the dropdown.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    If you selected the cluster where the sample data is loaded, select sample_mflix.  c. Select the collection in the specified database from the dropdown.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    If you selected the sample_mflix database, select the movies collection in the sample_mflix database.  d. Enter a name for the pipeline.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    If you are following the examples in this tutorial, enter sample_mflix.movies in the Pipeline Name field.  e. Click Continue. 4 \nSPECIFY AN INGESTION SCHEDULE FOR YOUR CLUSTER DATA. \nYou can specify how frequently your cluster data is extracted from your Atlas Backup Snapshots and ingested into Data Lake Datasets. Each snapshot represents your data at that point in time, which is stored in a workload isolated, analytic storage. You can query any snapshot data in the Data Lake datasets. You can choose Basic Schedule or On Demand.  5 \nSELECT THE AWS REGION FOR STORING YOUR EXTRACTED DATA. \nAtlas Data Lake provides optimized storage in the following AWS regions: Data Lake Regions\nAWS Regions\nVirginia, USA\nus-east-1\nOregon, USA\nus-west-2\nSao Paulo, Brazil\nsa-east-1\nIreland\neu-west-1\nLondon, England\neu-west-2\nFrankfurt, Germany\neu-central-1\nMumbai, India\nap-south-1\nSingapore\nap-southeast-1\nSydney, Australia\nap-southeast-2 By default, Atlas Data Lake automatically selects the region closest to your Atlas cluster for storing extracted data. 6 \nSPECIFY FIELDS IN YOUR COLLECTION TO CREATE PARTITIONS. \nEnter the most commonly queried fields from the collection in the Partition Attributes section. To specify nested fields, use the dot notation. Do not include quotes (\"\") around nested fields that you specify using dot notation. You can't specify fields inside an array. The specified fields are used to partition your data. \nWARNING You can't specify field names that contain periods (.) for
