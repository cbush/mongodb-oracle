Docs Home → MongoDB Atlas Data Lake \nCREATE AN ATLAS DATA LAKE PIPELINE \nOn this page    \n * Prerequisites\n   \n * Create a Pipeline from the Atlas UI\n * Create a Pipeline from the API\n * Next steps Looking for documentation for what used to be called \"Atlas Data Lake\"? Atlas Data Lake is now called Atlas Data Federation. To learn more about the renamed federated query engine service, see Atlas Data Federation. You can create Atlas Data Lake pipelines using the Atlas UI and Data Lake Pipelines API. This page guides you through the steps for creating an Atlas Data Lake pipeline. \nPREREQUISITES \nBefore you begin, you must have the following:      * Backup-enabled M10 or higher Atlas cluster.  * Project Owner role for the project for which you want to deploy a Data Lake.  * Sample data loaded on your cluster (if you wish to try the example in the following Create a Pipeline from the Atlas UI). \nCREATE A PIPELINE FROM THE ATLAS UI \n1 \nNAVIGATE TO ATLAS DATA LAKE IN THE ATLAS UI. \nTo navigate to the Atlas Data Lake page:  a. Log in to MongoDB Atlas.  b. Select Data Lake under Deployment on the left-hand navigation panel. 2 \nCLICK ADD DATA LAKE PIPELINE. \n3 \nDEFINE THE DATA SOURCE FOR THE PIPELINE. \nYou can create a copy of data on your Atlas cluster in MongoDB-managed cloud object storage optimized for analytic queries with workload isolation. To set up a pipeline, specify the following in the Setup Pipeline page:  a. Select the Atlas cluster from the dropdown.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    If you loaded the sample data on your cluster, select the Atlas cluster where you loaded the sample data.  b. Select the database on the specified cluster from the dropdown.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    If you selected the cluster where the sample data is loaded, select sample_mflix.  c.

\nEXAMPLE Enter year in the Most commonly queried field field and title in the Second most commonly queried field field. Atlas Data Lake optimizes performance for the year field, followed by the title field. If you configure a Federated Database Instance for your Data Lake dataset, Atlas Data Federation optimizes performance for queries on the following fields:  * the year field, and  * the year field and the title field. Atlas Data Federation can also support a query on the title field only. However, in this case, Atlas Data Federation wouldn't be as efficient in supporting the query as it would be if the query were on the title field only. Performance is optimized in order; if a query omits a particular partition, Atlas Data Federation is less efficient in making use of any partitions that follow that. You can run Atlas Data Federation queries on fields not specified here, but Atlas Data Lake is less efficient in processing such queries. 7 \n(OPTIONAL) SPECIFY FIELDS INSIDE YOUR DOCUMENTS TO EXCLUDE. \nBy default, Atlas Data Lake extracts and stores all fields inside the documents in your collection. To specify fields to exclude:  a. Click Add Field.  b. Enter field name in the Add Transformation Field Name window.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    (Optional) Enter fullplot to exclude the field named fullplot in the movies collection.  c. Click Done.  d. Repeat steps for each field you wish to exclude. To remove a field from this list, click . 8 \nCLICK FINISH TO CREATE THE DATA LAKE.  CREATE A PIPELINE FROM THE API \nTo create an Atlas Data Lake pipeline through the API, send a POST request to the Data Lake pipelines endpoint. To learn more about the pipelines endpoint syntax and parameters for creating a pipeline, see Create One Data Lake Pipeline. \nTIP You can send a GET request to the Data Lake availableSchedules endpoint to retrieve the list of backup schedule policy items that you can use to create your Data Lake pipeline of type PERIODIC_DPS. \nNEXT STEPS \nNow that you've created your Data Lake pipeline,

Docs Home → MongoDB Atlas Data Lake \nTRIGGER DATA INGESTION ON DEMAND \nYou can manually trigger an ingestion of snapshot data from the Atlas cluster to Atlas Data Lake datasets if you configured On Demand extraction in your Data Lake pipeline. You can trigger data ingestion from the Atlas UI and Data Lake Pipelines API. \nTRIGGER DATA INGESTION FROM THE ATLAS UI \n1 \nLOG IN TO MONGODB ATLAS. \n2 \nSELECT DATA LAKE UNDER DEPLOYMENT ON THE LEFT-HAND NAVIGATION. \n3 \nCLICK THE VERTICAL ELLIPSIS () FOR THE DATA LAKE FOR WHICH YOU CONFIGURED ON DEMAND INGESTION AND SELECT TRIGGER AN ON DEMAND PIPELINE RUN. \n4 \nSELECT THE SNAPSHOT, FROM WHICH TO INGEST DATA, FROM THE DROPDOWN. \nThe dropdown shows a list of all the snapshots on your Atlas cluster. However, you can select only the snapshots from which Data Lake hasn't yet ingested data; the grayed-out snapshots are snapshots from which your Data Lake has already ingested data. You can also send a GET request to the Data Lake availableSnapshots endpoint to retrieve the list of backup snapshots that you can use to trigger an on-demand pipeline run. To learn more about the API syntax and options for the availableSnapshots endpoint, see Return Available Backup Snapshots for One Data Lake Pipeline. 5 \nCLICK CONFIRM. \nAtlas displays a blue banner at the top of the page that shows the data ingestion status. \nTRIGGER DATA INGESTION FROM THE API \nTo trigger data ingestion through the API, send a POST request to the Data Lake trigger endpoint with the name of the pipeline for which you want to trigger data ingestion. To learn more about the API syntax and parameters for the trigger endpoint, see Trigger On-Demand Snapshot Ingestion. \nTIP You can send a GET request to the Data Lake availableSnapshots endpoint to retrieve the list of backup snapshots that you can use to trigger an on-demand pipeline run.

Docs Home → MongoDB Atlas Data Lake \nVIEW ATLAS DATA LAKE PIPELINES \nYou can view all of your Data Lake pipelines through the Atlas UI and Data Lake Pipelines API. You can also retrieve all of your completed Data Lake pipeline data ingestion jobs from the API. \nVIEW ATLAS DATA LAKE PIPELINES FROM THE ATLAS UI \n1 \nLOG IN TO MONGODB ATLAS. \n2 \nSELECT DATA LAKE UNDER DEPLOYMENT ON THE LEFT-HAND NAVIGATION. \nThe page displays all the Data Lake pipelines in the project. For each Data Lake pipeline, the service also displays the following information: Column Name\nDescription\nPipeline Name\nName of your Data Lake pipeline. Each pipeline can produce multiple datasets. You can expand the name to view the datasets in the pipeline.\nData Source\nSource for the data in the pipeline datasets. For data from a collection on the Atlas cluster, this column shows the cluster name, the database name, and the collection name separated by |.\nData Size\nSize of data for each dataset.\nLast Run Time\nDate and time when the pipeline ran to ingest data for each dataset.\nStatus Status of the pipeline. Value can be one of the following for a pipeline:      * Active - indicates that the pipeline is active  * Paused - indicates that data ingestion for the pipeline is paused Frequency\nFrequency at which cluster data is ingested and stored for querying.\nActions Actions you can take for each pipeline. You can click one of the following:  * || to pause data ingestion and to resume data ingestion. You can't pause on-demand ingestion of data.  * to edit the data ingestion schedule for the pipeline.  * to do the following:\n   \n   * Delete a pipeline. You can't undo this action. If you delete a pipeline, Atlas Data Lake deletes the datasets, including the data, and removes the datasets from the Federated Database Instances where they are referenced. If you delete a dataset inside a pipeline, Atlas Data Lake removes the dataset from the Federated Database Instance storage configuration where the dataset is referenced.\n   \n   * Trigger an on-demand pipeline run. \nVIEW ATLAS DATA LAKE PIPELINES FROM THE API \nTo retrieve all your Data Lake pipelines for a project through the API, send a GET request to the Data Lake pipelines endpoint. To learn more about the pipelines endpoint syntax and parameters for retrieving all of your Data Lake pipelines, see Return All Data Lake Pipelines from One Project. To retrieve one of your Data Lake pipelines through the API, send a GET request to the Data Lake pipelines endpoint with the name of the Data Lake pipeline that you want to retrieve.

Data Lake Pipeline You can pause and resume ingestion of snapshot data from the Atlas cluster to Atlas Data Lake datasets. You can't pause on-demand ingestion of snapshot data. \nPAUSE DATA INGESTION FOR YOUR DATA LAKE PIPELINE \nWhen you pause your Data Lake pipeline, Atlas doesn't ingest new datasets. You can continue to query previous snapshots from which data has been ingested. \nPAUSE DATA INGESTION FROM THE ATLAS UI \nTo pause a pipeline from the Atlas UI: 1 NAVIGATE TO ATLAS DATA LAKE IN THE ATLAS UI. \nTo navigate to the Atlas Data Lake page:       1. Log in to MongoDB Atlas.  2. Select Data Lake under Deployment on the left-hand navigation. 2 CLICK THE PAUSE BUTTON FOR THE PIPELINE THAT YOU WISH TO PAUSE. \n3 CLICK CONFIRM IN THE PAUSE INGESTION CONFIRMATION WINDOW. \nWhen you pause your Data Lake pipeline, the Last Updated column for the pipeline in the Atlas UI shows the status for the pipeline as Paused. \nPAUSE DATA INGESTION FROM THE API \nTo pause a pipeline through the API, send a POST request to the Data Lake pause endpoint with the name of the pipeline for which you want to pause the ingestion schedule. To learn more about the API syntax and parameters for the pause endpoint, see Pause One Data Lake Pipeline. \nRESUME DATA INGESTION FOR YOUR DATA LAKE PIPELINE \nWhen you resume data ingestion for a paused Atlas Data Lake pipeline, Atlas begins to take snapshots, which are then ingested in to your Data Lake datasets. \nRESUME DATA INGESTION FROM THE ATLAS UI \nTo resume data ingestion from the Atlas UI: 1 NAVIGATE TO ATLAS DATA LAKE IN THE ATLAS UI. \nTo navigate to the Atlas Data Lake page:  1.
