Frequently Asked Questions \nHOW TO FIX A \"MONGOSERVERSELECTIONERROR: CONNECT ECONNREFUSED ::1:27017\" ERROR? \nBeginning with version 17, Node.js defaults to using IPV6. You have a few options to resolve this error:      * Start your mongod in IPV6 mode with the --ipv6 flag, or setting the net.ipv6 option to true in your configuration file.\n   \n   Starting mongod with the --ipv6 flag\n   \n   mongod --ipv6\n   \n   \n   Setting the net.ipv6 option in the configuration file\n   \n   net:  ipv6: true\n   \n     * Explicitly use IPV4 by specifying family: 4 as an option to your MongoClient.\n   \n   const client = new MongoClient(uri, {  family: 4,});\n   \n    \nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN \"CONNECTTIMEOUTMS\", \"SOCKETTIMEOUTMS\" AND \"MAXTIMEMS\"? \nSetting\nDescription\nconnectTimeoutMS connectTimeoutMS is a connection option that sets the time, in milliseconds, for an individual connection from your connection pool to establish a TCP connection to the MongoDB server before timing out. \nTIP To modify the allowed time for MongoClient.connect to establish a connection to a MongoDB server, use the serverSelectionTimeoutMS option instead. Default: 30000 socketTimeoutMS\nsocketTimeoutMS specifies the amount of time the driver waits for an inactive socket before closing it. The default value is to never time out the socket. This option applies only to sockets that have already been connected.\nmaxTimeMS\nmaxTimeMS specifies the maximum amount of time the server should wait for an operation to complete after it has reached the server. If an operation runs over the specified time limit, it returns a timeout error. You can pass maxTimeMS only to an individual operation or to a cursor. To specify the optional settings for your MongoClient, declare one or more available settings in the options object of the constructor as follows: const client = new MongoClient(uri, {  connectTimeoutMS: <integer value>,  socketTimeoutMS: <integer value>});  To see all the available settings, see the MongoClientOptions API Documentation. To specify maxTimeMS, chain the maxTimeMS() method with a timeout specification to an operation that returns a Cursor: const cursor = myColl.find({}).maxTimeMS(50);  \nHOW CAN I PREVENT THE DRIVER FROM HANGING DURING CONNECTION OR FROM SPENDING TOO LONG TRYING TO REACH UNREACHABLE REPLICA SETS? \nTo prevent the driver from hanging during connection or to prevent the driver from spending too long trying to reach unreachable replica sets, you can set the connectTimeoutMS option of your connection options. Generally, you should ensure that the connectTimeoutMS setting is not lower than the longest network latency you have to a member of the set. If one of the secondary members is on the other side of the planet and has a latency of 10000 milliseconds, setting the connectTimeoutMS to anything lower will prevent the driver from ever connecting

\nNo, you should not use socketTimeoutMS to end operations that may run for too long and slow down the application. Attempting to do so may not achieve the intended result. Closing the socket causes a reconnect of the driver's connection pool, introducing latency to any other queued up operations. Chronically slow operations will, therefore, cause a large number of reconnect requests, negatively impacting throughput and performance. Also, closing the socket does not terminate the operation; it will continue to run on the MongoDB server, which could cause data inconsistencies if the application retries the operation on failure. However, there are important use cases for socketTimeoutMS - consider the following cases:  * A MongoDB process erroring out  * A misconfigured firewall causing a socket connection without sending a FIN packet In those cases, there is no way to detect that the connection has died. Setting the socketTimeoutMS is essential to ensure that the sockets are closed correctly. A good rule of thumb is to set socketTimeoutMS to two to three times the length of the slowest operation that runs through the driver. \nHOW CAN I PREVENT SOCKETS FROM TIMING OUT BEFORE THEY BECOME ACTIVE? \nHaving a large connection pool does not always reduce reconnection requests. Consider the following example: An application has a connection pool size of 5 sockets and has the socketTimeoutMS option set to 5000 milliseconds. Operations occur, on average, every 3000 milliseconds, and reconnection requests are frequent. Each socket times out after 5000 milliseconds, which means that all sockets must do something during those 5000 milliseconds to avoid closing. One message every 3000 milliseconds is not enough to keep the sockets active, so several of the sockets will time out after 5000 milliseconds. Reduce the poolSize in the connection settings to fix the problem. To specify the optional poolSize setting for your MongoClient, declare it in the options object of the constructor as follows: const client = new MongoClient(uri, {  poolSize: <integer value>,});  \nWHAT DOES A VALUE OF \"0\" MEAN FOR \"CONNECTTIMEOUTMS\" AND \"SOCKETTIMEOUTMS\"? \nIf you set the value of connectTimeoutMS or socketTimeoutMS to 0, your application will use the operating system's default socket timeout value. \nHOW CAN I PREVENT LONG-RUNNING OPERATIONS FROM SLOWING DOWN THE SERVER? \nYou can prevent long-running operations from slowing down the server by specifying a timeout value. You can chain the maxTimeMS() method to an operation that returns a Cursor to set a timeout on a specific action. The following example shows how you can chain the maxTimeMS() method to an operation that returns a Cursor: // Execute a find commandawait collection  .find({ $where: \"sleep(100) || true\" })  .maxTimeMS(50);  \nWHAT DOES THE \"KEEPALIVE\" SETTING DO? \nkeepAlive is a connection-setting that sets the number of milliseconds to wait before initiating a TLS keepAlive on a TCP Socket. The keepAlive option will keep a socket alive by sending periodic probes to MongoDB. However, this only works if the operating system supports SO_KEEPALIVE . \nWARNING \nIF A FIREWALL IGNORES OR DROPS THE KEEPALIVE PACKETS THIS MAY NOT WORK  \nWHAT CAN I DO IF I'M EXPERIENCING UNEXPECTED NETWORK BEHAVIOR? \nInternal firewalls that exist between application servers and MongoDB are often misconfigured and are overly aggressive in their removal of socket connections. If you experience unexpected network behavior, here are some things to check:  1. The firewall should send a FIN packet when closing a socket,allowing the driver to detect that the socket is closed.  2. The firewall should allow keepAlive probes. \nWHAT CAN I DO IF I'M GETTING \"ECONNRESET\" WHEN CALLING \"CLIENT.CONNECT()\"? \nIn most operating systems, each connection is associated with a file descriptor. There is typically a limit set by the operating system on the number of file descriptors used by a single process. An ECONNRESET error can occur if the connection pool size surpasses the limit of file descriptors. Consider the following operation: 1const uri = \"mongodb://localhost:27017/test?maxPoolSize=5000\";2// create a new MongoClient3const client = new MongoClient(uri);4\n5await client.connect(err => {6

The following list provides some strategies for callback users to adopt this version:\n   \n   * Migrate to the promise-based API (recommended)\n   \n   * Use the promise-based API and util.callbackify\n   \n   * Add mongodb-legacy to continue using callbacks\n   \n   For more information about these strategies, see Changes in the MongoDB Node.js Driver v5.  * This release removes support for the Collection.insert(), Collection.update(), and Collection.remove() helper methods. The following list provides instructions on how to replace the functionality of the removed methods:\n   \n   * Migrate from Collection.insert() to insertOne() or insertMany()\n   \n   * Migrate from Collection.update() to updateOne() or updateMany()\n   \n   * Migrate from Collection.remove() to deleteOne() or deleteMany() New features of the 5.0 Node.js driver release include:  * By default, the driver no longer checks types referenced in dot notation unless the StrictFilter type annotation is explicitly used. To learn more about this change, see the Typescript fundamentals page.\n   \n   \n   NOTE\n   \n   This change is for Typescript only, and does not affect queries or operations at runtime.  * Optional installation of @aws-sdk/credential-providers as a dependency.\n   \n   * The driver no longer includes AWS SDK modules by default. Use the following npm command to install the SDK:\n     \n     npm install --save \"@aws-sdk/credential-providers@^3.201.0\"\n     \n     \n     \n     If you install the SDK, npm notifies you if the version of the SDK you installed is incompatible with the driver. Once you install the dependency successfully, the driver uses the AWS SDK itself to manage credentials from the environment. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.14  IMPORTANT \nUPGRADE FROM V4.13 TO V4.14 This version includes a fix to a memory leak introduced in v4.13. We recommend upgrading to v4.14.

 * Deprecated methods and options that reference the legacy Logger. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.13 \nNew features of the 4.13 Node.js driver release include:  * Automatic cancellation of in-flight operations in the connection pool when the driver encounters network timeout errors.  * Disabled causal consistency in implicit sessions to prevent conflicting with the linearizable and available read concern settings.  * Fixed a potential memory leak by ensuring that the driver destroys MessageStream instances whenever their connections are destroyed. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.12  IMPORTANT \nUPGRADE DRIVER TO VERSION 4.12.1 The 4.12.1 Node.js driver includes a fix to a regression in monitoring logic that could cause processes to crash. New features of the 4.12 Node.js driver release include:  * Redefinition of the ChangeStream class as an async iterable. You can use ChangeStream instances in any context that expects an AsyncIterator.\n   \n   * Notably, change streams can now be used in Javascript for-await loops:\n     \n     const changeStream = myColl.watch();for await (const change of changeStream) {  console.log(\"Received change: \", change);}  * Fix to server monitoring when the driver skips monitoring events. In this release, the driver always updates its view of the topology when processing monitoring events.  * Performance improvements with buffering as a result of modification to data structures used internally in the driver. To learn more, see the v4.12.0 Release Highlights. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.11 \nWhen connecting to MongoDB Server version 6.0 or later, the driver prioritizes electionId settings before setVersion settings during Server Discovery and Monitoring events. In previous versions, the prioritization order was reversed. This release also includes added support for mutually recursive collection schema types. The driver also provides type safety for dot-notation queries up to a depth of eight in this release. At a depth greater than or equal to eight, Typescript successfully compiles your code but does not provide type safety. This depth limit on recursive types is a current limitation of TypeScript. \nMUTUALLY RECURSIVE SCHEMA TYPE CHECKING EXAMPLE \nSuppose we have a collection of type Collection<Author> that contains the following mutually recursive types: interface Author {    name: string;    bestBook: Book;}\ninterface Book {    title: string;    author: Author; } TypeScript enforces type checking up to a depth of eight. The following code causes a TypeScript compilation error because the name property value must be a string type: myColl.findOne({ 'bestBook.author.bestBook.title': 25 }); At a depth greater than or equal to eight, TypeScript compiles your code but no longer type checks it. For example, the following code assigns a number to a string property but does not cause a compilation error because the referenced property is at a depth of 10: myColl.findOne({    'bestBook.author.bestBook.author.bestBook.author.bestBook.author.bestBook.author.name': 25}); To learn more, see the v4.11.0 Release Highlights. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.10 \nNew features of the 4.10 Node.js driver release include:  * Callback Deprecation\n   \n   * Callbacks are now deprecated in favor of Promises. Callbacks will be removed in the next major release. The Node driver team recommends migrating to promises where possible:\n     \n     * Use async/await syntax.\n     \n     * Use the Node.js callbackify utility:\n       \n       require('util').callbackify(() => myColl.findOne())(callback)\n       \n       \n     \n     * Use then syntax:\n       \n       myColl.findOne().then(res => callback(null, res), err => callback(err))\n       \n       \n   \n   * If you are unable to migrate to Promises in a large codebase, you can use the MongoDB Node.js driver with optional callback support package.

 * Included the latest BSON release, which adds automatic UUID support. See the BSON release notes here. To learn more, see v4.9.0 Release Highlights. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.8 \nNew features of the 4.8 Node.js driver release include:  * Added auto-completion and type safety for nested keys in an update filter  * client.startSession() can now be called before connecting to MongoDB  * estimatedDocumentCount() method can now accept a comment To learn more, see v4.8.0 Release Highlights. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.7 \nNew features of the 4.7 Node.js driver release include:  * The MongoClient.connect() method is now optional when connecting to your MongoDB instance  * Ability to compress messages with the Zstandard compression algorithm  * Added support for the maxConnecting connection option  * Ability for change stream documents to show your documents before and after an update  * Added support for new change stream fields related to Cluster to Cluster Replication  * The estimatedDocumentCount() method now uses the $count database command  * Improved connecting to MongoDB in the AWS Lambda Init phase \nIMPORTANT \nDEPRECATION NOTICE The ResumeOptions interface is deprecated. Use the ChangeStreamCursorOptions interface instead. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.6 \nNew features of the 4.6 Node.js driver release include:  * Improved the ChangeStreamDocument in TypeScript.  * Even distribution of server selection based on load across servers. To learn more, see v4.6.0 Release Highlights. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.5 \nSee v4.5.0 Release Highlights on GitHub. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.4 \nNew features of the 4.4 Node.js driver release include:  * KMIP provider support when using CSFLE.  * TLS support when using CSFLE.  * Hostname canonicalization now accepts \"none\", \"forward\", and \"forwardAndReverse\" as authMechanismProperties when using GSSAPI.  * In the 4.0.0 release of the driver, the deprecated collection.count() method was inadvertently changed to behave like collection.countDocuments(). In this release, the collection.count() method is updated to match legacy behavior:\n   \n   * If a query is provided, collection.count() behaves the same as collection.countDocuments() and performs a collection scan.\n   \n   * If no query is provided, collection.count() behaves the same as collection.estimatedDocumentCount() and relies on collection metadata.\n   \n   \n   IMPORTANT\n   \n   \n   DEPRECATION NOTICE\n   \n   The cursor.count() method is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version, along with collection.count(). Use the collection.estimatedDocumentCount() or collection.countDocuments() methods instead. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.3 \nNew features of the 4.3 Node.js driver release include:  * SOCKS5 support  * Option to disable UTF-8 validation  * Type inference for nested documents \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.2 \nNew features of the 4.2 Node.js driver release include:  * srvMaxHosts and srvServiceName DNS seedlist connection options \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.1 \nNew features of the 4.1 Node.js driver release include:  * Added load balanced connection support for all cluster types including the beta Serverless platform.  * Added support for the advanceClusterTime() method to determine if the ClientSession should update its cluster time. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 4.0  IMPORTANT In this release of the driver, the deprecated collection.count() method was inadvertently changed to behave like collection.countDocuments(). This behavior is corrected in version 4.4. New features of the 4.0 Node.js driver release include: \nTYPESCRIPT \n * We've migrated the driver to TypeScript. You can now harness the type hinting and intellisense features in editors that support it to develop your MongoDB applications. Enjoy the benefits of this work in pure JavaScript projects as well.  * The underlying BSON library used by this version is now migrated to TypeScript.  * Inline documentation is now consistently formatted to improve display in editors.  * If you are a user of the community types @types/mongodb, there will likely be issues adopting the types from our codebase. We could not achieve a one to one match in types due to the details of writing the codebase in TypeScript. We'd love to hear your TypeScript related feature requests.

\nThe minimum supported version of Node.js is now v12.9 or greater for version 4 of the driver. Support for our 3.x branches will continue until summer 2022 to allow time to upgrade. \nNOTE 3.x supports back to Node.js v4. CURSOR IMPROVEMENTS \nOur Cursor implementation is now updated to make it clear what is possible before and after execution of an operation. \nEXAMPLE const fc = myColl.find({a: 2.3}).skip(1)for await (const doc of fc) {  console.log(doc)  fc.limit(1) // incorrect usage, cursor already executing} There was inconsistency surrounding how the cursor would error if a setting was applied after cursor execution began. Now, the cursor will throw an error when attempting to apply operations in an invalid state, similar to the following: MongoError: Cursor is already initialized  * Affected classes:\n   \n   * AbstractCursor\n   \n   * FindCursor\n   \n   * AggregationCursor\n   \n   * ChangeStreamCursor (This is the underlying cursor for ChangeStream)\n   \n   * ListCollectionsCursor CURSOR STREAM API \nOur Cursor types no longer extend Readable directly. They must be transformed into a stream by calling cursor.stream(). \nEXAMPLE const cursor = myColl.find({});const stream = cursor.stream();stream.on(\"data\", data => console.log);stream.on(\"error\", () => client.close()); Use hasNext() and next() for manual iteration. Use for await of syntax or any Promise helpers for asynchronous iteration. MONGOCLIENTOPTIONS INTERFACE \nWith type hinting, you should find that options passed to a MongoClient are enumerated and discoverable. We've made a large effort to process all options in the driver to give early warnings about incompatible settings to get your app up and running in a correct state quickly.  * checkServerIdentity is no longer checked before being passed to the underlying Node API. Previously, accepted values were false, or a function. Now, the argument must be a function. Specifying a boolean will result in an error being thrown.  * It is no longer required to specify useUnifiedTopology or useNewUrlParser. CREATECOLLECTION() \nThis method no longer supports a strict option, which returned an error if the collection did not exist. To assert the existence of a collection, use the listCollections() method instead. \nEXAMPLE const collections = (await db.listCollections({}, { nameOnly: true })  .toArray()).map(    ({name}) => name  );if (!collections.includes(myNewCollectionName)) {  throw new Error(`${myNewCollectionName} doesn't exist`);}  BULKWRITEERROR → MONGOBULKWRITEERROR \nBulkWriteError is now renamed to MongoBulkWriteError. When running bulk operations that make writes you can encounter errors depending on your settings. Import the new class name MongoBulkWriteError when testing for errors in bulk operations. DB \nDB is no longer an EventEmitter. Listen for events directly from your MongoClient instance. COLLECTION.GROUP() \nThe Collection.group() helper, deprecated since MongoDB 3.4, is now removed. Use the aggregation pipeline $group operator instead. AUTHENTICATION \n * gssapiServiceName is now removed. Use authMechanismProperties.SERVICE_NAME in the URI or as an option on MongoClientOptions.\n   \n   \n   EXAMPLE\n   \n   ?authMechanismProperties.SERVICE_NAME// ornew MongoClient(url, { SERVICE_NAME: \"alternateServiceName\" })\n   \n     * Specifying username and password as options is only supported in the URI or as an option on MongoClientOptions.\n   \n   \n   EXAMPLE\n   \n   new MongoClient(\"mongodb://username:password@<host><port>\")// ornew MongoClient(url, { auth: { username: \"<>\", password: \"<>\" } })\n   \n    GRIDSTORE REMOVAL \nThe GridStore API (already deprecated in 3.x) is now replaced with GridFSBucket. For more information on GridFS, see the mongodb manual. Below are some snippets that represent equivalent operations.

 FILE SEEKING \nGridFSBucket uses the Node.js Stream API. You can replicate file seeking by using the start and end options, creating a download stream from your GridFSBucket. \nEXAMPLE bucket.openDownloadStreamByName(filename, { start: 0, end: 100 })  FILE UPLOAD & DOWNLOAD  EXAMPLE await client.connect();const filename = 'test.txt'; // whatever local file name you wantconst db = client.db();const bucket = new GridFSBucket(db);\nfs.createReadStream(filename)  .pipe(bucket.openUploadStream(filename))  .on('error', console.error)  .on('finish', () => {    console.log('done writing to db!');\n    bucket      .find()      .toArray()      .then(files => {        console.log(files);\n        bucket          .openDownloadStreamByName(filename)          .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('downloaded_' + filename))          .on('error', console.error)          .on('finish', () => {            console.log('done downloading!');            client.close();          });      });  });  \nNOTE GridFSBucket does not need to be closed like GridStore. FILE DELETION  EXAMPLE // old wayGridStore.unlink(db, name, callback);// new waybucket.delete(file_id);  FINDING FILE METADATA \nFile metadata that used to be accessible on the GridStore instance can be found by querying the bucket. \nEXAMPLE const fileMetaDataList: GridFSFile[] = bucket.find({}).toArray();  UNIFIED TOPOLOGY \n * We internally now only manage a unifiedTopology when you connect to a mongod. The differences between this and previous versions is detailed here.  * It is no longer required to specify useUnifiedTopology or useNewUrlParser.  * You must use the new directConnection option to connect to uninitialized replica set members.

Docs Home → Node.js \nWATCH FOR CHANGES  OPEN A CHANGE STREAM \nYou can watch for changes in MongoDB using the watch() method on the following objects:      * Collection  * Database  * MongoClient For each object, the watch() method opens a change stream to emit change event documents when they occur. The watch() method optionally takes an aggregation pipeline which consists of an array of aggregation stages as the first parameter. The aggregation stages filter and transform the change events. In the following snippet, the $match stage matches all change event documents with a runtime value of less than 15, filtering all others out. const pipeline = [ { $match: { runtime: { $lt: 15 } } } ];const changeStream = myColl.watch(pipeline);  The watch() method accepts an options object as the second parameter. Refer to the links at the end of this section for more information on the settings you can configure with this object. The watch() method returns an instance of a ChangeStream. You can read events from change streams by iterating over them or listening for events. Select the tab that corresponds to the way you want to read events from the change stream:   WARNING Using a ChangeStream in EventEmitter and Iterator mode concurrently is not supported by the driver and causes an error. This is to prevent undefined behavior, where the driver cannot guarantee which consumer receives documents first. \nEXAMPLES  ITERATION \nThe following example opens a change stream on the haikus collection in the insertDB database and prints change events as they occur: \nNOTE You can use this example to connect to an instance of MongoDB and interact with a database that contains sample data. To learn more about connecting to your MongoDB instance and loading a sample dataset, see the Usage Examples guide.   NOTE \nIDENTICAL CODE SNIPPETS The JavaScript and TypeScript code snippets above are identical. There are no TypeScript specific features of the driver relevant to this use case. When you run this code and then make a change to the haikus collection, such as performing an insert or delete operation, you can see the change event document printed in your terminal. For example, if you insert a document to the collection, the code prints the following output: Received change:{  _id: {    _data: '...'  },  operationType: 'insert',  clusterTime: new Timestamp({ t: 1675800603, i: 31 }),  fullDocument: {    _id: new ObjectId(\"...\"),    ...  },  ns: { db: 'insertDB', coll: 'haikus' },  documentKey: { _id: new ObjectId(\"...\") }} \nNOTE \nRECEIVE FULL DOCUMENTS FROM UPDATES Change events that contain information on update operations only return the modified fields by default rather than the full updated document. You can configure your change stream to also return the most current version of the document by setting the fullDocument field of the options object to \"updateLookup\" as follows: const options = { fullDocument: \"updateLookup\" };// This could be any pipeline.const pipeline = [];\nconst changeStream = myColl.watch(pipeline, options);  \nLISTENER FUNCTION \nThe following example opens a change stream on the haikus collection in the insertDB database. Let's create a listener function to receive and print change events that occur on the collection. First, open the change stream on the collection and then define a listener on the change stream using the on() method. Once you set the listener, generate a change event by performing a change to the collection. To generate the change event on the collection, let's use the insertOne() method to add a new document. Since insertOne() may run before the listener function can register, we use a timer, defined as simulateAsyncPause to wait 1 second before executing the insert. We also use simulateAsyncPause after the insertion of the document. This provides ample time for the listener function to receive the change event and for the listener to complete its execution before closing the ChangeStream instance using the close() method. \nNOTE \nREASON TO INCLUDE TIMERS The timers used in this example are only for demonstration purposes. They make sure that there is enough time to register the listener and have the listener process the change event before exiting.   NOTE \nIDENTICAL CODE SNIPPETS The JavaScript and TypeScript code snippets above are identical. There are no TypeScript specific features of the driver relevant to this use case.

Multikey Indexes (Indexes on Array Fields)\n * Clustered Indexes\n * Text Indexes\n * Geospatial Indexes\n * Unique Indexes \nOVERVIEW \nIndexes are data structures that support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. They contain copies of parts of the data in documents to make queries more efficient. Without indexes, MongoDB must scan every document in a collection to find the documents that match each query. These collection scans are slow and can negatively affect the performance of your application. By using an index to limit the number of documents MongoDB scans, queries can be more efficient and therefore return faster. \nQUERY COVERAGE AND PERFORMANCE \nWhen you execute a query against MongoDB, your query can include three parts:      * query criteria that specify field(s) and value(s) you are looking for  * options that affect the query's execution (e.g. read concern)  * projection criteria to specify the fields MongoDB should return (optional) When all the fields specified in the query criteria and projection of a query are indexed, MongoDB returns results directly from the index without scanning any documents in the collection or loading them into memory. For additional information on how to ensure your index covers your query criteria and projection, see the MongoDB manual articles on query coverage and index intersection. \nOPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS \nTo improve query performance, build indexes on fields that appear often in your application's queries and operations that return sorted results. Each index that you add consumes disk space and memory when active so you should track index memory and disk usage for capacity planning. In addition, when a write operation updates an indexed field, MongoDB also has to update the related index. For more information on designing your data model and choosing indexes appropriate for your application, see the MongoDB server documentation on Indexing Strategies and Data Modeling and Indexes. \nINDEX TYPES \nMongoDB supports a number of different index types to support querying your data. The following sections describe the most common index types and provide sample code for creating each index type. \nSINGLE FIELD INDEXES \nSingle field indexes are indexes that improve performance for queries that specify ascending or descending sort order on a single field of a document. The following example uses the createIndex() method to create an ascending order index on the title field in the movies collection in the sample_mflix database. const database = client.db(\"sample_mflix\");const movies = database.collection(\"movies\");\n// Create an ascending index on the \"title\" field in the// \"movies\" collection.const result = await movies.createIndex({ title: 1 });console.log(`Index created: ${result}`);  The following is an example of a query that would be covered by the index created above. const query = { title: \"Batman\" }const sort = { title: 1 };const projection = { _id: 0, title: 1 };\nconst cursor = movies  .find(query)  .sort(sort)  .project(projection);  To learn more, see Single Field Indexes. \nCOMPOUND INDEXES \nCompound indexes are indexes that improve performance for queries that specify ascending or descending sort order for multiple fields of a document. You must specify the direction (ascending or descending) for each field in the index. The following example uses the createIndex() method to create a compound index on the type and genre fields in the movies collection in the sample_mflix database. const database = client.db(\"sample_mflix\");const movies = database.collection(\"movies\");\n// Create an ascending index on the \"type\" and \"genre\" fields// in the \"movies\" collection.const result = await movies.createIndex({ type: 1, genre: 1 });console.log(`Index created: ${result}`);  The following is an example of a query that would be covered by the index created above. const query = { type: \"movie\", genre: \"Drama\" };const sort = { type: 1, genre: 1 };const projection = { _id: 0, type: 1, genre: 1 };\nconst cursor = movies  .find(query)  .sort(sort)  .project(projection);  To learn

You can create a multikey index on a field with an array value by calling the createIndex() method. The following code creates an ascending index on the cast field in the movies collection of the sample_mflix database: const database = client.db(\"sample_mflix\");const movies = database.collection(\"movies\");\n// Create a multikey index on the \"cast\" fieldconst result = await movies.createIndex({ cast: 1 });  The following code queries the multikey index to find documents with a cast field value that contains \"Viola Davis\": const query = { cast: \"Viola Davis\" };const projection = { _id: 0, cast: 1 , title: 1 };\nconst cursor = movies  .find(query)  .project(projection);  Multikey indexes behave differently from non-multikey indexes in terms of query coverage, index bound computation, and sort behavior. For a full explanation of multikey indexes, including a discussion of their behavior and limitations, refer to the Multikey Indexes page in the MongoDB Server manual. \nCLUSTERED INDEXES \nClustered indexes are indexes that improve the performance of insert, update, and delete operations on clustered collections. Clustered collections store documents ordered by the clustered index key value. To create a clustered index, specify the clusteredIndex option in the CollectionOption. The clusteredIndex option must specify the _id field as the key and the unique field as true. The following example uses the createCollection() method to create a clustered index on the _id field in the vendors collection of the tea database. const db = client.db('tea');await db.createCollection('ratings', {  clusteredIndex: {    key: { _id: 1 },    unique: true  }});  To learn more, see Clustered Indexes and Clustered Collections. \nTEXT INDEXES \nText indexes support text search queries on string content. These indexes can include any field whose value is a string or an array of string elements. MongoDB supports text search for various languages. You can specify the default language as an option when creating the index. Read our guide on text search queries for more information. The following example uses the createIndex() method to create a text index on the fullplot field in the movies collection in the sample_mflix database and specifies english as the default language. const database = client.db(\"sample_mflix\");const movies = database.collection(\"movies\");\n// Create a text index on the \"fullplot\" field in the// \"movies\" collection.const result = await movies.createIndex({ fullplot: \"text\" }, { default_language: \"english\" });console.log(`Index created: ${result}`);  The following is an example of a query that would be covered by the index created above. Note that the sort is omitted because text indexes do not contain sort order. const query = { $text: { $search: \"java coffee shop\" } };const projection = { _id: 0, fullplot: 1 };const cursor = movies  .find(query)  .project(projection);  To learn more, see Text Indexes. \nGEOSPATIAL INDEXES \nMongoDB supports queries of geospatial coordinate data using 2dsphere indexes. With a 2dsphere index, you can query the geospatial data for inclusion, intersection, and proximity. For more information on querying geospatial data with the MongoDB Node.js driver, read our Search Geospatial guide. To create a 2dsphere index, you must specify a field that contains only GeoJSON objects. For more details on this type, see the MongoDB server manual page on GeoJSON objects.

Delete Files\n * Delete a GridFS Bucket\n * Additional Resources \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to store and retrieve large files in MongoDB using GridFS. GridFS is a specification that describes how to split files into chunks during storage and reassemble them during retrieval. The driver implementation of GridFS manages the operations and organization of the file storage. You should use GridFS if the size of your file exceeds the BSON-document size limit of 16 megabytes. For more detailed information on whether GridFS is suitable for your use case, see the GridFS server manual page. Navigate the following sections to learn more about GridFS operations and implementation:      * Create a GridFS Bucket  * Upload Files  * Retrieve File Information  * Download Files  * Rename Files  * Delete Files  * Delete a GridFS Bucket \nHOW GRIDFS WORKS \nGridFS organizes files in a bucket, a group of MongoDB collections that contain the chunks of files and descriptive information. Buckets contain the following collections, named using the convention defined in the GridFS specification:  * The chunks collection stores the binary file chunks.  * The files collection stores the file metadata. When you create a new GridFS bucket, the driver creates the chunks and files collections, prefixed with the default bucket name fs, unless you specify a different name. The driver also creates an index on each collection to ensure efficient retrieval of files and related metadata. The driver only creates the GridFS bucket on the first write operation if it does not already exist. The driver only creates indexes if they do not exist and when the bucket is empty. For more information on GridFS indexes, see the server manual page on GridFS Indexes. When storing files with GridFS, the driver splits the files into smaller pieces, each represented by a separate document in the chunks collection. It also creates a document in the files collection that contains a unique file id, file name, and other file metadata. You can upload the file from memory or from a stream. The following diagram describes how GridFS splits files when uploading to a bucket:  When retrieving files, GridFS fetches the metadata from the files collection in the specified bucket and uses the information to reconstruct the file from documents in the chunks collection. You can read the file into memory or output it to a stream. \nCREATE A GRIDFS BUCKET \nCreate a bucket or get a reference to an existing one to begin storing or retrieving files from GridFS. Create a GridFSBucket instance, passing a database as the parameter. You can then use the GridFSBucket instance to call read and write operations on the files in your bucket: const db = client.db(dbName);const bucket = new mongodb.GridFSBucket(db);  Pass your bucket name as the second parameter to the create() method to create or reference a bucket with a custom name other than the default name fs, as shown in the following example: const bucket = new mongodb.GridFSBucket(db, { bucketName: 'myCustomBucket' });  For more information, see the GridFSBucket API documentation. \nUPLOAD FILES \nUse the openUploadStream() method from GridFSBucket to create an upload stream for a given file name. You can use the pipe() method to connect a Node.js fs read stream to the upload stream. The openUploadStream() method allows you to specify configuration information such as file chunk size and other field/value pairs to store as metadata. Set these options as parameters of openUploadStream() as shown in the following code snippet: fs.createReadStream('./myFile').     pipe(bucket.openUploadStream('myFile', {         chunkSizeBytes: 1048576,         metadata: { field: 'myField', value: 'myValue' }     });  See the openUploadStream() API documentation for more information. \nRETRIEVE FILE INFORMATION \nIn this section, you can learn how to retrieve file metadata stored in the files collection of the GridFS bucket. The metadata contains information about the file it refers to, including:  * The _id of the file  * The name of the file  * The length/size of the file  * The upload date and time  * A metadata

Docs Home → Node.js \nPROMISES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Promises\n * Await\n * Operational Considerations \nOVERVIEW \nThe Node.js driver uses the asynchronous Javascript API to communicate with your MongoDB cluster. Asynchronous Javascript allows you to execute operations without waiting for the processing thread to become free. This helps prevent your application from becoming unresponsive when executing long-running operations. For more information about asynchronous Javascript, see the MDN web documentation on Asynchronous Javascript. This section describes Promises that you can use with the Node.js driver to access the results of your method calls to your MongoDB cluster. \nPROMISES \nA Promise is an object returned by the asynchronous method call that allows you to access information on the eventual success or failure of the operation that they wrap. The Promise is in the Pending state if the operation is still running, Fulfilled if the operation completed successfully, and Rejected if the operation threw an exception. For more information on Promises and related terminology, see the MDN documentation on Promises. Most driver methods that communicate with your MongoDB cluster, such as findOneAndUpdate() and countDocuments(), return Promise objects and already contain logic to handle the success or failure of the operation. You can define your own logic that executes once the Promise reaches the Fulfilled or Rejected state by appending the then() method. The first parameter of then() is the method that gets called when the Promise reaches the Fulfilled state and the optional second parameter is the method that gets called when it reaches the Rejected state. The then() method returns a Promise to which you can append additional then() methods. When you append one or more then() methods to a Promise, each call passes its execution result to the next one. This pattern is called Promise chaining. The following code snippet shows an example of Promise chaining by appending a single then() method. collection  .updateOne({ name: \"Mount McKinley\" }, { $set: { meters: 6190 } })  .then(    res => console.log(`Updated ${res.result.n} documents`),    err => console.error(`Something went wrong: ${err}`),  );  If you only need to handle Promise transitions to the Rejected state, rather than passing a null first parameter to then(), you can instead use the catch() method which accepts a single callback, executed when the Promise transitions to the Rejected state. The catch() method is often appended at the end of a Promise chain to handle any exceptions thrown. The following code snippet demonstrates appending a catch() method to the end of a Promise chain. deleteOne({ name: \"Mount Doom\" })  .then(result => {    if (result.deletedCount !== 1) {      throw \"Could not find Mount Doom!\";    }    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {      ...    });  })  .then(result => console.log(`Vanquished ${result.quantity} Nazgul`))  .catch(err => console.error(`Fatal error occurred: ${err}`));  \nNOTE Certain methods in the driver such as find() return a Cursor instead of a Promise. To determine what type each method returns, refer to the Node.js API documentation. \nAWAIT \nIf you are using async functions, you can use the await operator on a Promise to pause further execution until the Promise reaches either the Fulfilled or Rejected state and returns. Since the await operator waits for the resolution of the Promise, you can use it in place of Promise chaining to sequentially execute your logic. The following code snippet uses await to execute the same logic as the first Promise chaining example. async function run() {  ...  try {    res = await myColl.updateOne(      { name: \"Mount McKinley\" },      { $set: { meters: 6190 } },    );    console.log(`Updated ${res.result.n} documents`);  } catch (err) {    console.error(`Something went wrong: ${err}`);  }}  For additional

with the _id Field\n * Insert Operations and the _id Field\n * Find Methods and the _id Field\n * Known Limitations\n * Recursive Types and Dot Notation\n * Mutual Recursion \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn about the TypeScript features and limitations of the MongoDB Node.js driver. TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that compiles to JavaScript. All TypeScript features of the driver are optional. All valid JavaScript code written with the driver is also valid TypeScript code. For more information, see the TypeScript website. \nFEATURES \nIf you use TypeScript, you can specify a type for some classes in the driver. All classes that accept a type parameter in the driver have the default type Document. The Document interface has the following definition: interface Document {  [key: string]: any;}  All object types extend the Document interface. For more information on object types, see the TypeScript handbook. \nTYPE PARAMETERS THAT EXTEND DOCUMENT \nThe following classes accept all types that extend the Document interface:      * Collection  * ChangeStream You can pass a type parameter that extends the Document interface like this: 1interface Pet {2  name: string;3  age: number;4}5\n6const database = client.db(\"<your database>\");7const collection = database.collection<Pet>(\"<your collection>\");  \nIMPORTANT \nKEYS NOT IN TYPE PARAMETER RECEIVE ANY TYPE Keys not listed in your specified type parameter receive the any type. The following code snippet demonstrates this behavior: 1interface User {2  email: string;3}4\n5const database = client.db(\"<your database>\");6const myColl = db.collection<User>(\"<your collection>\");7myColl.find({ age: \"Accepts any type!\" });  \nTYPE PARAMETERS OF ANY TYPE \nThe following classes accept all type parameters:  * FindCursor  * AggregationCursor You can find a code snippet that shows how to specify a type for the FindCursor class in the Find Multiple Documents Usage Example. \nTYPE SAFETY AND DOT NOTATION \nStarting in version 5.0, by default, the Node.js driver does not provide type safety for operations that search on fields expressed in dot notation. Dot notation is a syntax you can use to navigate nested JSON objects. When you construct a filter to pass to a query, the driver will not raise a type error even if you specify an incorrectly typed value for a field expressed in dot notation. The following code snippet defines the ClassificationPet interface, which includes a classification field that enables you to specify the genus and color of dogs and cats: interface ClassificationPet {  name: string;  age: number;  classification: { genus: \"Canis\" | \"Felis\"; color: string };}  The driver does not raise a type error for the following code sample, even though the value of classification.color is a boolean instead of a string: await myColl.findOneAndDelete({ \"classification.color\": false });  You can enable type-checking by constructing filters as StrictFilter or StrictUpdateFilter types. \nWARNING The StrictFilter and StrictUpdateFilter types are experimental and may show type errors in valid queries where there should be none. In the following code sample, the filter is assigned a StrictFilter type. Given this filter type, the Node.js driver reports a type error because the value of classification.color is a boolean instead of a string. const filterPredicate: StrictFilter<ClassificationPet> = { \"classification.color\": false };await myColl.findOneAndDelete(filterPredicate);  The following example assigns a StrictUpdateFilter type to an update filter. The Node.js driver reports a type error because the value of classification.color is a boolean instead of a string. const updateFilter: StrictUpdateFilter<ClassificationPet> = { $set: { \"classification.color\": false } }await pets.updateOne({}, updateFilter);  REFERENCING KEYS THAT INCORPORATE VARIABLES \nIf you need to query a collection or perform another operation with a key that incorporates variables, you must use an as const assertion when specifying the key.

interface ClassificationPet {  name: string;  mealtimes: Mealtime[];}\ninterface Mealtime{  time: string;  amount: number;}  The following code snippet performs a find-and-update operation on a collection of ClassificationPet documents. The operation updates the nested time field of the Mealtime instance at index 1. The index position is specified by the variable mealCounter: const mealCounter = 1;\nawait myColl.findOneAndUpdate(  { name: \"Lassie\" },  { $set: { [`mealtimes.${mealCounter}.time` as const]: '4:00 PM' } },);  To learn more about dot notation, see Dot Notation in the MongoDB manual. To learn more about the limitations of dot notation in the Node.js driver, see the Recursive Types and Dot Notation section. \nWORKING WITH THE _ID FIELD \nMongoDB does not recommend specifying the _id as a part of your model. Omitting the _id field makes the model more generic and reusable and more accurately models the data important to an application. The Node driver’s TypeScript integration takes care of adding the _id field to the return types for relevant methods. If you need to work with the _id field in your models, see the below sections for information on write and read operations. \nINSERT OPERATIONS AND THE _ID FIELD \nHow you specify the _id field in type parameters passed to your Collection instance affects the behavior of insert operations. The following table describes how different _id field specifications affect insert operations: _id field type\nExample Type\nRequired on insert\nBehavior on insert\nUnspecified\nNot applicable\nNo\nThe driver creates an ObjectId value for each inserted document.\nSpecified\n{ _id: number };\nYes\nIf you do not specify a value for the _id field in an insert operation, the driver raises an error.\nSpecified as optional\n{ _id?: number };\nNo\nIf you do not specify the _id field in an insert operation, the driver adds an _id field value generated by the primary key factory. If you must specify the _id field as required in the type you define to represent documents in your collection but you do not want to specify values for the _id field in insert operations, use the OptionalId helper type when you create your collection. The OptionalId type accepts a type parameter as an argument and returns that type with an optional _id field. The following code snippet defines the IdPet interface, which includes a type for the _id field: interface IdPet {  _id: ObjectId;  name: string;  age: number;}  The following code uses the preceding interface along with the OptionalId type to insert a document without specifying a value for the _id field: const database = client.db(\"<your database>\");const collection = db.collection<OptionalId<IdPet>>(\"<your collection>\");\nmyColl.insertOne({  name: \"Spot\",  age: 2});  To learn more about the _id field, see The _id Field in the MongoDB manual. To learn more about the types, interfaces, and classes discussed in this section, see the following resources:  * OptionalId API documentation  * PkFactory API documentation  * ObjectId source code \nFIND METHODS AND THE _ID FIELD \nThe find and findOne methods of the Collection class include the _id field in their return type. If the type parameter you passed to your Collection instance includes the _id field, the type of the _id field in the values returned from the find methods is the same as the type of the _id field in your type parameter. If the type parameter you passed to your Collection instance does not include the _id field, the driver gives the _id field in the values returned from the find methods the type ObjectId. The following code uses the Pet interface to return a document with an _id of type ObjectId: const database = client.db(\"<your database>\");const collection = db.collection<Pet>(\"<your collection>\");\nconst document = await myColl.findOne({  name: \"Spot\",});const id : ObjectId = document._id;  The following code uses the IdNumberPet interface to return a document with an _id field of type number: interface IdNumberPet {  _id: number;  name: string;  age: number;}\nconst database = client.db(\"<your database>\");const collection = db.collection<IdNumberPet>(\"<your

To show this behavior, the following code snippet passes type checking but raises an error at runtime: const doc = await myColl.findOne(  {},  { projection: { _id: 0, name: 1 }

To learn more about the classes and methods discussed in this section, see the following API documentation:  * Collection  * find  * findOne \nKNOWN LIMITATIONS \nLearn about the following TypeScript specific limitations of the Node.js driver:  * No type safety for dot notation references to nested instances of recursive types  * Depth limitations on type safety for mutually recursive types \nRECURSIVE TYPES AND DOT NOTATION \nThe Node.js driver cannot provide type safety within nested instances of recursive types referenced through dot notation. A recursive type is a type that references itself. You can update the Pet interface to be recursive by allowing a pet to have its own pet. The following is the recursive Pet interface: interface RecursivePet {   pet?: RecursivePet;   name: string;   age: number;}  \nNOTE \nDEPTH LIMIT The Node.js driver does not traverse nested recursive types when type checking dot notation keys to avoid hitting TypeScript's recursive depth limit. The following code snippet references a nested instance of the RecursivePet interface with an incorrect type using dot notation, but the TypeScript compiler does not raise a type error: database   .collection<RecursivePet>(\"<your collection>\")   .findOne({ \"pet.age\": \"Spot\" });  The following code snippet references a top-level instance of the RecursivePet interface with an incorrect type and raises a type error: database   .collection<RecursivePet>(\"<your collection>\")   .findOne({ pet: \"Spot\" });  The error raised by the preceding code snippet is as follows: index.ts(19,59): error TS2769: No overload matches this call.The last overload gave the following error.Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'Condition<Pet>'.  If you must have type safety within nested instances of recursive types, you must write your query or update without dot notation. To learn more about dot notation, see Dot Notation in the MongoDB manual. \nMUTUAL RECURSION \nA mutually recursive type exists when two types contain a property that is of the other's type. You can update the Pet interface to be mutually recursive by allowing a pet to have a handler, and defining a handler to have a pet. The following examples reference the mutually recursive Pet and Handler interfaces: interface Pet {   handler?: Handler;   name: string;   age: number;}\ninterface Handler {   pet: Pet;   name: string;}  The Node.js driver provides type safety for mutually recursive types referenced through dot notation up to a depth of eight. The following code snippet assigns a string to a number and raises a type error because the referenced property is at a depth of four: database   .collection<Pet>(\"<your collection>\")   .findOne({'handler.pet.handler.pet.age': \"four\"});  The error raised by the preceding code snippet is as follows: index.ts(19,59): error TS2769: No overload matches this call.The last overload gave the following error.Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'Condition<number> | undefined'.  At a depth greater than or equal to eight, TypeScript compiles your code but no longer type checks it. The following code assigns a string to a number property but does not cause a compilation error because the referenced property is at a depth of 10: database   .collection<Pet>(\"<your collection>\")

Index\n * Collation Query Examples Collations are available in MongoDB 3.4 and later. \nOVERVIEW \nThis guide shows you how to use collations, a set of sorting rules, to run operations using string ordering for specific languages and locales (a community or region that shares common language idioms). MongoDB sorts strings using binary collation by default. This collation method uses the ASCII standard character values to compare and order strings. Languages and locales have specific character ordering conventions that differ from the ASCII standard. For example, in Canadian French, the right-most accented character determines the ordering for strings when the other characters are the same. Consider the following French words: cote, coté, côte, and côté. MongoDB sorts them in the following order using the default binary collation: cotecotécôtecôté  MongoDB sorts them in the following order using the Canadian French collation: cotecôtecotécôté  \nUSAGE \nYou can specify a collation when you create a new collection or new index. You can also specify a collation for CRUD operations and aggregations. When you create a new collection with a collation, you define the default collation for any of the operations that support collation called on that collection. You can override the collation for an operation by specifying a different one. \nNOTE Currently, you cannot create a collation on an existing collection. To use collations with an existing collection, create an index with the collation and specify the same collation in your operations on it. When you create an index with a collation, you specify the sort order for operations that use that index. To use the collation in the index, you must provide a matching collation in the operation, and the operation must use the index. While most index types support collation, the following types support only binary comparison:      * text  * 2d  * geoHaystack \nCOLLATION PARAMETERS \nThe collation object contains the following parameters: collation: {  locale: <string>,  caseLevel: <bool>,  caseFirst: <string>,  strength: <int>,  numericOrdering: <bool>,  alternate: <string>,  maxVariable: <string>,  backwards: <bool>}  You must specify the locale field in the collation; all other fields are optional. For a complete list of supported locales and the default values for the locale fields, see Supported Languages and Locales. For descriptions of each field, see the Collation Document MongoDB manual entry. \nCOLLATION EXAMPLES  SET A DEFAULT COLLATION ON A COLLECTION \nIn the following example, we create a new collection called souvenirs and assign a default collation with the \"fr_CA\" locale. The collation applies to all operations that support collation performed on that collection. // Create the collection with a collationdb.createCollection(\"souvenirs\", {  collation: { locale: \"fr_CA\" },});  Any of the operations that support collations automatically apply the collation defined on the collection. The query below searches the souvenirs collection and applies the \"fr_CA\" locale collation: myColl.find({type: \"photograph\"});  You can specify a different collation as a parameter in an operation that supports collations. The following query specifies the \"is\" Iceland locale and caseFirst optional parameter with the value \"upper\":  myColl.find({type: \"photograph\"},   { collation: { locale: \"is\", caseFirst: \"upper\" } } );  \nASSIGN A COLLATION TO AN INDEX \nIn the following example, we create a new index on the title field of a collection with a collation set to the \"en_US\" locale. myColl.createIndex(  { 'title' : 1 },  { 'collation' : { 'locale' : 'en_US' } });  The following query uses the index we created: myColl.find({\"year\": 1980}, {\"collation\" : {\"locale\" : \"en_US\" }})  .sort({\"title\": -1});  The following queries do not use the index that we created.

 \nCOLLATION QUERY EXAMPLES \nOperations that read, update, and delete documents from a collection can use collations. This section includes examples of a selection of these. See the MongoDB manual for a full list of operations that support collation. FIND() AND SORT() EXAMPLE \nThe following example calls both find() and sort() on a collection that uses the default binary collation. We use the German collation by setting the value of the locale parameter to de. myColl.find({ city: \"New York\" }, { collation: { locale: \"de\" } })  .sort({ name: 1 });  FINDONEANDUPDATE() EXAMPLE \nThe following example calls the findOneAndUpdate() operation on a collection that uses the default binary collation. The collection contains the following documents: { \"_id\" : 1, \"first_name\" : \"Hans\" }{ \"_id\" : 2, \"first_name\" : \"Gunter\" }{ \"_id\" : 3, \"first_name\" : \"Günter\" }{ \"_id\" : 4, \"first_name\" : \"Jürgen\" }  Consider the following findOneAndUpdate() operation on this collection which does not specify a collation: myColl.findOneAndUpdate(  { first_name : { $lt: \"Gunter\" } },  { $set: { verified: true } });  Since \"Gunter\" is the first sorted result when using a binary collation, none of the documents come lexically before and match the $lt comparison operator in the query document. As a result, the operation does not update any documents. Consider the same operation with a collation specified with the locale set to de@collation=phonebook. This locale specifies the collation=phonebook option which contains rules for prioritizing proper nouns, identified by capitalization of the first letter. The de@collation=phonebook locale and option sorts characters with umlauts before the same characters without umlauts. myColl.findOneAndUpdate(  { first_name: { $lt: \"Gunter\" } },  { $set: { verified: true } },  { collation: { locale: \"de@collation=phonebook\" } },);  Since \"Günter\" lexically comes before \"Gunter\" using the de@collation=phonebook collation specified in findOneAndUpdate(), the operation returns the following updated document: { lastErrorObject: { updatedExisting: true, n: 1 },  value: { _id: 3, first_name: 'Günter' },  ok: 1 }  FINDONEANDDELETE() EXAMPLE \nThe following example calls the findOneAndDelete() operation on a collection that uses the default binary collation and contains the following documents: { \"_id\" : 1, \"a\" : \"16\" }{ \"_id\" : 2, \"a\" : \"84\" }{ \"_id\" : 3, \"a\" : \"179\" }  In this example, we set the numericOrdering collation parameter to true to sort numeric strings based on their numerical order instead of their lexical order. myColl.findOneAndDelete(  { a: { $gt: \"100\" } },  { collation: { locale: \"en\", numericOrdering: true } },);  After you run the operation above, the collection contains the following documents: { \"_id\" : 1, \"a\" : \"16\" }{ \"_id\" : 2, \"a\" : \"84\" }  If you perform the same operation without collation on the original collection of three documents, it matches documents based on the lexical value of the strings (\"16\", \"84\", and \"179\"), and deletes the first document it finds that matches the query criteria. await myColl.findOneAndDelete({ a: { $gt: \"100\" } });  Since all the documents contain lexical values in the a field that match the criteria (greater than the lexical value of \"100\"), the operation removes the first result. After you run the operation above, the collection contains the following documents: { \"_id\" : 2, \"a\" : \"84\" }{ \"_id\" : 3, \"a\" : \"179\" }  AGGREGATION EXAMPLE \nTo use collation with the

Transaction Result \nOVERVIEW \nRead this guide to learn how to perform transactions in MongoDB using the Node.js driver. A transaction is a unit of work, composed of a series of operations that you want either to succeed together, or fail together when one or more of the operations fail. This behavior is called atomicity. Atomicity is a property in which transactions composed of one or more operations occur all at once, such that no other client can observe them as separate operations, and that it leaves no changes if one of the operations fails. Since all write operations on a single document in MongoDB are atomic, you may benefit most from transactions when you must make an atomic change that modifies multiple documents, which is called a multi-document transaction. Similar to write operations on a single document, multi-document transactions are ACID compliant, which means MongoDB guarantees the data involved in your transaction operations remains consistent, even if it encounters unexpected errors. Learn more from this MongoDB article on ACID transactions. You can use the driver to perform multi-document transactions. \nNOTE To run multi-document transactions, you must use MongoDB version 4.0 or later. For a detailed list of limitations, see the Transactions and Operations section in the server manual. In MongoDB, multi-document transactions run within a client session. A client session is a grouping of related read or write operations that you want to ensure run sequentially. When combined with majority read and write concerns, the driver can guarantee causal consistency between the operations. See the server manual guide on Client Sessions and Causal Consistency Guarantees for more information. Learn more about how to use the driver to run multi-document transactions on MongoDB in the following sections of this guide:      * Transaction APIs  * Transaction Settings  * Core API Examples \nTRANSACTION APIS \nUse the Core API to implement a transaction with the driver. To use the Core API, you declare the start and commit points of the transaction. \nCORE API \nThe Core API features methods to start, cancel, or commit a transaction. When you commit the transaction, you send a request to the server to make the changes from your operations atomically. When using this API, you must handle certain transaction errors returned by the server manually. See TransientTransactionError and UnknownTransactionCommitResult for more information on these errors. To start, cancel, or commit your transaction, you can call the corresponding method on the Session object:  * startTransaction()  * commitTransaction()  * abortTransaction() See the Core API example for a sample transaction implementation. \nTRANSACTION SETTINGS \nWhen you instantiate a transaction, you can specify the following options to set the default behavior for that transaction: Setting\nDescription\nreadConcern Specifies how to check for the consistency of the data that the read operations retrieve from replica sets. See Read Concern in the server manual for more information. writeConcern\nSpecifies conditions in which to acknowledge the write. See Write Concern in the server manual for more information.\nreadPreference\nSee Read Preference in the server manual for more information.\nmaxCommitTimeMS\nSpecifies the maximum amount of time to allow a commit action on a transaction to run in milliseconds. If you do not provide values, the driver uses the client settings. You can specify the transaction options in the Core API using code that resembles the following: const transactionOptions = {  readPreference: 'primary',  readConcern: { level: 'local' },  writeConcern: { w: 'majority' },  maxCommitTimeMS: 1000};session.startTransaction(transactionOptions);  \nEXAMPLES \nConsider a scenario in which a customer purchases items from your online store. To record the purchase, your application needs to update information related to inventory, the customer's orders, and register the order details. Suppose you organize the data updates as follows: Collection\nOperation\nDescription of the Change\norders\ninsert\nRecord the purchase information\ncustomers\nupdate\nAppend the order id to associate it with the customer\ninventory\nupdate\nSubtract quantity of ordered items A purchase can fail several ways such as if there's insufficient quantity of the item in inventory, if the order couldn't be completed, or if your payment system is offline. If the payment fails, you can use a transaction to make sure that you avoid exposing any partial updates that might cause data consistency issues for other operations that depend on that data.

 * Documents in the inventory collection that each track quantity and description of an item. The document in the customers collection in this example contains the following: { _id: 98765, orders: [] }  The documents in the inventory collection in this example contain the following: [ { name: \"sunblock\", sku: 5432, qty: 85 }, { name: \"beach towel\", sku: 7865, qty: 41 }]  The code examples also perform operations on the orders collection, but do not require any prior sample documents. The code examples use the cart and payment variables to represent a sample list of items purchased and the order payment details as follows: const cart = [  { name: 'sunblock', sku: 5432, qty: 1, price: 5.19 },  { name: 'beach towel', sku: 7865, qty: 2, price: 15.99 }];const payment = { customer: 98765, total: 37.17 };  \nIMPORTANT The examples in the following sections require that you create the collections outside of the transaction or that you are using MongoDB 4.4 or later. For more information on creating collections inside a transaction, see the Create Collections and Indexes in a Transaction server guide. \nCORE API IMPLEMENTATION \nThe code example in this section demonstrates how you can use the Core API to run the multi-document payment transaction in a session. This function shows how you can perform the following:  1. Start a session  2. Start a transaction, specifying transaction options  3. Perform data operations in the same session  4.

Docs Home → Node.js \nENTERPRISE AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS \nOn this page    \n * Kerberos (GSSAPI/SSPI)\n   \n * LDAP (PLAIN) In this guide, you can find sample code for connection to MongoDB with each authentication mechanism available in the MongoDB Enterprise Edition: Kerberos (GSSAPI/SSPI) and LDAP (PLAIN). \nKERBEROS (GSSAPI/SSPI)  NOTE The Node.js driver supports Kerberos on UNIX using the MIT Kerberos library and on Windows using the SSPI API. The GSSAPI authentication mechanism uses your user principal to authenticate to a Kerberos service. You can specify this authentication mechanism by setting the following parameters of the connection string:      * Set the authMechanism parameter to GSSAPI  * Set the SERVICE_NAME value in the authMechanismProperties parameter if using a value other than mongodb  * Specify a SERVICE_REALM value in the authMechanismProperties parameter if a custom service realm is required. \nIMPORTANT The gssapiServiceName parameter is deprecated and may be removed in future versions of the driver. Use authMechanismProperties=SERVICE_NAME:<your service name> in the connection URI instead. See the authMechanismProperties parameter documentation for more information. The following code sample authenticates to Kerberos for UNIX using GSSAPI. \nIMPORTANT Always URI encode the principal using the encodeURIComponent method to ensure it is correctly parsed. const { MongoClient } = require(\"mongodb\");\n// specify the placeholder values for your environment in the following linesconst clusterUrl = \"<MongoDB cluster URL>\";const principal = encodeURIComponent(\"<Kerberos principal and realm>\");const serviceRealm = \"<Kerberos service realm>\";const authMechanismProperties = `SERVICE_REALM:${serviceRealm}`;\nconst authMechanism = \"GSSAPI\";\n// Connection URIconst uri = `mongodb+srv://${principal}@${clusterUrl}/?authMechanism=${authMechanism}&authMechanismProperties=${authMechanismProperties}`;\nconst client = new MongoClient(uri);\n// Function to connect to the serverasync function run() {  try {    // Establish and verify connection    await client.db(\"admin\").command({ ping: 1 });    console.log(\"Connected successfully to server\");  } finally {    // Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error    await client.close();  }}run().catch(console.dir);  \nNOTE The method refers to the GSSAPI authentication mechanism instead of Kerberos because the driver authenticates via GSSAPI RFC-4652 the SASL mechanism. \nLDAP (PLAIN) \nThe PLAIN authentication mechanism uses your username and password to authenticate to a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server. You can specify this authentication mechanism by setting the authMechanism parameter to PLAIN and including your LDAP username and password in the connection string as shown in the following sample code. const { MongoClient } = require(\"mongodb\");\n// specify the placeholder values for your environment in the following linesconst clusterUrl = \"<MongoDB cluster URL>\";const ldapUsername = \"<LDAP username>\";const ldapPassword = \"<LDAP password>\";const authMechanism = \"PLAIN\";\n// Connection URIconst uri = `mongodb+srv://${ldapUsername}:${ldapPassword}@${clusterUrl}/?authMechanism=${authMechanism}`;\nconst client = new MongoClient(uri);\n// Function to connect to the serverasync function run() {  try {    // Establish and verify connection    await client.db(\"admin\").command({ ping: 1 });    console.log(\"Connected successfully to server\");  } finally {    // Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error    await client.close();  }}run().catch(console.dir);  \nNOTE The authentication mechanism is named PLAIN instead of LDAP since it authenticates using the PLAIN Simple

Set\n * Direct Connection This guide shows you how to connect to a MongoDB instance or replica set using the Node.js driver. \nCONNECTION URI \nThe connection URI is the set of instructions that the driver uses to connect to a MongoDB deployment. It instructs the driver on how it should connect to MongoDB and how it should behave while connected. The following example shows each part of the connection URI:  In this example, we use mongodb for the protocol, which specifies the Standard Connection String Format. If your instance or deployment has a DNS SRV record, you can use the DNS Seed List Connection Format for your connection string. This format offers more flexibility of deployment and the ability to change the servers in rotation without reconfiguring clients. \nNOTE To learn how to retrieve your connection string in Atlas, see the Atlas driver connection guide. The next part of the connection string contains your username and password if you are using password-based authentication. Replace the value of user with your username and pass with your password. If you are using an authentication mechanism that does not require a username and password, omit this part of the connection URI. The next part of the connection string specifies the hostname or IP address and port of your MongoDB instance. In the example above, we use sample.host as the hostname and 27017 as the port. Replace these values to point to your MongoDB instance. The last part of the connection string contains connection and authentication options as parameters. In the example above, we set two connection options: maxPoolSize=20 and w=majority. For more information on connection options, skip to the Connection Options section. The code below shows how you can use a connection URI in a client to connect to MongoDB. const { MongoClient } = require(\"mongodb\");\n// Connection URIconst uri = \"<connection string uri>\";\n// Create a new MongoClientconst client = new MongoClient(uri);\nasync function run() {  try {    // Connect the client to the server (optional starting in v4.7)    await client.connect();\n    // Establish and verify connection    await client.db(\"admin\").command({ ping: 1 });    console.log(\"Connected successfully to server\");  } finally {    // Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error    await client.close();  }}run().catch(console.dir);  \nOTHER WAYS TO CONNECT TO MONGODB \nIf you are connecting to a single MongoDB server instance or replica set that is not hosted on Atlas, see the following sections to find out how to connect. \nCONNECT TO A MONGODB SERVER ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE \nIf you need to run a MongoDB server on your local machine for development purposes instead of using an Atlas cluster, you need to complete the following:       1. Download the Community or Enterprise version of MongoDB Server.  2. Install and configure MongoDB Server.  3. Start the server. \nIMPORTANT Always secure your MongoDB server from malicious attacks. See our Security Checklist for a list of security recommendations. After you successfully start your MongoDB server, specify your connection string in your driver connection code. If your MongoDB Server is running locally, you can use the following connection string: mongodb://localhost:<port>  In this connection string, <port> is the port number on which you configured your server to listen for incoming connections. If you need to specify a different hostname or IP address, see our Server Manual entry on Connection Strings. To test whether you can connect to your server, replace the connection string in the Connect to MongoDB code example and run it. \nCONNECT TO A REPLICA SET \nA MongoDB replica set deployment is a group of connected instances that store the same set of data. This configuration of instances provides data redundancy and high data availability. To connect to a replica set deployment, specify the hostname and port numbers of each instance, separated by a comma, and the replica set name as the value of the replicaSet parameter in the connection string. mongodb://host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017/?replicaSet=myRs  When making a connection, the driver takes the following actions by default:  * Discovers all replica set members

Docs Home → Node.js \nAUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS \nOn this page    \n * DEFAULT\n   \n * SCRAM-SHA-256\n * SCRAM-SHA-1\n * MONGODB-CR\n * MONGODB-AWS\n * X.509\n * TLS/SSL Options In this guide, you can find sample code for connection to MongoDB with each authentication mechanism available in the MongoDB Community Edition: DEFAULT, SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-1, MONGODB-CR, MONGODB-AWS, and X.509. \nDEFAULT \nThe DEFAULT authentication mechanism is a fallback setting that instructs the driver to negotiate the first authentication mechanism supported by the server in the following order of preference:       1. SCRAM-SHA-256  2. SCRAM-SHA-1  3. MONGODB-CR If the DEFAULT option is specified, the driver first attempts to authenticate using SCRAM-SHA-256. If the version of the MongoDB instance does not support that mechanism, the driver attempts to authenticate using SCRAM-SHA-1. If the instance does not support that mechanism either, the driver attempts to authenticate using MONGODB-CR. You can specify this authentication mechanism by setting the authMechanism parameter to DEFAULT in the connection string, or by omitting the parameter since it is the default value. Also include your username and password as shown in the code below. \nIMPORTANT Always URI encode the username and password using the encodeURIComponent method to ensure they are correctly parsed. const { MongoClient } = require(\"mongodb\");\n// Replace the following with values for your environment.const username = encodeURIComponent(\"<username>\");const password = encodeURIComponent(\"<password>\");const clusterUrl = \"<MongoDB cluster url>\";\nconst authMechanism = \"DEFAULT\";\n// Replace the following with your MongoDB deployment's connection string.const uri =  `mongodb+srv://${username}:${password}@${clusterUrl}/?authMechanism=${authMechanism}`;\n// Create a new MongoClientconst client = new MongoClient(uri);\n// Function to connect to the serverasync function run() {  try {    // Establish and verify connection    await client.db(\"admin\").command({ ping: 1 });    console.log(\"Connected successfully to server\");  } finally {    // Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error    await client.close();  }}run().catch(console.dir);  For more information on the challenge-response (CR) and salted challenge-response authentication mechanisms (SCRAM) that MongoDB supports, see the SCRAM section of the manual. \nSCRAM-SHA-256  NOTE SCRAM-SHA-256 is the default authentication method for MongoDB starting in version 4.0 SCRAM-SHA-256 is a salted challenge-response authentication mechanism (SCRAM) that uses your username and password, encrypted with the SHA-256 algorithm to authenticate your user. You can specify this authentication mechanism by setting the authMechanism to the value SCRAM-SHA-256 in the connection string as shown in the following sample code. \nIMPORTANT Always URI encode the username and password using the encodeURIComponent method to ensure they are correctly parsed. const { MongoClient } = require(\"mongodb\");\n// Replace the following with values for your environment.const username = encodeURIComponent(\"<username>\");const password = encodeURIComponent(\"<password>\");const clusterUrl = \"<MongoDB cluster url>\";\nconst authMechanism = \"SCRAM-SHA-256\";\n// Replace the following with your MongoDB deployment's connection string.const uri =  `mongodb+srv://${username}:${password}@${clusterUrl}/?authMechanism=${authMechanism}`;\n// Create a new MongoClientconst client = new MongoClient(uri);\n// Function to connect to the serverasync function run() {  try {    // Establish and verify connection    await client.db(\"admin\").command({ ping: 1 });    console.log(\"Connected successfully to server\");  } finally {    // Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error    await client.close();

You can specify this option by setting the authMechanism parameter to value MONGODB-CR in the connection string as shown in the following sample code. \nIMPORTANT Always URI encode the username and password using the encodeURIComponent method to ensure they are correctly parsed. const { MongoClient } = require(\"mongodb\");\n// Replace the following with values for your environment.const username = encodeURIComponent(\"<username>\");const password = encodeURIComponent(\"<password>\");const clusterUrl = \"<MongoDB cluster url>\";\n// Replace the following with your MongoDB deployment's connection string.const uri =  `mongodb+srv://${username}:${password}@${clusterUrl}/?authMechanism=${authMechanism}&tls=true&tlsCertificateKeyFile=${clientPEMFile}`;\n// Create a new MongoClientconst client = new MongoClient(uri);\n// Function to connect to the serverasync function run() {  try {    // Establish and verify connection    await client.db(\"admin\").command({ ping: 1 });    console.log(\"Connected successfully to server\");  } finally {    // Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error    await client.close();  }}run().catch(console.dir);  \nIMPORTANT If you have upgraded the authentication schema from MONGODB-CR to SCRAM, any MONGODB-CR user authentication requests fail. \nMONGODB-AWS  NOTE The MONGODB-AWS authentication mechanism is only available in MongoDB versions 4.4 and later. The MONGODB-AWS authentication mechanism uses your Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) credentials to authenticate your user. If you do not already have the AWS signature library, install it using the following npm command: npm install aws4  To connect to a MongoDB instance with MONGODB-AWS authentication enabled, specify the MONGODB-AWS authentication mechanism. The driver checks for your credentials in the following sources in order:  1. Connection string  2. Environment variables  3. AWS ECS endpoint specified in AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI  4. AWS EC2 endpoint. For more information, see IAM Roles for Tasks. \nIMPORTANT The driver only reads the credentials from the first method that it detects in the order as given by the preceding list. For example, if you specify your AWS credentials in the connection string, the driver ignores any credentials that you specified in environment variables.

Docs Home → Node.js \nCONNECTION OPTIONS \nThis section explains the MongoDB connection and authentication options supported by the driver. You can pass the connection options as parameters of the connection URI to specify the behavior of the client. Name\nAccepted Values\nDefault Value\nDescription\nappname\nstring\nnull\nSpecifies the app name the driver passes to the server in the client metadata as part of the connection handshake. The server prints the appname to the MongoDB logs upon establishing the connection. It is also recorded in the slow query logs and profile collections.\nauthMechanism\nstring\nnull\nSpecifies the authentication mechanism method to use for connection to the server. If you do not specify a value, the driver uses the default mechanism, either SCRAM-SHA-1 or SCRAM-SHA-256 depending on the server version. See authentication mechanism for available authentication mechanisms.\nauthMechanismProperties\ncomma separated key:value pairs, e.g. \"opt1:val1,opt2:val2\"\nnull\nSpecifies additional options provided for authentication, such as enabling hostname canonicalization for GSSAPI.\nauthSource\nstring\nnull\nSpecifies the database that connections should authenticate against.\ncompressors\ncomma separated list of strings, e.g. \"snappy,zlib,zstd\"\nnull\nSpecifies the allowed compression types for wire protocol messages sent to or received from the server. See Network Compression for more information.\nconnectTimeoutMS\nnon-negative integer\n30000\nSpecifies the amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait to establish a single TCP socket connection to the server before raising an error. Specifying 0 disables the connection timeout.\ndirectConnection\nboolean\nfalse\nSpecifies whether to force dispatch all operations to the host specified in the connection URI.\nheartbeatFrequencyMS\ninteger greater than or equal to 500\nnull\nSpecifies the interval, in milliseconds, between regular server monitoring checks.\njournal\nboolean\nnull\nSpecifies the default write concern \"j\" field for the client.

guide shows you how to monitor topology events in a MongoDB instance, replica set, or sharded cluster. The driver creates topology events, also known as Server Discovery and Monitoring (SDAM) events, when there is a change in the state of the instance or cluster that you connected to. For example, the driver creates an event when you establish a new connection or if the cluster elects a new primary. Read this guide if you need to record topology changes in your application or want to explore the information provided in these events. \nEVENT SUBSCRIPTION EXAMPLE \nYou can access one or more SDAM events using the driver by subscribing to them in your application. The following example demonstrates connecting to a replica set and subscribing to one of the SDAM events created by the MongoDB deployment: const { MongoClient } = require(\"mongodb\");\n// Replace the following with your MongoDB deployment's connection// string.const uri =  \"mongodb+srv://<clusterUrl>/?replicaSet=rs&writeConcern=majority\";\nconst client = new MongoClient(uri);\n// Replace <event name> with the name of the event you are subscribing to.const eventName = \"<event name>\";client.on(eventName, event => {  console.log(`received ${eventName}: ${JSON.stringify(event, null, 2)}`);});\nasync function run() {  try {    // Establish and verify connection    await client.db(\"admin\").command({ ping: 1 });    console.log(\"Connected successfully\");  } finally {    // Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error    await client.close();  }}run().catch(console.dir);  \nEVENT DESCRIPTIONS \nYou can subscribe to any of the following SDAM events: Event

\nOVERVIEW \nMost CRUD operations allow you to narrow the set of matched documents by specifying matching criteria in a query document. Query documents contain one or more query operators that apply to specific fields which determine which documents to include in the result set. In a query document, you can match fields against literal values (e.g. { title: 'The Room' }) or you can compose query operators to express more complex matching criteria. In this guide, we cover the following categories of query operators in MongoDB and show examples on how to use them:      * Comparison Operators  * Logical Operators  * Element Operators  * Evaluation Operators To follow along with the examples in this guide, use the following code snippet to insert documents that describe fruits into the myDB.fruits collection: const myDB = client.db(\"myDB\");const myColl = myDB.collection(\"fruits\");\nawait myColl.insertMany([  { \"_id\": 1, \"name\": \"apples\", \"qty\": 5, \"rating\": 3 },  { \"_id\": 2, \"name\": \"bananas\", \"qty\": 7, \"rating\": 1, \"microsieverts\": 0.1 },  { \"_id\": 3, \"name\": \"oranges\", \"qty\": 6, \"rating\": 2 },  { \"_id\": 4, \"name\": \"avocados\", \"qty\": 3, \"rating\": 5 },]);  \nNOTE Your query operation may return a reference to a cursor that contains matching documents. To learn how to examine data stored in the cursor, see the Cursor Fundamentals page. \nLITERAL VALUE QUERIES \nLiteral value queries allow you to query for data that exactly matches a value you provide in the query document. A literal value query has two parts: a field name and a value. Documents returned from such a query must contain a field that has exactly the same name as the provided name and a value for that field that is exactly the same as the provided value. The following operation uses a literal query to search for documents containing a field called \"name\" that has a value of \"apples\": const query = { \"name\": \"apples\" };const cursor = myColl.find(query);await cursor.forEach(console.dir);  This code snippet returns the following results: { \"_id\": 1, \"name\": \"apples\", \"qty\": 5, \"rating\": 3 } \nNOTE Literal value queries are equivalent to the $eq comparison operator. As a result, the following two queries are equivalent: myColl.find({   rating: { $eq: 5 }});  myColl.find({   rating: 5});  \nCOMPARISON OPERATORS \nComparison operators allow you to query for data based on comparisons with values in a collection. Common comparison operators include $gt for \"greater than\" comparisons, $lt for \"less than\" comparisons, and $ne for \"not equal to\" comparisons. The following operation uses the comparison operator $gt to search for documents with a quantity value greater than 5 and prints them out: // $gt means \"greater than\"const query = { qty: { $gt : 5 } };const cursor = myColl.find(query);await cursor.forEach(console.dir);  This code snippet returns the following results: { \"_id\": 2, \"name\": \"bananas\", \"qty\": 7, \"rating\": 1 }{ \"_id\": 3, \"name\": \"oranges\", \"qty\": 6, \"rating\": 2 } \nLOGICAL OPERATORS \nLogical operators allow you to query for data using logic applied to the results of field-level operators. For instance, you can use the $or method to query for documents that match either a $gt comparison operator or a literal value query. The following operation uses the logical operator $not to search for documents with a quantity value that is not greater than 5 and prints them out: const query = { qty: { $not: { $gt: 5 }}};const cursor = myColl.find(query);await cursor.forEach(console.dir);  This code snippet returns the following results: { \"_id\": 4, \"name\": \"avocados\", \"qty\": 3, \"rating\": 5 }{ \"_id\": 1,

Docs Home → Node.js \nLIMIT THE NUMBER OF RETURNED RESULTS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Sample Documents\n * Limit\n * Skip \nOVERVIEW \nUse limit to cap the number of documents that can be returned from a read operation. limit functions as a cap on the maximum number of documents that the operation can return, but the operation can return a smaller number of documents if there are not enough documents present to reach the limit. If limit is used with the skip method, the skip applies first and the limit only applies to the documents left over after the skip. \nSAMPLE DOCUMENTS \nTo follow along with the examples in this guide, use the following code snippet to insert documents that describe books into the myDB.books collection: const myDB = client.db(\"myDB\");const myColl = myDB.collection(\"books\");\nawait myColl.insertMany([  { \"_id\": 1, \"name\": \"The Brothers Karamazov\", \"author\": \"Dostoyevsky\", \"length\": 824 },  { \"_id\": 2, \"name\": \"Les Misérables\", \"author\": \"Hugo\", \"length\": 1462 },  { \"_id\": 3, \"name\": \"Atlas Shrugged\", \"author\": \"Rand\", \"length\": 1088 },  { \"_id\": 4, \"name\": \"Infinite Jest\", \"author\": \"Wallace\", \"length\": 1104 },  { \"_id\": 5, \"name\": \"Cryptonomicon\", \"author\": \"Stephenson\", \"length\": 918 },  { \"_id\": 6, \"name\": \"A Dance With Dragons\", \"author\": \"Tolkein\", \"length\": 1104 },]);  \nNOTE Your query operation may return a reference to a cursor that contains matching documents. To learn how to examine data stored in the cursor, see the Cursor Fundamentals page. \nLIMIT \nThe following example queries the collection to return the top three longest books. It matches all the documents with the query, applies a sort on the length field to return books with longer lengths before books, and applies a limit to return only 3 results: // define an empty query documentconst query = {};// sort in descending (-1) order by lengthconst sort = { length: -1 };const limit = 3;const cursor = myColl.find(query).sort(sort).limit(limit);await cursor.forEach(console.dir);  The code example above outputs the following three documents, sorted by length: { \"_id\": 2, \"title\": \"Les Misérables\", \"author\": \"Hugo\", \"length\": 1462 }{ \"_id\": 6, \"title\": \"A Dance With Dragons\", \"author\": \"Martin\", \"length\": 1104 }{ \"_id\": 4, \"title\": \"Infinite Jest\", \"author\": \"Wallace\", \"length\": 1104 } \nNOTE The order in which you call limit and sort does not matter because the driver reorders the calls to apply the sort first and the limit after it. The following two calls are equivalent: myColl.find(query).sort({ length: -1 }).limit(3);myColl.find(query).limit(3).sort({ length: -1 });  You can also apply sort and limit by specifying them in an options object in your call to the find() method. The following two calls are equivalent: myColl.find(query).sort({ length: -1 }).limit(3);myColl.find(query, { sort: { length: -1 }, limit: 3 });  For more information on the options settings for the find() method, see the API documentation on find(). \nSKIP \nTo see the next three books in the results, append the skip() method, passing the number of documents to bypass as shown below: // define an empty query documentconst query = {};// sort in descending (-1) order by lengthconst sort = { length: -1 };const limit = 3;const skip = 3;const cursor = myColl.find(query).sort(sort).limit(limit).skip(skip);await cursor.forEach(console.dir);  This operation returns the documents that describe the fourth through sixth books in order of

Docs Home → Node.js \nRETRIEVE DATA \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Find\n * Aggregate\n * Watch / Subscribe \nOVERVIEW \nYou can use read operations to retrieve data from your MongoDB database. There are multiple types of read operations that access the data in different ways. If you want to request results based on a set of criteria from the existing set of data, you can use a find operation such as the find() or findOne() methods. You can also further specify the information you are requesting by including additional parameters or by chaining other methods such as:      * Sort Results  * Skip Returned Results  * Limit the Number of Returned Results  * Specify Which Fields to Return You can also use an aggregation operation to retrieve data. This type of operation allows you to apply an ordered pipeline of transformations to the matched data. If you want to monitor the database for incoming data that matches a set of criteria, you can use the watch operation to be notified in real-time when matching data is inserted. \nNOTE Your query operation may return a reference to a cursor that contains matching documents. To learn how to examine data stored in the cursor, see the Cursor Fundamentals page. \nFIND \nThe find() method is called on the Collection object that references the collection you want to query. The method accepts a query document that describes the documents you want to retrieve. For more information on how to specify your query document, see our guide on how to Specify a Query. If you resolve the Promise returned by find(), you receive a reference to a Cursor with which you can navigate matched documents. If you resolve the Promise returned by findOne(), you receive the matching document or null if there are no matches. \nEXAMPLE A pizza restaurant wants to find all pizzas ordered by Lemony Snicket yesterday. They run the following find() query on the orders collection:     const findResult = await orders.find({      name: \"Lemony Snicket\",      date: {        $gte: new Date(new Date().setHours(00, 00, 00)),        $lt: new Date(new Date().setHours(23, 59, 59)),      },    });  Once the operation returns, the findResult variable references a Cursor. You can print the documents retrieved using the forEach() method as shown below: await cursor.forEach(console.dir);  The output might resemble the following: [  { name: \"Lemony Snicket\", type: \"horseradish pizza\", qty: 1, status: \"delivered\", date: ... },  { name: \"Lemony Snicket\", type: \"coal-fired oven pizza\", qty: 3, status: \"canceled\", date: ...},  ...] See the find() and findOne() for fully-runnable examples. \nAGGREGATE \nIf you want to run a custom processing pipeline to retrieve data from your database, you can use the aggregate() method. This method accepts aggregation expressions to run in sequence. These expressions let you filter, group, and arrange the result data from a collection. \nEXAMPLE A pizza restaurant wants to run a status report on-demand to summarize pizza orders over the past week. They run the following aggregate() query on the orders collection to fetch the totals for each distinct \"status\" field:     const aggregateResult = await orders.aggregate([      {        $match: {          date: {            $gte: new Date(new Date().getTime() - 1000 * 3600 * 24 * 7),            $lt: new Date(),          },        },      },      {        $group: {          _id: \"$status\",          count: {            $sum: 1,          },        },      },    ]);  Once the operation returns, the aggregateResult variable references a Cursor.

using the $text query operator, lets you search string type fields in your collection for words or phrases. This operator performs a logical OR on each term separated by a space in the search string. You can also specify additional options to the operator to handle case sensitivity, word stemming (e.g. plural forms, tense) and stop words for a supported language. This is particularly useful for unstructured text such as transcripts, essays, or web pages. The $text query operator requires that you specify the search field in a text index on your collection. See the examples below for sample code for creating a text index and using the $text query operator. \nNOTE Atlas Search makes it easy to build fast, relevance-based search capabilities on top of your MongoDB data. Try it today on MongoDB Atlas, our fully managed database as a service. \nEXAMPLES \nThe following examples use the movies collection in the sample_mflix database. In order to enable text searches on the title field, create the text index using the following command: db.movies.createIndex({ title: \"text\" });  We use this text index for the examples, but you can create a compound text index that broadens your text queries to multiple fields as follows: db.movies.createIndex({ title: \"text\", fullplot: \"text\" });  You can only create one text index per collection. Every text search queries all the fields specified in that index for matches. See the MongoDB server manual for more information on creating text indexes. \nQUERY FOR WORDS \nThis example queries for Star Trek movies by searching for titles containing the word \"trek\". If you want to query using multiple words, separate your words with spaces to query for documents that match any of the search terms (logical OR).   const query = { $text: { $search: \"trek\" } };\n  // Return only the `title` of each matched document  const projection = {    _id: 0,    title: 1,  };\n  // find documents based on our query and projection  const cursor = movies.find(query).project(projection);  This operation returns the following documents: { title: 'Trek Nation' }{ title: 'Star Trek' }{ title: 'Star Trek Into Darkness' }{ title: 'Star Trek: Nemesis' }{ title: 'Star Trek: Insurrection' }{ title: 'Star Trek: Generations' }{ title: 'Star Trek: First Contact' }{ title: 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' }{ title: 'Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country' }{ title: 'Star Trek V: The Final Frontier' }{ title: 'Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home' }{ title: 'Star Trek III: The Search for Spock' }{ title: 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' } Success! The query found every document in the movies collection with a title including the word \"trek\". Unfortunately, the search included one unintended item: \"Trek Nation,\" which is a movie about Star Trek and not part of the Star Trek movie series. To solve this, we can query with a more specific phrase. \nQUERY BY PHRASE \nTo make your query more specific, try using the phrase \"star trek\" instead of just the word \"trek\". To search by phrase, surround your multi-word phrase with escaped quotes (\\\"<term>\\\"):   const query = { $text: { $search: \"\\\"star trek\\\"\" } };\n  // Return only the `title` of each matched document  const projection = {    _id: 0,    title: 1,  };\n  // find documents based on our query and projection  const cursor = movies.find(query).project(projection);  Querying by the phrase \"star

Docs Home → Node.js \nSORT RESULTS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Sample Documents\n * Example \nOVERVIEW \nUse sort to change the order in which read operations return documents. Sort tells MongoDB to order returned documents by the values of one or more fields in a certain direction. To sort returned documents by a field in ascending (lowest first) order, use a value of 1. To sort in descending (greatest first) order instead, use -1. If you do not specify a sort, MongoDB does not guarantee the order of query results. \nSAMPLE DOCUMENTS \nFollow the instructions in the examples below to insert data into the myDB.books collection and perform a sort on the results of a query. Consider a collection containing documents that describe books. To insert this data into a collection, run the following operation: const myDB = client.db(\"myDB\");const myColl = myDB.collection(\"books\");\nawait myColl.insertMany([  { \"_id\": 1, \"name\": \"The Brothers Karamazov\", \"author\": \"Dostoyevsky\", \"length\": 824 },  { \"_id\": 2, \"name\": \"Les Misérables\", \"author\": \"Hugo\", \"length\": 1462 },  { \"_id\": 3, \"name\": \"Atlas Shrugged\", \"author\": \"Rand\", \"length\": 1088 },  { \"_id\": 4, \"name\": \"Infinite Jest\", \"author\": \"Wallace\", \"length\": 1104 },  { \"_id\": 5, \"name\": \"Cryptonomicon\", \"author\": \"Stephenson\", \"length\": 918 },  { \"_id\": 6, \"name\": \"A Dance with Dragons\", \"author\": \"Martin\", \"length\": 1104 },]);  \nNOTE Your query operation may return a reference to a cursor that contains matching documents. To learn how to examine data stored in the cursor, see the Cursor Fundamentals page. \nEXAMPLE \nPass the following sort document to a read operation to ensure that the operation returns books with longer lengths before books with shorter lengths: // define an empty query documentconst query = {};// sort in descending (-1) order by lengthconst sort = { length: -1 };const cursor = myColl.find(query).sort(sort);await cursor.forEach(console.dir);  In this case, the number -1 tells the read operation to sort the books in descending order by length. find() returns the following documents when this sort is used with an empty query: { \"_id\": 2, \"title\": \"Les Misérables\", \"author\": \"Hugo\", \"length\": 1462 }{ \"_id\": 4, \"title\": \"Infinite Jest\", \"author\": \"Wallace\", \"length\": 1104 }{ \"_id\": 6, \"title\": \"A Dance with Dragons\", \"author\": \"Martin\", \"length\": 1104 }{ \"_id\": 3, \"title\": \"Atlas Shrugged\", \"author\": \"Rand\", \"length\": 1088 }{ \"_id\": 5, \"title\": \"Cryptonomicon\", \"author\": \"Stephenson\", \"length\": 918 }{ \"_id\": 1, \"title\": \"The Brothers Karamazov\", \"author\": \"Dostoyevsky\", \"length\": 824 } Sometimes, the order of two or more documents is ambiguous using a specified sort. In the above case, both \"A Dance with Dragons\" and \"Infinite Jest\" have 1104 pages, so the order in which they are returned is not guaranteed. To resolve ties in your sorted results in a repeatable way, add additional fields to the sort document: // define an empty query documentconst query = {};// sort in ascending (1) order by lengthconst sort = { length: 1, author: 1 };const cursor = myColl.find(query).sort(sort);await cursor.forEach(console.dir);  With the addition of the author field to the sort document, the read operation sorts matching documents first by length and, in the event of a tie, then by author. Matched document fields are compared in the same order as fields are specified in the sort document. find() returns the following ordering of documents when this sort is used on the documents matching

A connection pool is a set of open TCP connections your driver maintains with a MongoDB instance. Connection pools help reduce the number of network handshakes your application needs to perform and can help your application run faster. Read this guide if you need to record connection pool events in your application or want to explore the information provided in these events. \nEVENT SUBSCRIPTION EXAMPLE \nYou can access one or more connection pool events using the driver by subscribing to them in your application. The following example demonstrates connecting to a replica set and subscribing to one of the connection pool monitoring events created by the MongoDB deployment: const { MongoClient } = require(\"mongodb\");\n// Replace the following with your MongoDB deployment's connection// string.const uri =  \"mongodb+srv://<clusterUrl>/?replicaSet=rs&writeConcern=majority\";\nconst client = new MongoClient(uri);\n// Replace <event name> with the name of the event you are subscribing to.const eventName = \"<event name>\";client.on(eventName, (event) =>  console.log(\"\\nreceived event:\\n\", event));\nasync function run() {  try {    // Establish and verify connection    await client.db(\"admin\").command({ ping: 1 });    console.log(\"\\nConnected successfully!\\n\");  } finally {    // Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error    await client.close();  }}run().catch(console.dir);  \nEVENT DESCRIPTIONS \nYou can subscribe to any of the following connection pool monitoring events: Event Name\nDescription\nconnectionPoolCreated\nCreated when a connection pool is created.\nconnectionPoolReady\nCreated when a connection pool is

Docs Home → Node.js \nSEARCH GEOSPATIALLY \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Coordinates on an Earth-like Sphere\n * Coordinates on a 2D Plane\n * Examples\n * Query by Proximity\n * Query Within a Range \nOVERVIEW \nYou can query data based on geographical location using geospatial query operators. You can format geospatial queries using one of the following coordinate systems:      * Coordinates on an Earth-like Sphere  * Coordinates on a 2D Plane This section contains examples of geospatial queries using different query operators that you can run against your Atlas sample dataset. \nCOORDINATES ON AN EARTH-LIKE SPHERE \nFor geospatial queries using longitude and latitude coordinates on an Earth-like sphere, use the GeoJSON query format. While GeoJSON has multiple types, all GeoJSON data types use some form of the following structure: <field> : {   type: <GeoJSON type>,   coordinates: [      [longitude_1, latitude_1],      ...      [longitude_n, latitude_n]   ]}  The object type determines the number of coordinates. For instance, a Point requires only one coordinate: a longitude and a latitude. A Line uses two coordinates: a longitude and a latitude for each end. A Polygon consists of a list of coordinates in which the first and last coordinate are the same, effectively closing the polygon. To learn more about the GeoJSON shapes you can use in MongoDB, consult the GeoJSON manual entry. To enable querying GeoJSON data, you must add the field to a 2dsphere index. The following snippet creates an index on the location.geo field in the theaters collection using the createIndex() method: db.theaters.createIndex({location.geo: \"2dsphere\"});  \nCOORDINATES ON A 2D PLANE \nYou can also express geospatial queries using x and y coordinates in a two-dimentional Euclidian plane. Until MongoDB, this was the only format compatible with geospatial queries, and are now referred to as \"legacy coordinate pairs\". Legacy coordinate pairs use the following structure: <field> : [ x, y ]  The field should contain an array of two values in which the first represents the x axis value and the second represents the y axis value. To enable querying using legacy coordinate pairs, create a 2d index on the field on the collection. The following snippet creates an index on the coordinates field in the shipwrecks collection using the createIndex() method: db.shipwrecks({coordinates: \"2d\"});  See the MongoDB server manual page on legacy coordinate pairs for more information. \nNOTE Spherical (2dsphere) and flat (2d) indexes support some, but not all, of the same query operators. For a full list of operators and their index compatibility, consult the manual entry for geospatial queries. \nEXAMPLES \nThe following examples use the MongoDB Atlas sample dataset. You can learn how to set up your own free-tier Atlas cluster and how to load the sample dataset in our quick start guide. The examples use the theaters collection in the sample_mflix database from the sample dataset. The theaters collection contains a 2dsphere index on the location.geo field. \nQUERY BY PROXIMITY \nThe $near operator accepts a set of longitude-latitude coordinates and returns documents ordered from nearest to farthest. To limit the results to a maximum distance in meters, use the $maxDistance option. For a complete list of options, see the reference documentation for $near. The following example queries for theaters within 10,000 meters of [ -73.9667, 40.78 ].   const query = {    \"location.geo\": {      $near: {        $geometry: { type: \"Point\", coordinates: [-73.9667, 40.78] },        $maxDistance: 10000,      },    },  };\n  // find documents based on our query  const cursor = theaters.find(query);  \nQUERY WITHIN A RANGE \nThe $geoWithin operator selects documents with geospatial data that exist within a specified shape.

Iteration\n * Manual Iteration\n * Stream API\n * Event API\n * Cursor Utility Methods\n * Rewind\n * Close \nOVERVIEW \nRead operations that return multiple documents do not immediately return all values matching the query. Because a query can potentially match very large sets of documents, these operations rely upon an object called a cursor. A cursor fetches documents in batches to reduce both memory consumption and network bandwidth usage. Cursors are highly configurable and offer multiple interaction paradigms for different use cases. The following functions directly return cursors:      * Collection.find()  * Collection.aggregate()  * Collection.listIndexes()  * Db.aggregate()  * Db.listCollections() Other methods such as Collection.findOne() and Collection.watch() use cursors internally, and return the results of the operations instead of a cursor. \nCURSOR PARADIGMS \nYou can work with cursors using a number of cursor paradigms. Most cursor paradigms allow you to access query results one document at a time, abstracting away network and caching logic. However, since use cases differ, other paradigms offer different access patterns, like pulling all matching documents into a collection in process memory. \nWARNING Do not combine different cursor paradigms on a single cursor. Operations such as hasNext(), forEach(), and toArray() each predictably modify the original cursor. If you mix these calls on a single cursor, you may receive unexpected results. \nWARNING Because asynchronous calls directly modify the cursor, executing asynchronous calls on a single cursor simultaneously can also cause undefined behaviour. Always wait for the previous asynchronous operation to complete before running another. \nNOTE When you reach the last result through iteration or through an at-once fetch, the cursor is exhausted which means it ceases to respond to methods that access the results. \nFOR EACH FUNCTIONAL ITERATION \nYou can pass a function to the forEach() method of any cursor to iterate through results in a functional style:   const cursor = myColl.find({});  await cursor.forEach(doc => console.log(doc));  \nRETURN AN ARRAY OF ALL DOCUMENTS \nFor use cases that require all documents matched by a query to be held in memory at the same time, use toArray(). Note that large numbers of matched documents can cause performance issues or failures if the operation exceeds memory constraints. Consider using forEach() to iterate through results unless you want to return all documents at once.   const cursor = myColl.find({});  const allValues = await cursor.toArray();  \nASYNCHRONOUS ITERATION \nCursors implement the AsyncIterator interface, which allows you to use cursors in for...``await`` loops:   const cursor = myColl.find({});  console.log(\"async\");  for await (const doc of cursor) {    console.log(doc);  }  \nMANUAL ITERATION \nYou can use the hasNext() method to check if a cursor can provide additional data, and then use the next() method to retrieve the subsequent element of the cursor:   const cursor = myColl.find({});\n  while (await cursor.hasNext()) {    console.log(await cursor.next());  }  \nSTREAM API \nCursors expose the stream() method to convert them to Node Readable Streams. These streams operate in Object Mode, which passes JavaScript objects rather than Buffers or Strings through the pipeline.   const cursor = myColl.find({});  cursor.stream().on(\"data\", doc => console.log(doc));  \nEVENT API \nAs Readable Streams, cursors also support the Event API's close, data, end and readable events:   const cursor = myColl.find({});  // the \"data\" event is fired once per document  cursor.on(\"data\", data => console.log(data));  \nCURSOR UTILITY METHODS  REWIND \nTo reset a cursor to its initial position in the set of returned documents, use rewind().   const cursor = myColl.find({});  const firstResult = await cursor.toArray();  console.log(\"First count: \" + firstResult.length);  await cursor.rewind();  const secondResult = await cursor.toArray();

Parameter\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nUse the distinct() method to retrieve all distinct values for a specified field across a collection. \nSAMPLE DOCUMENTS \nTo follow along with the examples in this guide, use the following code snippet to insert documents that describe restaurants into the myDB.restaurants collection: const myDB = client.db(\"myDB\");const myColl = myDB.collection(\"restaurants\");\nawait myColl.insertMany([  { \"_id\": 1, \"restaurant\": \"White Bear\", \"borough\": \"Queens\", \"cuisine\": \"Chinese\" },  { \"_id\": 2, \"restaurant\": \"Via Carota\", \"borough\": \"Manhattan\", \"cuisine\": \"Italian\" },  { \"_id\": 3, \"restaurant\": \"Borgatti's\", \"borough\": \"Bronx\", \"cuisine\": \"Italian\" },  { \"_id\": 4, \"restaurant\": \"Tanoreen\", \"borough\": \"Brooklyn\", \"cuisine\": \"Middle Eastern\" },  { \"_id\": 5, \"restaurant\": \"Äpfel\", \"borough\": \"Queens\", \"cuisine\": \"German\" },  { \"_id\": 6, \"restaurant\": \"Samba Kitchen\", \"borough\": \"Manhattan\", \"cuisine\": \"Brazilian\" },]);  \nNOTE Your query operation may return a reference to a cursor that contains matching documents. To learn how to examine data stored in the cursor, see the Cursor Fundamentals page. \nDISTINCT \nThe distinct() method requires a document field as a parameter. You can specify the following optional parameters to adjust the method output:      * A query parameter to refine your results  * An options parameter to set collation rules \nDOCUMENT FIELD PARAMETER \nPass the name of the document field to return a list of the field's unique values. \nEXAMPLE \nThe \"Queens\" and \"Manhattan\" borough values each appear more than once in the sample documents. However, the following example retrieves the unique values of the borough field: // specify \"borough\" as the field to return values forconst cursor = myColl.distinct(\"borough\");await cursor.forEach(console.dir);  This code outputs the following borough values: [ \"Bronx\", \"Brooklyn\", \"Manhattan\", \"Queens\" ] \nQUERY PARAMETER \nYou can specify a query parameter to return unique values for documents that match your query. Visit Specify a Query for more information on constructing a query filter. EXAMPLE \nThe following example outputs the distinct values of the cuisine field but excludes restaurants in \"Brooklyn\": // exclude Brooklyn restaurants from the outputconst query = { borough: { $ne: \"Brooklyn\" }};\n// find the filtered distinct values of \"cuisine\"const cursor = myColl.distinct(\"cuisine\", query);await cursor.forEach(console.dir);  In this case, the query filter matches every borough value except for \"Brooklyn\". This prevents distinct() from outputting one cuisine value, \"Middle Eastern\". The code outputs the following values: [ \"Brazilian\", \"Chinese\", \"German\", \"Italian\" ] \nOPTIONS PARAMETER \nYou can specify the collation to the distinct() method by defining a collation field as an options parameter. This field allows you to set regional rules for string ordering and comparisons. See Collations for instructions on applying collations. \nNOTE When using the options parameter, you must also specify a query parameter. If you don't want to use a query filter, define the query as {}. EXAMPLE \nThe following example uses a collation field to specify German language ordering conventions when outputting the distinct restaurant values: // define an empty query documentconst query = {};// specify German string ordering conventionsconst options = { collation: { locale: \"de\" }};\nconst cursor = myColl.distinct(\"restaurant\", query, options);await cursor.forEach(console.dir);  In this case, German string ordering conventions place words beginning with \"Ä\" before those beginning with \"B\".

Docs Home → Node.js \nSPECIFY WHICH FIELDS TO RETURN \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Sample Documents\n * Single Field\n * Multiple Fields \nOVERVIEW \nUse a projection to control which fields appear in the documents returned by read operations. Many requests only require certain fields, so projections can help you limit unnecessary network bandwidth usage. Projections work in two ways:      * Explicitly include fields with a value of 1. This has the side-effect of implicitly excluding all unspecified fields.  * Implicitly exclude fields with a value of 0. This has the side-effect of implicitly including all unspecified fields. These two methods of projection are mutually exclusive: if you explicitly include fields, you cannot explicitly exclude fields, and vice versa. \nSAMPLE DOCUMENTS \nTo follow along with the examples in this guide, use the following code snippet to insert documents that describe fruits into the myDB.fruits collection: const myDB = client.db(\"myDB\");const myColl = myDB.collection(\"fruits\");\nawait myColl.insertMany([  { \"_id\": 1, \"name\": \"apples\", \"qty\": 5, \"rating\": 3 },  { \"_id\": 2, \"name\": \"bananas\", \"qty\": 7, \"rating\": 1 },  { \"_id\": 3, \"name\": \"oranges\", \"qty\": 6, \"rating\": 2 },  { \"_id\": 4, \"name\": \"avocados\", \"qty\": 3, \"rating\": 5 },]);  \nNOTE Your query operation may return a reference to a cursor that contains matching documents. To learn how to examine data stored in the cursor, see the Cursor Fundamentals page. \nSINGLE FIELD \nIn the following query, pass the projection to only return the name field of each document: // return only* the name fieldconst projection = { name: 1 };const cursor = myColl.find().project(projection);await cursor.forEach(console.dir);  The projection document specifies a value of 1 for name to indicate that the read operation result should include the name field of each returned document. As a result, this projection implicitly excludes the qty and rating fields. Passing this projection to find() with an empty query document and no sort document yields the following results: { \"_id\": 1, \"name\": \"apples\" }{ \"_id\": 2, \"name\": \"bananas\" }{ \"_id\": 3, \"name\": \"oranges\" }{ \"_id\": 4, \"name\": \"avocados\" } Despite the fact that this projection only explicitly included the name field, the query returned the _id field as well! This happens because the _id field is a special case: it is always included in every query unless explicitly specified otherwise. That's because _id is a unique identifier for each document, a property that can be very useful when constructing queries. The movies collection is a good example of why this property is useful: because remakes and even separate works can sometimes reuse movie titles, you need a unique _id value to refer to any specific movie. _id is the only exception to the mutually exclusive include-exclude behavior in projections: you can explicitly exclude _id even when explicitly including other fields if you do not want _id to be present in returned documents. // return only the name fieldconst projection = { _id: 0, name: 1 };const cursor = myColl.find().project(projection);await cursor.forEach(console.dir);  The projection document specifies a value of 1 for name to indicate that the read operation result should include the name field of each returned document. As a result, this projection implicitly excludes the qty and rating fields. Passing this projection to find() with an empty query document and no sort document yields the following results: { \"name\": \"apples\" }{ \"name\": \"bananas\" }{ \"name\": \"oranges\" }{ \"name\": \"avocados\" } \nMULTIPLE FIELDS \nYou can also specify multiple fields to include in your projection. Note: the order in which you specify the fields in the projection does not alter the order in which they are returned. const projection = { _id: 0, rating: 1, name: 1 };const cursor =

Docs Home → Node.js \nCHANGE A DOCUMENT \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Update\n * Replace \nOVERVIEW \nYou can change documents in a MongoDB collection using either update or replace operations. Update operations mutate specified fields in one or more documents and leave other fields and values unchanged. Replace operations remove all existing fields in one or more documents and substitute them with specified fields and values. \nUPDATE \nTo perform an update to one or more documents, create an update document that specifies the update operator (the type of update to perform) and the fields and values that describe the change. Update documents use the following format: {   <update operator>: {      <field> : {         ...      },      <field> : {      }   },   <update operator>: {      ...   }}  The top level of an update document contains one or more of the following update operators:      * $set: replaces the value of a field with a specified one  * $inc: increments or decrements field values  * $rename: renames fields  * $unset: removes fields  * $mul: multiplies a field value by a specified number See the MongoDB Server manual for a complete list of update operators and their usage. The update operators apply only to the fields associated with them in your update document. \nNOTE \nAGGREGATION PIPELINES IN UPDATE OPERATIONS If you are using MongoDB Version 4.2 or later, you can use aggregation pipelines made up of a subset of aggregation stages in update operations. For more information on the aggregation stages MongoDB supports in aggregation pipelines used in update operations, see our tutorial on building updates with aggregation pipelines. \nEXAMPLE \nConsider a document in the myDB.items collection with fields describing an item for sale, its price, and the quantity available: {   _id: 465,   item: \"Hand-thrown ceramic plate\",   price: 32.50,   quantity: 7,}  If you apply the $set update operator with a new value for quantity, you can use the following update document: const myDB = client.db(\"myDB\");const myColl = myDB.collection(\"items\");\nconst filter = { _id: 465 };\n// update the value of the 'quantity' field to 5const updateDocument = {   $set: {      quantity: 5,   },};const result = await myColl.updateOne(filter, updateDocument);  The updated document resembles the following, with an updated value in the quantity field and all other values unchanged: {   _id: 465,   item: \"Hand-thrown ceramic plate\",   price: 32.50,   quantity: 5,} If an update operation fails to match any documents in a collection, it does not make any changes. Update operations can be configured to perform an upsert which attempts to perform an update, but if no documents are matched, inserts a new document with the specified fields and values. You cannot modify the _id field of a document nor change a field to a value that violates a unique index constraint. See the MongoDB Server manual for more information on unique indexes. \nREPLACE \nTo perform a replacement operation, create a replacement document that consists of the fields and values that you would like to use in your replace operation. Replacement documents use the following format: {   <field>: {      <value>   },   <field>: {      ...   }}  Replacement documents are the documents that you want to take the place of existing documents that match the query filters. \nEXAMPLE \nConsider a document in the myDB.items collection with fields describing an item for sale, its price, and the quantity available: {   _id: 501,   item: \"3-wick beeswax candle\",   price: 18.99,   quantity: 10,}  Suppose you wanted to replace this document with one that contains a description for an entirely different item. Your replacement operation might resemble the following: const myDB = client.db(\"myDB\");const myColl = myDB.collection(\"items\");\nconst filter = { _id: 501 };\n// replace the matched document with

Elements\n * Matching Multiple Array Elements \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use the following array update operators to modify an array embedded within a document:      * Positional Operator: $  * All Positional Operator: $[]  * Filtered Positional Operator: $[<identifier>] See the MongoDB server guide on Update Operators for a complete list. \nSAMPLE DOCUMENTS \nThe examples in this guide use the following sample documents from the test.pizza collection. The collection contains documents that describe the customers and their pizza orders as array elements in field called items. [{   name: \"Steve Lobsters\",   address: \"731 Yexington Avenue\",   items: [     { type: \"beverage\", name: \"Water\", size: \"17oz\", },     { type: \"pizza\", size: \"large\", toppings: [\"pepperoni\"], },     { type: \"pizza\", size: \"medium\", toppings: [\"mushrooms\", \"sausage\", \"green peppers\"], comment: \"Extra green peppers please!\", },     { type: \"pizza\", size: \"large\", toppings: [\"pineapple, ham\"], comment: \"red pepper flakes on top\", },     { type: \"calzone\", fillings: [\"canadian bacon\", \"sausage\", \"onion\"], },     { type: \"beverage\", name: \"Diet Pepsi\", size: \"16oz\", },   ], }, {   name: \"Popeye\",   address: \"1 Sweethaven\",   items: [     { type: \"pizza\", size: \"large\", toppings: [\"garlic, spinach\"], },     { type: \"calzone\", toppings: [\"ham\"], },   ], }]  \nSPECIFYING ARRAY ELEMENTS \nYou can specify which array elements to update using a positional operator. Positional operators can specify the first, all, or certain array elements to update. To specify elements in an array with positional operators, use dot notation. Dot notation is a property access syntax for navigating BSON objects.

The positional operator $ references the array matched by the query. You cannot use this operator to reference a nested array. For cases in which you want to access a nested array, use the filtered positional operator. \nIMPORTANT Do not use the $ operator in an upsert call because the driver treats $ as a field name in the insert document. EXAMPLE \nThe following code snippet shows how to update the size of the first pizza order item to \"extra large\" for the customer named Steve Lobsters.     const query = { name: \"Steve Lobsters\", \"items.type\": \"pizza\" };    const updateDocument = {      $set: { \"items.$.size\": \"extra large\" }    };    const result = await pizza.updateOne(query, updateDocument);  The query matches all documents that contain an element embedded in the items array that contain a value of pizza in the type field. The updateDocument specifies the update operation to set the first array element match in items to \"extra large\". After you run the update method, your customer document for Steve Lobsters resembles the following: {  name: \"Steve Lobsters\",  address: \"731 Yexington Avenue\",  items: [    { type: \"pizza\", size: \"extra large\", ... },    ...  ]}  Note that we included both name and items.type fields in the query in order to match the array in which we apply the $ operator. If we omit the items.type field from the query and specify the $ operator in our update, we encounter the following error: The positional operator did not find the match needed from the query. \nMATCHING ALL ARRAY ELEMENTS \nTo perform the update on all of the array elements of each document that matches your query, use the all positional operator $[].

 After you run the update method, your customer document for Popeye resembles the following: {  name:\"Popeye\",  address: \"1 Sweethaven\",  items: [    { type: \"pizza\", ... , toppings: [\"garlic\", \"spinach\", \"fresh mozzarella\"], },    { type: \"calzone\", ... , toppings: [\"ham\", \"fresh mozzarella\"], },  ]} \nMATCHING MULTIPLE ARRAY ELEMENTS \nTo perform an update on all embedded array elements of each document that matches your query, use the filtered positional operator $[<identifier>]. The filtered positional operator $[<identifier>] specifies the matching array elements in the update document. To identify which array elements to match, pair this operator with <identifier> in an options.arrayFilters object. The <identifier> term is a placeholder value you assign that represents an element of the array field name that prefixes it. This value must start with a lowercase letter and contain only alphanumeric characters. EXAMPLE \nTo add a \"garlic\" topping to certain order items, format your update document as follows: { $push: { items.$[orderItem].toppings: \"garlic\" } }  This update document specifies the following:  * $push: the update operator  * items: the array in the document to update  * orderItem: the identifier for the filtered positional operator  * toppings: the field on the items array element to update  * garlic: the value to push onto the toppings array Next, add the matching criteria in your arrayFilters object in your update operation's options parameter. This object is an array of queries that specify which array elements to include in the update. To add the \"garlic\" topping to order items of type \"pizza\" and \"large size\", pass the following arrayFilters: arrayFilters: [  { orderItem.type: \"pizza\" },  { orderItem.size: \"large\" }]  The following snippet shows the complete update method:     const query = { name: \"Steve Lobsters\" };    const updateDocument = {      $push: { \"items.$[orderItem].toppings\": \"garlic\" }    };    const options = {      arrayFilters: [{        \"orderItem.type\": \"pizza\",        \"orderItem.size\": \"large\",      }]    };\n    const result = await pizza.updateMany(query, updateDocument, options);  After you run the method, your customer document for Steve Lobsters resembles the following: {  name: \"Steve Lobsters\",  address: \"731 Yexington Avenue\",  items: [    { type: \"pizza\", size: \"large\", toppings: [\"pepperoni\", \"garlic\"] },    { type: \"pizza\", size: \"large\", toppings: [\"pineapple\", \"ham\", \"garlic\"], ...},    ...  ]} EXAMPLE \nSuppose Steve Lobsters wants to adjust their order to add \"salami\" as a topping to all pizzas that have pepperoni. To perform the update, use the filtered positional operator as follows:     const query = { name: \"Steve Lobsters\" };    const updateDocument = {      $push: { \"items.$[item].toppings\": \"salami\" },    };    const options = {      arrayFilters: [        {          \"item.type\": \"pizza\",          \"item.toppings\": \"pepperoni\",        },      ],    };    const result = await

Docs Home → Node.js \nINSERT A DOCUMENT \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * A Note About _id\n * Insert a Single Document\n * Insert Multiple Documents \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to insert documents into MongoDB. You can use MongoDB to retrieve, update and delete information. To perform any of those operations, that information, such as user profiles and orders, needs to exist in MongoDB. For that information to exist, you need to first perform an insert operation. An insert operation inserts a single or multiple documents in MongoDB using the insertOne(), insertMany() and bulkWrite() methods. The following sections focus on insertOne() and insertMany(). For an example on how to use the bulkWrite() method, see our runnable Bulk Operations Example. \nA NOTE ABOUT _ID \nWhen inserting a document, MongoDB enforces one constraint on your documents by default. Each document must contain a unique _id field. There are two ways to manage this field:      * You can manage this field yourself, ensuring each value you use is unique.  * You can let the driver automatically generate unique ObjectId values with the primary key factory. Unless you have provided strong guarantees for uniqueness, we recommend you let the driver automatically generate _id values. \nNOTE Duplicate _id values violate unique index constraints, resulting in a WriteError. For additional information about _id, see the Server Manual Entry on Unique Indexes. \nINSERT A SINGLE DOCUMENT \nUse the insertOne() method when you want to insert a single document. On successful insertion, the method returns an InsertOneResult instance representing the _id of the new document. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example uses the insertOne() method to insert a new document into the myDB.pizzaMenu collection: const myDB = client.db(\"myDB\");const myColl = myDB.collection(\"pizzaMenu\");\nconst doc = { name: \"Neapolitan pizza\", shape: \"round\" };const result = await myColl.insertOne(doc);console.log(   `A document was inserted with the _id: ${result.insertedId}`,);  Your output should look something like this: A document was inserted with the _id: 60c79c0f4cc72b6bb31e3836 For additional information on the classes and methods mentioned in this section, see the following resources:  * API Documentation on insertOne()  * API Documentation on InsertOneResult  * Server Manual Entry on insertOne()  * Runnable Insert a Document Example \nINSERT MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS \nUse the insertMany() method when you want to insert multiple documents. This method inserts documents in the order specified until an exception occurs, if any. For example, assume you want to insert the following documents: { \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"red\" }{ \"_id\": 2, \"color\": \"purple\" }{ \"_id\": 1, \"color\": \"yellow\" }{ \"_id\": 3, \"color\": \"blue\" } If you attempt to insert these documents, a WriteError occurs at the third document and the documents prior to the error get inserted into your collection. \nNOTE Use a try-catch block to
