For a detailed description of this method's parameters, see insertOne() in the MongoDB Manual. To run your Playground, press the Play Button at the top right of the Playground View. MongoDB for VS Code splits your Playground and outputs the results of your Playground in the Playground Results.json pane. If you disabled split-view, MongoDB for VS Code outputs the results of your Playground in a new tab. \nEXAMPLE \nTo run this example, start with a blank MongoDB Playground by clearing the template Playground if it is loaded. The following example:  1. Switches to the test database.  2. Inserts eight documents into the test.sales collection. use(\"test\");\ndb.sales.insertOne(  { \"_id\" : 1, \"item\" : \"abc\", \"price\" : 10, \"quantity\" : 2, \"date\" : new Date(\"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z\")}); When you press the Play Button, MongoDB for VS Code splits your Playground and outputs the following document in the Playground Results.json pane. If you disabled split-view, MongoDB for VS Code outputs the following document in a new tab. If you manually move your playground results, MongoDB for VS Code displays the results in that tab. {  acknowleged: 1,  insertedId: 1}  \nCREATE MANY DOCUMENTS \nTo create many documents, use the following syntax in your Playground: db.collection.insertMany(   [ <document 1> , <document 2>, ... ],   {      writeConcern: <document>,      ordered: <boolean>   })  \nNOTE If the database doesn't exist, insert operations will create it.

Docs Home â†’ MongoDB for VS Code \nCONNECT TO YOUR MONGODB DEPLOYMENT \nOn this page    \n * Considerations\n   \n * Create a Connection to a Deployment\n * Activate a Connection\n * Rename a Connection\n * Disconnect from a Deployment\n * Remove a Connection \nNOTE \nPREVIEW MongoDB for VS Code is currently available as a Preview in the Visual Studio Marketplace. The product, its features, and the corresponding documentation may change during the Preview stage. This page outlines how to use MongoDB for VS Code to connect to a MongoDB host. You can connect to a standalone, replica set, or sharded cluster host. \nNOTE \nMONGODB ATLAS If you need to create a MongoDB host, consider using MongoDB Atlas. Atlas is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service which requires no installation, offers a free tier to get started, and provides a copyable URI to easily connect MongoDB for VS Code to your deployment. To create a cluster on the Atlas free tier, run the command MongoDB: Open Overview Page in the Visual Studio Code Command Palette and then click Create free cluster. To create an Atlas cluster using a Terraform template included with MongoDB for VS Code, see Create an Atlas Cluster from a Template using Terraform. If you need to install MongoDB for VS Code, see Install MongoDB for VS Code for instructions. \nCONSIDERATIONS \n     * When connecting MongoDB for VS Code to a replica set, use either the replica set SRV record or Replica Set Name when filling in your connection information. It is not recommended to connect directly to an individual replica set member.\n   \n   * If the member to which you are connected switches from a primary member to a secondary or vice versa as the result of an election, MongoDB for VS Code may either forcibly close the connection or display stale data.  * You can't connect MongoDB for VS Code directly to an analytics node.  * MongoDB for VS Code appends the appName connection string option with a value of mongodb-vscode <version> for all deployment connections. \nCREATE A CONNECTION TO A DEPLOYMENT \nMongoDB for VS Code provides two methods to create a connection to a deployment. You can:  * Provide a deployment connection string, or  * Fill in a deployment information in specific fields. Providing a connection string is faster and easier than filling in a deployment's details. Use this option if Atlas hosts your deployment or if you have a connection string for a deployment available. Define how your connection is saved with the Default Connection Saving Location setting: Setting\nDescription\nGlobal\nSave your connection globally in VS Code, so it can be accessed from any workspace.\nWorkspace\nSave your connection in your workspace. You cannot access the connection from a different workspace.\nSession\nSave the connection for only this VS Code session. The connection is lost when you close VS Code.

Docs Home â†’ MongoDB for VS Code \nREAD DOCUMENTS \nOn this page    \n * Prerequisites\n   \n * Read One Document\n * Read Many Documents You can read documents in a collection using the MongoDB CRUD Operators in a MongoDB Playground:      * Use the findOne() method to read one document.  * Use the find() method to read more than one document. \nNOTE You can open a JavaScript Playground pre-configured to search a collection by hovering over the Documents label in the navigation panel and clicking the icon that appears. \nPREREQUISITES \nIf you have not done so already, you must complete the following prerequisites before you can read documents with a MongoDB Playground:  * Create a connection to a MongoDB deployment.  * Activate the connection to the MongoDB deployment.  * Open a MongoDB Playground.  * Create Documents or create documents in a collection using a different method. \nREAD ONE DOCUMENT \nTo read one document, use the following syntax in your Playground: db.collection.findOne(   { <query> },   { <projection> })  If multiple documents satisfy the query, this method returns the first document according to the natural order which reflects the order of documents on the disk. To learn more about this method's parameters, see findOne() in the MongoDB Manual. To run your Playground, press the Play Button at the top right of the Playground View. MongoDB for VS Code splits your Playground and outputs the results of your Playground in the Playground Results.json pane. If you disabled split-view, MongoDB for VS Code outputs the results of your Playground in a new tab. You may edit any JSON document returned from a findOne() or find() operation.  1. At the top of this document, click Edit Document. MongoDB for VS Code opens it as an editable EJSON document titled <database>.<collection>:\"<_id>\".json.  2. Make any edits you require.  3. Press Ctrl + S (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + S to save the edited document to the MongoDB database.\n    \n    * If the update succeeds, MongoDB for VS Code confirms that the database has stored the change.\n    \n    * If the update results in an error, MongoDB for VS Code displays it. \nEXAMPLE \nTo run this example, start with a blank MongoDB Playground by clearing the template Playground if it is loaded. The following example:  1. Switches to the test database.  2. Reads one document in the test.sales collection that matches the query. use(\"test\");\ndb.sales.findOne(  { \"_id\" : 1 },  { \"_id\" : 0 }); When you press the Play Button, MongoDB for VS Code splits your Playground and outputs the following document in the Playground Results.json pane. If you disabled split-view, MongoDB for VS Code outputs the following document in a new tab. If you manually move your playground results, MongoDB for VS Code displays the results in that tab. {  item: 'abc',  price: 10,  quantity: 2,  date: 2014-03-01T08:00:00.000Z}  \nREAD MANY DOCUMENTS \nTo read many documents, use the following syntax in your Playground: db.collection.find(   { <query> },   { <projection> })  For a detailed description of this method's parameters, see find() in the MongoDB Manual. To run your Playground, press the Play Button at the top right of the Playground View. MongoDB for VS Code splits your Playground and outputs the results of your Playground in the Playground Results.json pane. If you disabled split-view, MongoDB for VS Code outputs the results of your Playground in a new tab. \nEXAMPLE \nTo run this example, start with a blank MongoDB Playground by clearing the template Playground if it is loaded.

Docs Home â†’ MongoDB for VS Code \nCREATE AN ATLAS CLUSTER FROM A TEMPLATE USING TERRAFORM \nOn this page    \n * Prerequisites\n   \n * Procedures \nNOTE \nPREVIEW MongoDB for VS Code is currently available as a Preview in the Visual Studio Marketplace. The product, its features, and the corresponding documentation may change during the Preview stage. This page outlines how to use the Atlas template for Terraform files included with the MongoDB Extension for Visual Studio Code to create Shared Tier Atlas clusters. After loading the template, you configure the cluster and provide details about your Atlas account. You then use Terraform commands to plan, apply, and destroy your Atlas cluster. \nPREREQUISITES \nBefore you use the Atlas template for Terraform files included with the MongoDB Extension for Visual Studio Code, you must:      * Install MongoDB for VS Code  * Install Terraform  * Have an Atlas account.  * Have an Atlas organization.  * Have an API key in an organization with the Organization Owner or Organization Project Creator role. \nPROCEDURES  CREATE AN ATLAS TERRAFORM FILE USING THE TEMPLATE \nUse the Atlas template for Terraform files included with the MongoDB for VS Code to configure an Atlas cluster: 1 IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE, CREATE A NEW FILE. \nOperating System\nMethod\nActions\nAny\nVisual Studio Code Menu\nFile > New File\nMacOS\nKeyboard Shortcut\nPress Command + N\nWindows and Linux\nKeyboard Shortcut\nPress Control + N 2 SAVE THE FILE. NAME IT MAIN.TF.  NOTE main.tf is the recommended filename for the entry point to a Terraform module. 3 IN THE MAIN.TF FILE, TYPE ATLAS, THEN PRESS THE ENTER OR RETURN KEY. \nThe MongoDB Extension for VSCode populates the file with an example configuration using the MongoDB Atlas Terraform provider to create a Shared Tier Atlas cluster. 4 UPDATE THE ATLAS TERRAFORM CONFIGURATION TO CONFIGURE YOUR CLUSTER. \nThe cursor moves to select the value of the name argument of the mongodbatlas_project resource.

Define the local variables in an input variables file.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    variable \"mongodb_atlas_api_pub_key\" {  default = \"my-public-key\"}\n    variable \"mongodb_atlas_api_pri_key\" {  default = \"my-private-key\"}\n    \n      b. Exclude the input variables file from your repository. For example, add the filename to the .gitignore file for your repository.  c. Reference variables from the input variables file in the main.tf file by prefacing them with vars..\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    provider \"mongodbatlas\" {  public_key  = vars.mongodb_atlas_api_pub_key  private_key = vars.mongodb_atlas_api_pri_key}\n    \n     6 ADD OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS TO THE MAIN.TF FILE. \nFor a complete list of supported configuration options, see the MongoDB Atlas Terraform Provider documentation. \nNOTE Shared Tier Atlas clusters don't support all configurations available with the MongoDB Atlas Terraform provider.

Docs Home â†’ MongoDB for VS Code \nRUN AGGREGATION PIPELINES \nOn this page    \n * Open a Playground to Run Aggregation Pipelines\n   \n * Open the Visual Studio Code Command Palette.\n * Find and run the \"Create MongoDB Playground\" command.\n * Create and Run an Aggregation Pipeline\n * Example \nNOTE \nPREVIEW MongoDB for VS Code is currently available as a Preview in the Visual Studio Marketplace. The product, its features, and the corresponding documentation may change during the Preview stage. You can run aggregation pipelines on your collections in MongoDB for VS Code. Aggregation pipelines consist of stages that process your data and return computed results. Common uses for aggregation include:      * Grouping data by a given expression.  * Calculating results based on multiple fields and storing those results in a new field.  * Filtering data to return a subset that matches a given criteria.  * Sorting data. When you run an aggregation, MongoDB for VS Code conveniently outputs the results directly within Visual Studio Code. \nOPEN A PLAYGROUND TO RUN AGGREGATION PIPELINES \nYou can run aggregation pipelines in a MongoDB Playground. MongoDB Playgrounds are JavaScript environments where you can prototype queries, aggregations, and MongoDB commands with helpful syntax highlighting. To open a new MongoDB Playground: 1 \nOPEN THE VISUAL STUDIO CODE COMMAND PALETTE. \nIn Visual Studio Code, press one of the following key combinations:  * Control + Shift + P on Windows or Linux.  * Command + Shift + P on macOS. The Command Palette provides quick access to commands and keyboard shortcuts. 2 \nFIND AND RUN THE \"CREATE MONGODB PLAYGROUND\" COMMAND. \nUse the Command Palette search bar to search for commands. All commands related to MongoDB for VS Code are prefaced with MongoDB:. When you run the MongoDB: Create MongoDB Playground command, MongoDB for VS Code opens a default playground template pre-configured with a few commands. \nNOTE To load new Playgrounds without the template, disable the Use Default Template For Playground setting. To learn more about MongoDB for VS Code settings, see MongoDB for VS Code Settings. \nCREATE AND RUN AN AGGREGATION PIPELINE \nTo create an aggregation pipeline, use the following syntax in your Playground: db.<collection>.aggregate([  {    <$stage1>  },  {    <$stage2>  }  ...])  To run your Playground, press the Play Button at the top right of the Playground View.

Docs Home â†’ MongoDB for VS Code \nNAVIGATE YOUR DATA \nOn this page    \n * View Databases and Collections\n   \n * View Collection Documents and Schema\n * Manage Indexes\n * Create a New Database\n * Create a New Collection\n * Drop a Database or Collection\n * Refresh Data \nNOTE \nPREVIEW MongoDB for VS Code is currently available as a Preview in the Visual Studio Marketplace. The product, its features, and the corresponding documentation may change during the Preview stage. Once you connect to your deployment using MongoDB for VS Code, use the left navigation to:      * Explore your databases, collections, read-only views, and documents.  * Create new databases and collections.  * Drop databases and collections.  \nNOTE If your deployment requires authentication, your database user privileges may affect the actions you can perform using MongoDB for VS Code. \nVIEW DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS \nWhen you expand an active connection, MongoDB for VS Code shows the databases in that deployment.  * Click the name of a database to view the collections it contains.  * Click the name of a collection to view its documents, schema, and indexes. \nNOTE MongoDB for VS Code closes all documents when you close Visual Studio Code. \nVIEW COLLECTION DOCUMENTS AND SCHEMA \nWhen you expand a collection, MongoDB for VS Code displays the number of documents next to the Documents label in the navigation panel. DOCUMENTS \nWhen you expand a collection's documents, MongoDB for VS Code lists the _id of each document in the collection. Click an _id value to open that document in Visual Studio Code and view its contents. You may edit this single document:  1. At the top of this document, click Edit Document. MongoDB for VS Code opens it as an editable EJSON document titled <database>.<collection>:\"<_id>\".json.  2. Make any edits you require.  3. Press Ctrl + S (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + S to save the edited document to the MongoDB database.\n    \n    * If the update succeeds, MongoDB for VS Code confirms that the database has stored the change.\n    \n    * If the update results in an error, MongoDB for VS Code displays it. \nIMPORTANT Users must have the listCollections permission in order to view a collection's documents. To view all of the collection's documents in an array, you can:  1. Right-click a collection.  2. Click View Documents. \nNOTE You can open a JavaScript Playground pre-configured to search a collection by hovering over the Documents label in the navigation panel and clicking the icon that appears. SCHEMA \nYour collection's schema defines the fields and data types within the collection. Due to MongoDB's flexible schema model, different documents in a collection may contain different fields, and data types may vary within a field. MongoDB can enforce schema validation to ensure your collection documents have the same shape. When you expand a collection's schema, MongoDB for VS Code lists the fields which appear in that collection's documents. If a field exists in all documents and its type is consistent throughout the collection, MongoDB for VS Code displays an icon indicating that field's data type. Hover over the field name for a text description of the field's data type. \nMANAGE INDEXES \nYour collections's indexes are listed under the Indexes heading. When you expand an index, each index key appears with an icon designating its type. Index key types include:  * Ascending  * Descending  * Geospatial (2d, 2dsphere, geoHaystack)  * Text  * Hashed \nNOTE You can open a MongoDB Playground pre-configured to create an index by hovering over the Indexes label in the navigation panel and clicking the icon that appears. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: To learn more about MongoDB indexes, see the server manual. \nCREATE A NEW DATABASE \nWhen you create a new database, you must populate it with an initial collection. To create a new database:  1. Hover over the connection for the deployment where you want your database to exist.  2. Click the icon that appears.  3. In the prompt, enter a name for your new database.  4. Press the enter key.  5. Enter a name for the first collection in your new database.  6. Press the enter key. \nCREATE A NEW COLLECTION \nTo create a new collection:  1. Hover over the database where you want your collection to exist.  2. Click the Plus icon that appears.  3. In the prompt, enter a name for your new collection.  4.

Docs Home â†’ MongoDB for VS Code \nEXPORT A QUERY OR PIPELINE TO LANGUAGE \nOn this page    \n * Prerequisites\n   \n * Export a Query Document\n * Export an Aggregation Pipeline You can export and translate query documents and aggregation pipelines from a playground into a programming language. You can export queries and pipelines to the following languages:      * C#  * Java  * Node.js  * Python  * Ruby \nPREREQUISITES \nYou must open a playground that contains a query document or pipeline you want to export. The tutorials on this page use the default playground template. To open a new playground containing the default template: 1 \nOPEN THE VISUAL STUDIO CODE COMMAND PALETTE. \nIn Visual Studio Code, press one of the following key combinations:  * Control + Shift + P on Windows or Linux.  * Command + Shift + P on macOS. The Command Palette provides quick access to commands and keyboard shortcuts. 2 \nFIND AND RUN THE \"CREATE MONGODB PLAYGROUND\" COMMAND. \nUse the Command Palette search bar to search for commands. All commands related to MongoDB for VS Code are prefaced with MongoDB:. When you run the MongoDB: Create MongoDB Playground command, MongoDB for VS Code opens a default playground template pre-configured with a few commands. \nNOTE To load new Playgrounds without the template, disable the Use Default Template For Playground setting. To learn more about MongoDB for VS Code settings, see MongoDB for VS Code Settings. \nEXPORT A QUERY DOCUMENT \nTo export a query document: 1 \nHIGHLIGHT THE CODE YOU WANT TO EXPORT. \nHighlight the query document from the playground template: { date: { $gte: new Date('2014-04-04'), $lt: new Date('2014-04-05') } } \n2 \nEXPORT YOUR SELECTION. \n a. When you highlighted your code, a light bulb icon appeared. Click the icon.  b. In the context menu, choose the language you want to export to. MongoDB for VS Code opens a new VS Code window containing the highlighted code in your chosen language. For example, exporting the query document from Step 1 to Java results in the following code: new Document(\"date\", new Document(\"$gte\", new java.util.Date(1396569600000L))        .append(\"$lt\", new java.util.Date(1396656000000L))) \n3 \nCONFIGURE EXPORT OPTIONS \nYou can choose whether to include import statements, driver syntax, or both in your exported code. At the top of the newly opened VS Code window containing your exported code, use the Import Statements and Driver Syntax toggles to control these options. Including both import statements and driver syntax for the preceding Java code results in this output: import org.bson.Document;import com.mongodb.MongoClient;import com.mongodb.MongoClientURI;import com.mongodb.client.FindIterable;import com.mongodb.client.MongoCollection;import com.mongodb.client.MongoDatabase;import org.bson.conversions.Bson;import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;import

Docs Home â†’ MongoDB for VS Code \nEXPLORE YOUR DATA WITH PLAYGROUNDS \nOn this page    \n * Prerequisite\n   \n * Open a Playground\n * Run a Playground\n * Log to Console from a Playground\n * Tutorials\n * Consideration for Authentication \nNOTE \nPREVIEW MongoDB for VS Code is currently available as a Preview in the Visual Studio Marketplace. The product, its features, and the corresponding documentation may change during the Preview stage. MongoDB Playgrounds are JavaScript environments where you can prototype queries, aggregations, and MongoDB commands with helpful syntax highlighting. MongoDB Playgrounds provide intelligent autocomplete for:      * The Mongo Shell API,  * MongoDB operators,  * Database, collection, and field names. You can save playgrounds in your workspace and use them to document how your application interacts with MongoDB. MongoDB for VS Code interprets files with the .mongodb extension as playgrounds. \nNOTE You can also use your application to perform CRUD operations on documents using the appropriate driver. Playgrounds are meant to help you prototype database operations as you develop your application. MongoDB for VS Code splits your Playground window to display your Playground Result in the right-side pane. You can perform one of two actions on the result depending on the query you ran in the Playground.  * You may save any Playground Result to a file.  * You may edit any JSON document that MongoDB for VS Code returns in the Playground Result from a findOne or find query.\n   \n   MongoDB for VS Code returns these results in JSON format with JSON syntax highlighting. Each JSON document has an Edit Document link at its top.\n   \n   1. Click Edit Document at the top of the document you want to edit.\n      \n      MongoDB for VS Code opens this one JSON document in a new window as an editable document.\n   \n   2. Make any changes you need.\n   \n   3. Press Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on macOS) to save those changes in the database. \nPREREQUISITE \nTo run a playground, you must connect to a MongoDB deployment using MongoDB for VS Code. To learn how to connect to a deployment, see either:  * Connect to Your MongoDB Deployment  * Connect to a Deployment from a Playground \nOPEN A PLAYGROUND  CREATE A NEW PLAYGROUND \nYou can create a new playground from the Playgrounds panel, the MongoDB for VS Code Overview page, or the Microsoft Visual Studio Code Command Pallette.   OPEN A SAVED PLAYGROUND \nIf you have files in your Visual Studio Code workspace with the .mongodb extension, MongoDB for VS Code displays these files in the Playgrounds panel. Double click a .mongodb file to open that playground. \nRUN A PLAYGROUND \nTo run a playground, click the Play Button in VS Code's top navigation bar. Your playground runs against the deployment specified in your active connection. \nCONNECT TO A DEPLOYMENT FROM A PLAYGROUND \nIf MongoDB for VS Code is not connected to a MongoDB deployment, you can specify a connection string for the deployment you want to run your playground against. If you have a playground file open in Visual Studio Code and do not have an active connection, MongoDB for VS Code displays Click here to add connection at the top of your playground.   1. Click this link to open the connection string dialog.  2. Enter the connection string for the deployment you want to run this playground against.  3. Press Enter.  4. Run your playground. \nNOTE When you connect to a deployment through the playground connection dialog, that connection is added to your MongoDB for VS Code Connections list. \nRUN SELECTED LINES OF A PLAYGROUND \nIf you select a section of your playground, you may optionally run only the selected portion. You may run either a single line or multiple lines of your playground. MongoDB for VS Code shows the Run Selected Lines from Playground link immediately above your selected section. Click this link to test and troubleshoot specific lines or sections of your playground. \nLOG TO CONSOLE FROM A PLAYGROUND \nMongoDB for VS Code supports the following methods to log messages to the console. Logged messages appear in the Output panel in VSCode.  * console.log()  * print()  * printjson() Logging to the console can be useful to track the output of certain commands in your playground, such
