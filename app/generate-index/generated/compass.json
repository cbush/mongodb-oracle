Schema validation ensures that all documents in a collection follow a defined set of rules, such as conforming to a specific shape or only allowing a specified range of values in fields.  \nVALIDATION RULES \nUpdated in version 1.18. The validation editor supports JSON Schema validation, and validation with query expressions using query operators. As you edit your validation, Compass updates in real-time to display a document from your collection that passes the validation and a document that fails. \nJSON SCHEMA VALIDATION \nTo specify JSON Schema validation, use the $jsonSchema operator. {   $jsonSchema: {      required: ['customer'], // the customer field is required      properties: {      purchaseMethod: {         enum: ['In Store','Online'],         description: \"can only be either 'In Store' or 'Online'\"      }      }   }}  The $jsonSchema operator supports various keywords to specify validation rules. For example:      * The required array defines required fields in your document.  * The properties object defines rules for specific documentfields. Consider the following example validation: {   $jsonSchema: {      bsonType: \"object\",      required: [ \"name\", \"year\", \"major\", \"gpa\", \"address.city\", \"address.street\" ],      properties: {         name: {            bsonType: \"string\",            description: \"must be a string\"         },         year: {            bsonType: \"int\",            minimum: 2017,            maximum: 3017,            exclusiveMaximum: false,            description: \"must be an integer in [ 2017, 3017 ]\"         },         major: {            bsonType: \"string\",            enum: [ \"Math\", \"English\", \"Computer Science\", \"History\", null ],            description: \"can only be one of the enum values\"         },         gpa: {            bsonType: [ \"double\" ],            minimum: 0,            description: \"must be a double\"         }      }   }}  This validation specifies:  * The list of required fields.  * The bsonType for all fields.  * The minimum and maximum values for the year field.  * The acceptable values for the major field, using enum.  * The minimum value for the gpa field. For all available $jsonSchema keywords, refer to the $jsonSchema page in the MongoDB manual. \nVALIDATION USING QUERY OPERATORS \nYou can also specify validation using query operators, with the exception of the following query operators: $near, $nearSphere, $text, and $where. {   $or: [      { phone: { $type: \"string\" } },      { email: { $regex: /@mongodb\\.com$/ } },      { status: { $in: [ \"Unknown\", \"Incomplete\" ] } }   ]}  Using this validation, one of the following must be true:  * The phone field must be BSON type string,  * The email field must match the regex

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nMANAGE INDEXES \nOn this page    \n * Indexes Tab\n   \n * Create an Index\n * Drop an Index\n * Limitations Indexes are special data structures that improve query performance. Indexes store a portion of a collection's data in an easy-to-traverse form. The index stores the value of a specific field or set of fields, ordered by the value of the field. To improve query performance, build indexes on fields that appear often in queries and for all operations that sort by a field.      * Queries on an indexed field can use the index to limit the number of documents that must be scanned to find matching documents.  * Sort operations on an indexed field can return documents pre-sorted by the index. To learn more about indexes, see Indexes. \nNOTE \nCONSIDERATIONS Indexes have some negative performance impact on write operations. For collections with high write-to-read ratio, indexes are expensive since each insert must also update any indexes. For a detailed list of considerations for indexes, see Operational Considerations for Indexes. \nINDEXES TAB \nThe Indexes tab lists the existing indexes for a collection. To access the Indexes tab for a collection, click on the collection on the left hand pane and select the Indexes tab.  For each index, Compass displays the following information: Name and Definition\nThe name of the index and keys.\nType\nRegular, text, geospatial or hashed index.\nSize\nHow large the index is.\nUsage\nNumber of times the index has been used since the time the index was created or the last server restart.\nProperties\nAny special properties (such as uniqueness, partial) of the index. \nCREATE AN INDEX \nTo create an index on a collection via Compass, the collection must contain documents. 1 \nCLICK THE CREATE INDEX BUTTON. \nFrom the Indexes tab, click the Create Index button to bring up the Create Index dialog. 2 \nOPTIONAL. ENTER THE INDEX NAME. \nIn the dialog, enter the name of the index to create, or leave blank to have MongoDB create a default name for the index. 3 \nADD FIELDS TO INDEX. \n a. Specify an index key.\n    \n    * To specify an existing document field as an index key, select the field from the dropdown list.\n    \n    * To specify a field which does not exist in any document as an index key, enter the field name in the input box.\n    \n    * To create a compound index, click Add Another Field.  b. Use the dropdown to the right of each field name to specify the index type (ascending, descending, or 2dsphere). \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: To learn how to specify a wildcard index, see Wildcard Indexes. 4 \nOPTIONAL. SPECIFY THE INDEX OPTIONS. \nCompass supports the following index options: Option\nDescription\nMore Information\nBuild index in the background\nEnsure that the MongoDB deployment remains available duringthe index build operation.\nBackground Construction\nCreate unique index\nEnsure that the indexed fields do not store duplicate values.\nUnique Indexes\nCreate a TTL index\nDelete documents automatically after a specified number of seconds since the indexed field value.\nTTL Indexes\nPartial filter expression Index only the documents which match the specified filter expression. \nEXAMPLE The following partial filter expression only indexes documents where the timezone field exists: { \"timezone\": { \"$exists\": true } } \nPartial Indexes\nUse custom collation\nCreate a custom collation for the index using the options provided in Compass.\nCollation Document\nWildcard projection (New in MongoDB 4.2) Support unknown or arbitrary fields which match the specified projection in the index. To use a wildcard projection, set your index field name to $**. This directs Compass to use all fields in the document (excluding _id). \nEXAMPLE Consider the following wildcard projection document: {  \"product_attributes.elements\" : 1,  \"product_attributes.resistance\" : 1}  If your index field name is $**, your index only includes the values of the fields in that projection. Wildcard Indexes 5 \nCLICK CREATE INDEX.  WILDCARD INDEXES \nNew in version v4.2. You can create wildcard indexes to support queries against unknown or arbitrary fields.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nANALYZE YOUR DATA SCHEMA \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Query Bar\n * Field Descriptions\n * Query Builder\n * Analyze Location Data\n * Troubleshooting \nOVERVIEW \nThe Schema tab provides an overview of the data type and shape of the fields in a particular collection. Databases and collections are visible in the left-side navigation. The overview is based on sampling the documents in the collection. The schema overview may include additional data about the contents of the fields, such as the minimum and maximum values of dates and integers, the frequency of occurrence of particular values, and the cardinality of the data. MongoDB has a flexible schema model, which means that some fields may contain different types of data from one document to the next. For example, a field named address may contain strings and integers in some documents, objects in others, or some combination of all three. In the case of heterogenous fields, the Schema tab shows a breakdown of the various data types contained within the field with the percentage of each data type represented. \nEXAMPLE The Schema tab shows size information about the test.restaurants collection at the top, including the total number of documents in the collection, the average document size, and the total disk space occupied by the collection. The following fields are shown with details:      * The _id field is an ObjectId. Each ObjectId contains a timestamp, so Compass displays the range of creation times for the sampled documents.  * The address field contains four nested fields. You can expand the field panel to see analyses of each of the nested fields.  * The borough field contains a string indicating the borough in which the restaurant is located. The cardinality is low enough that Compass can provide a graded bar of the field contents, with the most-frequently occurring string on the left.  * The categories field contains arrays of strings. The analysis shows the minimum, maximum, and average array lengths.  \nQUERY BAR \nUsing the query bar in the Schema tab, you can create a query filter to limit your result set. Click the Options button to specify query options, such as the particular fields to display and the number of results to return.  \nTIP In the Schema tab, you can also use the Query Builder to enter a query into the query bar. \nFIELD DESCRIPTIONS \nFor each field, Compass displays summary information about the data type or types the field contains and the range of values. Depending on the data type and the level of cardinality, Compass displays histograms, graded bars, geographical maps, and sample data to provide a sense of the shape and scope of the data contained in each field. \nFIELD WITH A SINGLE DATA TYPE \nBelow is an example of the data type summary for a field called last_login which contains data of type date.  \nFIELD WITH MULTIPLE DATA TYPES \nFor fields that contain multiple data types, Compass displays a percentage breakdown of the various data types across documents. In the example below, the chart shows the contents of a field called phone_no in which 81% of documents are of type string, and the remaining 19% are of type number.  \nMISSING FIELD \nIf a collection contains documents in which not all fields contain a value, the missing values display as undefined. In the example below, the field age has no recorded value in 40% of the sampled documents.  \nSTRINGS \nStrings can appear in three different ways. If there are entirely unique strings in a field, Compass shows a random selection of string values from the specified field. Click the circular refresh icon to see a new set of randomly selected values from the field.  If there are only a few different string values, Compass shows the strings in a single graded bar which shows the percentage of the population of the string values.  If there are multiple string values with some duplicates, Compass shows a histogram indicating the frequency of each string found within the field.  \nNOTE Move the mouse over each bar to display a tooltip which shows the value of the string. \nNUMBERS \nNumbers are similar to strings in their representation. Unique numbers are shown in the following manner:  Duplicate numbers are shown in a histogram that indicates their frequency:  \nDATES AND OBJECTIDS \nFields that represent dates (and fields that contain the ObjectID data type, which includes a timestamp) are shown across multiple bar charts. The two charts on the top row represent the day of the week and time of day of the timestamp value.

 Click on the triangle to expand the field and view the embedded documents:  \nGEOJSON AND [LONGITUDE,LATITUDE] ARRAYS \nFields that contain GeoJSON data or [longitude,latitude] arrays are displayed with interactive maps. For more information on interacting with location data in Compass, see Analyze Location Data.  \nNOTE Third party mapping services are not available in Compass Isolated Edition. \nVIEW CHARTS OF MIXED TYPES \nIf a field has mixed types, you can view different charts of each type by clicking on the type field. In the example below, the age field shows the values that are strings:  Clicking on the number type causes the chart to show its numeric data:  \nQUERY BUILDER \nIn the Schema tab, you can type the filter manually into the query bar or generate the filter with the Compass query builder. The query builder allows you to select data elements from one or more fields in your schema and construct a query matching the selected elements. \nTIP You can compose the initial query filter by using the clickable query builder and then manually edit the generated filter to your exact requirements. The following procedure describes the steps involved in building a complex query with the query bar. 1 \nCLICK THE CHART VALUE. \nIn the Schema view, you can click on a chart value to build a query. For example, the following image shows the query filter built by clicking the EWR value for the departureAirportFsCode field. \n2 \nOPTIONAL. SELECT MULTIPLE VALUES. \nTo select multiple values for a field, click and drag the cursor over a selection of values, or press shift+click on the desired values. \n3 \nOPTIONAL. CLICK ON OTHER FIELD VALUES TO CREATE A COMPOUND QUERY. \nFor example, the following image shows shows the compound query built by selecting a value in the flightId field. \n4 \nOPTIONAL. DESELECT A VALUE. \nTo deselect a previously selected value, shift+click on the selected value: \n5 \nRUN THE QUERY \nTo run the query, click Analyze. Click Reset to clear your query. \nANALYZE LOCATION DATA \nIn the Schema tab, you can use interactive maps to filter and analyze location data. If your field contains GeoJSON data or [longitude,latitude] arrays, the Schema tab displays a map containing the points from the field. The data type for location fields is coordinates.  \nAPPLY A LOCATION FILTER \nYou can apply a filter to the map to only analyze a specific range of points. To define a location filter:  1. Click the Circle button at the top-right of the map.  2. Click and drag on the map to draw a circle containing the area of the map you want to analyze.  3. Repeat this process as desired to include additional areas of the map in the schema analysis.  The query bar updates as you draw location filters to show the exact coordinates used in the $geoWithin query applied to the schema analysis. If you specify multiple location filters, the query becomes an $or query with multiple $geoWithin operators. \nEDIT A LOCATION FILTER \nTo move or resize a location filter, click on the right side of the map. You will enter the filter editing mode, which looks like this: \nTo move a filterClick and drag the square in the center of the circle.To resize a filterClick and drag the square at the edge of the circle. After modifying your filters, click Save. \nDELETE A LOCATION FILTER \nTo delete a location filter from the map:  1. Click on the right side of the map.  2. Either click:\n    \n    * A location filter to delete that filter.\n    \n    * Clear All to delete all location filters.  3. Click Save. \nTROUBLESHOOTING \nIf the analysis of your schema times out, it might be because the collection you are analyzing is very large, causing MongoDB to stop the operation before the analysis is complete. Increase the value of MAX TIME MS to allow the operation time to complete. To increase the value of MAX TIME MS:  1. In the query bar, expand Options.\n    \n      2. Increase the value of MAX TIME MS to accommodate your collection. MAX TIME MS defaults to 60000 milliseconds, or 60 seconds, but large collections might take tens of seconds to analyze.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nFAQ \nOn this page    \n * What is the Compass Isolated Edition?\n   \n * What is the performance impact of running this tool?\n * How does Compass handle confidential data?\n * Does Compass Maintain Logs?\n * Why am I seeing a warning about a non-genuine MongoDB server?\n * What happens to long running queries?\n * Why are some features of MongoDB Compass not working?\n * How do I view and modify my Privacy Settings? \nWHAT IS THE COMPASS ISOLATED EDITION? \nCompass Isolated Edition restricts network requests to only the MongoDB server chosen on the Connect screen. All other outbound connections are not permitted in this edition, meaning no additional firewall configuration is required when running Compass Isolated Edition. \nWHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE IMPACT OF RUNNING THIS TOOL? \nTesting has shown that MongoDB Compass has minimal impact in prototype deployments, though additional performance testing and monitoring is in progress. You should only execute queries that are indexed appropriately in the database to avoid scanning the entire collection. \nHOW DOES COMPASS HANDLE CONFIDENTIAL DATA? \nMongoDB Compass stores and retrieves sensitive data such as passwords using a credentials API specific to the operating system running Compass. The credentials API securely handles sensitive information by encrypting and protecting access to your data. MongoDB Compass stores the following data using the credentials API:      * MongoDB server passwords,  * SSH passwords for tunneling,  * TLS/SSL passphrases MongoDB Compass utilizes a node.js native add-on, Keytar, to communicate with and store data in the operating system's credentials API. For more information on how Keytar operates and the specific APIs it accesses, refer to the Keytar Github documentation. \nDOES COMPASS MAINTAIN LOGS? \nAs part of normal operation, MongoDB Compass maintains a running log of events. Compass logs provide a history of operations and can help diagnose errors. For more information on Compass logs, including their format and location, see Retrieve Compass Logs. \nWHY AM I SEEING A WARNING ABOUT A NON-GENUINE MONGODB SERVER? \nStarting in MongoDB Compass 1.19, Compass displays a warning message when connected to non-genuine MongoDB instances as these instances may behave differently from the official MongoDB instances; e.g. missing or incomplete features, different feature behaviors, etc. \nWHAT HAPPENS TO LONG RUNNING QUERIES? \nAs a precaution, Compass aborts long running queries to prevent excessive querying on your database. \nSLOW SAMPLING \nAll queries that Compass sends to your MongoDB instance have a timeout flag set which automatically aborts a request if it takes longer than the specified timeout. This timeout is currently set to 10 seconds. If sampling on the database takes longer, Compass will notify you about the timeout and give you the options of (a) retrying with a longer timeout (60 seconds) or (b) running a different query. \nNOTE Sampling time may be affected by a number of factors, like load on the server, number of documents and existence of a suitable index for your query. It is recommended that you only increase the sampling timeout if you are not connected to a production instance, as this may negatively affect the performance and response time of your database. \nSLOW SCHEMA ANALYSIS \nIf the database returns documents faster than the specified timeout (10 or 60 seconds), but the schema analysis of the documents takes longer than expected (due to complex, large documents), Compass gives you the option to abort the analysis step and show the partial results. \nWHY ARE SOME FEATURES OF MONGODB COMPASS NOT WORKING? \nIf you can connect to your MongoDB instance using MongoDB Compass but some features do not work as expected, your system firewall may be blocking network requests required by MongoDB Compass. MongoDB Compass must connect to external services to enable features such as:  * Third party mapping services  * Intercom  * Bugsnag for error reporting To fix this issue, configure your system firewall to allow incoming connections for MongoDB Compass. Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open between MongoDB Compass and the host for the MongoDB deployment to which Compass connects. Compass Isolated Edition restricts network requests to only the MongoDB server chosen on the Connect screen. All other outbound connections are not permitted in this edition, meaning no additional firewall configuration is required when running Compass Isolated Edition. \nHOW DO I VIEW AND MODIFY MY PRIVACY SETTINGS? \nTo view and modify your MongoDB Compass privacy settings, from the top-level menu:  1. Click Help.  2. Click Settings.  3.

Aggregation Results\n * Create a View from Pipeline Results\n * Refresh Document Counts\n * Example New in version 1.14.0 The Aggregation Pipeline Builder in MongoDB Compass lets you create aggregation pipelines to process documents from a collection or view and return computed results. For example, you can use aggregation pipelines to:      * Group values from multiple documents together.  * Perform operations on the grouped data to return a single result.  * Analyze data changes over time. To build an aggregation pipeline, choose a collection and click the Aggregations tab. Compass displays a blank aggregation pipeline. The Preview of Documents in the Collection section shows 20 documents randomly sampled from the chosen collection. \nNOTE \nATLAS SEARCH STAGES When you connect Compass to a MongoDB deployment hosted on Atlas, additional Atlas-only stages $search and $searchMeta are available in the Aggregation Pipeline Builder. Use these stages to perform full-text search on Atlas collections. \nTASKS \nYou can use the Compass Aggregation Pipeline Builder to:  * Create a new aggregation pipeline  * Save a pipeline  * Open a saved pipeline  * Set maxTimeMS for Aggregation Queries  * Set the documents limit or auto preview documents  * View or change pipeline settings  * View the explain plan for pipelines  * Export Aggregation Results  * Specify custom collation  * Create a view from pipeline results  * Import a pipeline from plain text  * Export a pipeline to Java, Node, C#, and Python 3  * Refresh Document Counts \nLIMITATIONS \n * The $out stage is not available if you are connected to a Data Lake.  * You cannot run the Atlas Search $search or $searchMeta stages on a time series collection. \nCREATE AN AGGREGATION PIPELINE \nAggregation pipelines can be created in two seperate modes:  * Stage View Mode, a visual click-based pipeline editor that preloads pipeline syntax based on your selected stages.  * Text View Mode, a text-based pipeline editor that accepts raw pipeline syntax. \nSTAGE VIEW MODE  \n1 TOGGLE STAGE VIEW MODE \nIn the aggregation pipeline pane, ensure the {} Stages toggle switch is selected: \n2 ADD AN AGGREGATION PIPELINE STAGE. \nIn the aggregation pipeline pane in the lower-left corner, click the Select... dropdown and select the aggregation pipeline stage to use for the first stage of the pipeline: \n3 FILL IN THE PIPELINE STAGE. \nFill in your selected stage. If you enable Preview, preview documents update automatically to the right of the stage to reflect the results of your pipeline as it progresses. You can adjust the width of the pipeline stage by dragging its border to the right. \n4 ADD ADDITIONAL PIPELINE STAGES. \nClick Add Stage to add additional aggregation stages below your last aggregation stage. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each additional stage. \nNOTE The toggle to the right of the name of each pipeline stage dictates whether that stage is included in the pipeline. Toggling a pipeline stage also updates the pipeline preview, which reflects whether or not that stage is included. The following pipeline excludes the first $match stage and only includes the $project stage: \n5 RUN THE PIPELINE. \nClick Run at the top right of the pipeline builder. Compass returns your results in the document view. \nWARNING When you click Run, the aggregation runs against the entire collection. \n6 EDIT THE PIPELINE. \nClick Edit at the top of your pipeline toolbar to return to the aggregation pipeline builder. You can make changes to your pipeline from there. \nTEXT VIEW MODE  \n1 In the aggregation pipeline pane, click the </> Text toggle switch to enable text mode for pipeline editing. \n2 Enter valid aggregation syntax in the text editor. The following example pipeline limits the query results to 4 documents. [ { \"$limit\" : 4 } ]  3 (Optional) If preview mode is enabled, you can click Output Options in the Pipeline Output pane to expand all nested fields and documents within the preview results. \n4 Click Run at the top right of the pipeline builder. Compass returns your results in the document view. \n5 (Optional) Click the Output Options dropdown and select Expand all fields to expand all nested fields and documents within the query results.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nAUTHENTICATION CONNECTION TAB \nOn this page    \n * Procedure The Authentication tab allows you to connect to deployments that require authentication. To learn about authentication mechanisms within MongoDB, see Authentication Mechanisms. \nPROCEDURE \n1 \nCLICK ADVANCED CONNECTION OPTIONS.  2 \nCLICK THE AUTHENTICATION TAB. \nSelect your authentication method from the following options:      * Username / Password  * X.509  * Kerberos  * LDAP  * AWS IAM USERNAME / PASSWORD \nProvide the following information:  * Username  * Password  * (Optional) Authentication Database  * Authentication Mechancism:\n   \n   * Default\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     The Default setting selects the first authentication mechanism supported by the server according to an order of preference.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     With the Default setting, MongoDB tries to authenticate using the following mechanisms in the order they are listed:\n     \n     1. SCRAM-SHA-256\n     \n     2. SCRAM-SHA-1\n     \n     3. MONGODB-CR\n     \n     \n   \n   * SCRAM-SHA-1\n   \n   * SCRAM-SHA-256 X.509 \nSelect X.509 if the deployment uses X.509 as its authentication mechanism. \nNOTE X.509 Authentication requires a client certificate. To enable TLS and add a client certificate, see the TLS / SSL tab in Compass. KERBEROS \nSelect Kerberos if the deployment uses Kerberos as its authentication mechanism. Provide the following information: Field\nDescription\nPrincipal\nEvery participant in the authenticated communication is known as a \"principal\", and every principal must have a unique name.\n(Optional) Service Name\nEvery MongoDB mongod and mongos instance (or exe or exe on Windows) must have an associated service name. The default is mongodb.\n(Optional) Canonicalize Host Name\nKerberos uses the canonicalized form of the host name (cname) when constructing the principal for MongoDB Compass.\n(Optional) Service Realm The service realm is the domain over which a Kerberos authentication server has the authority to authenticate a user. If you choose to Canonicalize Host Name, you can specify one of the following options: Option\nDescription\nForward\nThe driver does a cname lookup on the kerberos hostname.\nForward and Reverse\nPerforms a forward DNS lookup and then a reverse lookup on that value to canonicalize the hostname. For more information on principal name canonicalization in Kerberos, see this RFC document. (Optional) Provide password directly\nUsed to verify your identity. AUTHENTICATE AS A DIFFERENT KERBEROS USER ON WINDOWS \nWhen you authenticate with Kerberos on Windows, the Principal you specify must match the principal of the security context that Compass is running. Normally, this is the logged-in user who is running Compass. To authenticate as a different Kerberos user, run MongoDB Compass as the chosen user and specify the Principal for that user. To run MongoDB Compass as a different user, either:  * Hold Shift and right-click the MongoDB Compass program icon to select Run as a different user.  * Use the runas command-line tool. For example, the following command runs MongoDB Compass as a user named admin:\n   \n   runas /profile /user:mymachine\\admin <path to MongoDB Compass>\n   \n    After you start MongoDB Compass as the chosen user, to authenticate against your Kerberos-enabled MongoDB deployment, specify the Principal for the corresponding user. LDAP \nSelect LDAP if the deployment uses LDAP as its authentication mechanism. Provide the following information:  * Username  * Password AWS IAM \nSelect AWS IAM if the deployment uses AWS IAM as its authentication mechanism. The following fields are optional as they can be defined on your platform using their respective AWS IAM environment variables. MongoDB Compass will use these environment variable values to authenticate; you do not need to specify them in the connection string.  * (Optional) AWS Access Key Id  * (Optional) AWS Secret Access

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nEXPORT SAVED CONNECTIONS WITH THE CLI \nOn this page    \n * About This Task\n   \n * Export Encrypted Saved Connections\n * Procedure\n * Example\n * Export Unencrypted Saved Connections\n * Procedure\n * Example\n * Next Steps You can use the Compass CLI to export saved connections. Colleagues can import your saved connections, or you can use them yourself in your other workspaces. \nABOUT THIS TASK \nWhen you export saved connections, Compass exports the list of connections as a JSON file. By default, when you export saved connections, passwords are included in plaintext. To protect sensitive connection information, encrypt the exported file with a passphrase. \nEXPORT ENCRYPTED SAVED CONNECTIONS \nThis section shows how to export encrypted saved connections. When you encrypt the export file, users must specify the matching passphrase to import the connections. \nPROCEDURE \nTo export encrypted saved connections with the Compass CLI, specify:      * The path to the MongoDB Compass executable. The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating system.  * The --export-connections option set to the destination of the output file.  * The --passphrase option set to a passphrase used to encrypt the output file. Your operation should resemble the following prototype: <path-to-Compass-executable> \\--export-connections=<filename> \\--passphrase=<passphrase>  \nEXAMPLE \nThis example exports saved Compass connections to a file with the path /tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json. The exported file is encrypted with the passphrase abc123. Run the following command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass executable: ./MongoDB\\ Compass \\--export-connections=/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json \\--passphrase=abc123  \nNOTE The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating system. The preceding command is for macOS.

This is useful for sharing your schema and comparing schemas across collections. If you have not already done so, analyze your schema:       1. Select your desired collection and click the Schema tab.  2. Click Analyze Schema. \nNOTE When Compass analyzes your schema, it samples a random subset of documents from your collection. To learn more about sampling, see Sampling. Once your schema has been analyzed, export your schema:  1. In the top menu bar, click Collection.  2. From the dropdown, click Share Schema as JSON.  Your schema is copied to your clipboard as a JSON object. \nSCHEMA OBJECT PROPERTIES \nSchema objects have count and fields properties:  * count is an integer that represents the number of documents sampled from the collection to generate the schema.  * fields is an array of metadata objects that correspond to each field in the documents analyzed during sampling. Each element in the fields array contains the following fields: Property\nData type\nDescription\nname\nString\nName of the corresponding field, e.g. _id.\npath\nString\nPath to the corresponding field within a document.\ncount\nInteger\nNumber of documents in which the corresponding field appears.\ntypes\nArray\nArray of metadata objects that represent each data type that appears in the corresponding field.\ntypes[n].name\nString\nName of this data type.\ntypes[n].bsonType\nString\nBSON type of this data type.\ntypes[n].path\nString\nPath to the corresponding field within a document.\ntypes[n].count\nInteger\nNumber of times this data type appears in the corresponding field.\ntypes[n].values\nArray\nArray of the actual sampled values that appear in the corresponding field and match this data type.\ntypes[n].total_count\nInteger\nIf the corresponding field is an array, the number of elements in that array.\ntypes[n].probability\nNumber\nProbability that the value of the corresponding field is this data type in a random document.\ntypes[n].unique\nInteger\nNumber of unique values of this data type that appear in the corresponding field.\ntypes[n].has_duplicates\nBoolean\ntrue if a single value of this data type appears multiple times in the corresponding field.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nQUERY YOUR DATA \nOn this page    \n * Set Query Filter\n   \n * Supported Data Types in the Query Bar\n * Clear the Query\n * How Does the Compass Query Compare to MongoDB and SQL Queries?\n * Examples You can type MongoDB filter documents into the query bar to display only documents which match the specified criteria. To learn more about querying documents, see Query Documents in the MongoDB manual. \nSET QUERY FILTER \n      1. In the Filter field, enter a filter document. You can use all of the MongoDB query operators except the $text and $expr operators.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    The following filter only returns documents which have a title value of Jurassic Park:\n    \n    { \"title\": \"Jurassic Park\" }\n    \n      2. Click Find to run the query and view the updated results.\n    \n    click to enlarge \nNOTE For query result sets larger than 1000 documents, Compass shows a sampling of the results. Otherwise, Compass shows the entire result set. For details on sampling, see Sampling. \nSUPPORTED DATA TYPES IN THE QUERY BAR \nThe Compass Filter supports using the mongo shell mode representation of the MongoDB Extended JSON BSON data types. \nEXAMPLE The following filter returns documents where start_date is greater than than the BSON Date 2017-05-01: { \"start_date\": {$gt: new Date('2017-05-01')} }  By specifying the Date type in both start_date and the $gt comparison operator, Compass performs the greater than comparison chronologically, returning documents with start_date later than 2017-05-01. Without the Date type specification, Compass compares the start_dates as strings lexicographically, instead of comparing the values chronologically. \nCLEAR THE QUERY \nTo clear the query bar and the results of the query, click Reset. \nHOW DOES THE COMPASS QUERY COMPARE TO MONGODB AND SQL QUERIES? \n$filter corresponds to the WHERE clause in a SQL SELECT statement. \nEXAMPLE You have 3,235 articles.

Compass Filter Option { author : { $eq : \"Joe Bloggs\" } } \nMongoDB Aggregation db.article.aggregate(  { $filter : { author : { $eq : \"Joe Bloggs\" } } }); \nSQL SELECT * FROM articleWHERE author = \"Joe Bloggs\";  \nEXAMPLES  EXAMPLE The following examples use the JSON documents below as sample data. To import this sample data to your MongoDB deployment with MongoDB Compass:  1. Copy the array of documents below by clicking Copy. [   {      \"name\":\"Andrea Le\",      \"email\":\"andrea_le@fakegmail.com\",      \"version\":5,      \"scores\":[85, 95, 75],      \"dateCreated\":{\"$date\":\"2003-03-26\"}   },   {      \"email\":\"no_name@fakegmail.com\",      \"version\":4,      \"scores\":[90, 90, 70],      \"dateCreated\":{\"$date\":\"2001-04-15\"}   },   {      \"name\":\"Greg Powell\",      \"email\":\"greg_powell@fakegmail.com\",      \"version\":1,      \"scores\":[65, 75, 80],      \"dateCreated\":{\"$date\":\"1999-02-10\"}   }]   2. In Compass, use the left navigation panel to select the database and the collection you want to import the data to.  3. Click the Documents tab.  4. Click Add Data and select Insert Document.  5. Ensure that View is set to JSON, or {}, and paste the copied JSON documents in the field.  6. Click Insert. \nNOTE If you do not have a MonogDB deployment or if you would like to query a large sample data set, see Sample Data for Atlas Clusters for instructions on creating a free-tier cluster with sample data.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nCOMPASS CONNECTION ERRORS \nOn this page    \n * MongoDB Not Running on the Provided Host and Port\n   \n * Insert Document Button Disabled and Cannot Modify Documents\n * Connection to Cluster Shard Closed\n * Not Master or Secondary is Not Writable\n * Authentication Failed\n * Check the Compass Logs\n * Additional Resources The sections on this page list common errors seen when connecting to MongoDB Compass and provide possible solutions. \nMONGODB NOT RUNNING ON THE PROVIDED HOST AND PORT \nYour connection failed when Compass attempted to connect to your database on the specified host and port. \nLIKELY CAUSES \nThis error often occurs when:      * You provide no hostname or an invalid hostname to the Compass connect dialog.  * The destination server rejects a connection on an incorrect port.  * Your MongoDB cluster or server has been shutdown or the server hostname has changed.  * You have a firewall actively blocking connections to/from your local network. \nSOLUTIONS \nThe solution to this issue may depend on how your MongoDB environment is configured. Select the appropriate tab for your MongoDB environment to view possible solutions:   INSERT DOCUMENT BUTTON DISABLED AND CANNOT MODIFY DOCUMENTS \nWhen using Compass, you may be in a state where you cannot perform any write operations, and can only read data. \nPOSSIBLE OBSERVATIONS \nWhen you are in this state:  * The Create Collection and Insert Document buttons are disabled.  * You cannot modify any of your documents. \nLIKELY CAUSE \nThere are two likely causes for this behavior:  * You are connected to a secondary member of your cluster, which does not support write operations.  * You are using Compass Readonly edition, which does not support write operations. \nSOLUTIONS \nCHECK READ PREFERENCE SETTING \nIn the Compass connection dialog, set your Read Preference to Primary. This will ensure that you connect to your cluster's primary member, which supports write operations. CHECK REPLICA SET NAME \nCheck that your Replica Set Name is accurate. Compass is only able to identify the primary correctly if the replica set name is accurate. If your cluster is hosted in Atlas, you can obtain the correct replica set name using the following procedure:  1. Navigate to your Atlas Clusters view.  2. Click Connect for your desired cluster.  3. Click Connect with MongoDB Compass.  4. Copy the provided connection string.  5. Open MongoDB Compass.  6. Click Yes to auto-fill the connection settings.\n    \n     CHECK YOUR COMPASS EDITION \nYou cannot perform write operations in Compass Readonly edition. You can check your Compass edition by opening the top-level Compass dropdown menu and selecting About MongoDB Compass.
