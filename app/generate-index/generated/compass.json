Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nSET VALIDATION RULES FOR YOUR SCHEMA \nOn this page    \n * Validation Tab\n   \n * Validation Rules\n * Validation Actions and Levels\n * Limitations \nVALIDATION TAB \nThe Validation tab allows you to manage schema validation rules for a collection. Schema validation ensures that all documents in a collection follow a defined set of rules, such as conforming to a specific shape or only allowing a specified range of values in fields.  \nVALIDATION RULES \nUpdated in version 1.18. The validation editor supports JSON Schema validation, and validation with query expressions using query operators. As you edit your validation, Compass updates in real-time to display a document from your collection that passes the validation and a document that fails. \nJSON SCHEMA VALIDATION \nTo specify JSON Schema validation, use the $jsonSchema operator. {   $jsonSchema: {      required: ['customer'], // the customer field is required      properties: {      purchaseMethod: {         enum: ['In Store','Online'],         description: \"can only be either 'In Store' or 'Online'\"      }      }   }}  The $jsonSchema operator supports various keywords to specify validation rules. For example:      * The required array defines required fields in your document.  * The properties object defines rules for specific documentfields. Consider the following example validation: {   $jsonSchema: {      bsonType: \"object\",      required: [ \"name\", \"year\", \"major\", \"gpa\", \"address.city\", \"address.street\" ],      properties: {         name: {            bsonType: \"string\",            description: \"must be a string\"         },         year: {            bsonType: \"int\",            minimum: 2017,            maximum: 3017,            exclusiveMaximum: false,            description: \"must be an integer in [ 2017, 3017 ]\"         },         major: {            bsonType: \"string\",            enum: [ \"Math\", \"English\", \"Computer Science\", \"History\", null ],            description: \"can only be one of the enum values\"         },         gpa: {            bsonType: [ \"double\" ],            minimum: 0,            description: \"must be a double\"         }      }   }}  This validation specifies:  * The list of required fields.  * The bsonType for all fields.  * The minimum and maximum values for the year field.  * The acceptable values for the major field, using enum.  * The minimum value for the gpa field. For all available $jsonSchema keywords, refer to the $jsonSchema page in the MongoDB manual. \nVALIDATION USING QUERY OPERATORS \nYou can also specify validation using query operators, with the exception of the following query operators: $near, $nearSphere, $text, and $where. {   $or: [      { phone: { $type: \"string\" } },      { email: { $regex: /@mongodb\\.com$/ } },      { status: { $in: [ \"Unknown\", \"Incomplete\" ] } }   ]}  Using this validation, one of the following must be true:  * The phone field must be BSON type string,  * The email field must match the regex

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nRESOURCES TO LEARN AND EXPLORE MONGODB \nOn this page    \n * Free MongoDB Courses Online\n   \n * Free MongoDB Cluster for Learning and Testing\n * MongoDB Server Installation\n * Resources and Documentation\n * MongoDB Community Forums The following sections outline methods to learn MongoDB basics and best practices. \nFREE MONGODB COURSES ONLINE \nTo help you get started with MongoDB Compass and the MongoDB database, see the MongoDB University course M001. This course provides access to a student cluster for learning about MongoDB. If you are looking to learn more about MongoDB technologies, there are other available courses to help you along the way. All courses are available at no charge. In the course catalog, you will find courses on:      * Development in Java, Node.js, Python,  * New features and tools available in the latest version of MongoDB,  * Cluster administration,  * Aggregation,  * Performance, and more. \nFREE MONGODB CLUSTER FOR LEARNING AND TESTING \nIf you would like to use a hosted instance of MongoDB rather than set up a local server, you can set up a free M0 cluster on Atlas, MongoDB's hosted database as a service. The M0 tier cluster is ideal for learning and testing. Once the cluster is set up, you can use the Connect button in the Atlas interface to obtain the correct Compass connection settings for your cluster.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nEMBEDDED MONGODB SHELL \nOn this page    \n * Open the Embedded MongoDB Shell\n   \n * Use the Embedded MongoDB Shell\n * Disable the Embedded MongoDB Shell Starting in version 1.22, MongoDB Compass contains an embedded shell, mongosh. mongosh is a JavaScript environment for interacting with MongoDB deployments. You can use mongosh to test queries and operations in your database. \nOPEN THE EMBEDDED MONGODB SHELL \nTo open the embedded mongosh, click _MONGOSH at the bottom of the MongoDB Compass window. \nUSE THE EMBEDDED MONGODB SHELL \nBy default, mongosh, connects to the test database. To use a different database, run the following command in mongosh: use <database name>  To run an operation in the embedded MongoDB Shell, type the operation into the shell and press Enter. The following example runs a db.collection.find() operation: \nEXAMPLE db.employees.find( { \"last_name\": \"Smith\" } )  \nMULTI-LINE OPERATIONS IN THE EMBEDDED MONGODB SHELL \nTo write an operation that spans multiple lines in the embedded mongosh, begin with the first line, then press Shift + Enter to move to the next line of code. When you are finished writing your operation, press Enter to run it.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nMANAGE INDEXES \nOn this page    \n * Indexes Tab\n   \n * Create an Index\n * Drop an Index\n * Limitations Indexes are special data structures that improve query performance. Indexes store a portion of a collection's data in an easy-to-traverse form. The index stores the value of a specific field or set of fields, ordered by the value of the field. To improve query performance, build indexes on fields that appear often in queries and for all operations that sort by a field.      * Queries on an indexed field can use the index to limit the number of documents that must be scanned to find matching documents.  * Sort operations on an indexed field can return documents pre-sorted by the index. To learn more about indexes, see Indexes. \nNOTE \nCONSIDERATIONS Indexes have some negative performance impact on write operations. For collections with high write-to-read ratio, indexes are expensive since each insert must also update any indexes. For a detailed list of considerations for indexes, see Operational Considerations for Indexes. \nINDEXES TAB \nThe Indexes tab lists the existing indexes for a collection. To access the Indexes tab for a collection, click on the collection on the left hand pane and select the Indexes tab.  For each index, Compass displays the following information: Name and Definition\nThe name of the index and keys.\nType\nRegular, text, geospatial or hashed index.\nSize\nHow large the index is.\nUsage\nNumber of times the index has been used since the time the index was created or the last server restart.\nProperties\nAny special properties (such as uniqueness, partial) of the index. \nCREATE AN INDEX \nTo create an index on a collection via Compass, the collection must contain documents. 1 \nCLICK THE CREATE INDEX BUTTON. \nFrom the Indexes tab, click the Create Index button to bring up the Create Index dialog. 2 \nOPTIONAL. ENTER THE INDEX NAME. \nIn the dialog, enter the name of the index to create, or leave blank to have MongoDB create a default name for the index. 3 \nADD FIELDS TO INDEX. \n a. Specify an index key.\n    \n    * To specify an existing document field as an index key, select the field from the dropdown list.\n    \n    * To specify a field which does not exist in any document as an index key, enter the field name in the input box.\n    \n    * To create a compound index, click Add Another Field.  b. Use the dropdown to the right of each field name to specify the index type (ascending, descending, or 2dsphere). \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: To learn how to specify a wildcard index, see Wildcard Indexes. 4 \nOPTIONAL. SPECIFY THE INDEX OPTIONS. \nCompass supports the following index options: Option\nDescription\nMore Information\nBuild index in the background\nEnsure that the MongoDB deployment remains available duringthe index build operation.\nBackground Construction\nCreate unique index\nEnsure that the indexed fields do not store duplicate values.\nUnique Indexes\nCreate a TTL index\nDelete documents automatically after a specified number of seconds since the indexed field value.\nTTL Indexes\nPartial filter expression Index only the documents which match the specified filter expression. \nEXAMPLE The following partial filter expression only indexes documents where the timezone field exists: { \"timezone\": { \"$exists\": true } } \nPartial Indexes\nUse custom collation\nCreate a custom collation for the index using the options provided in Compass.\nCollation Document\nWildcard projection (New in MongoDB 4.2) Support unknown or arbitrary fields which match the specified projection in the index. To use a wildcard projection, set your index field name to $**. This directs Compass to use all fields in the document (excluding _id). \nEXAMPLE Consider the following wildcard projection document: {  \"product_attributes.elements\" : 1,  \"product_attributes.resistance\" : 1}  If your index field name is $**, your index only includes the values of the fields in that projection. Wildcard Indexes 5 \nCLICK CREATE INDEX.  WILDCARD INDEXES \nNew in version v4.2. You can create wildcard indexes to support queries against unknown or arbitrary fields.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nCONNECT TO MONGODB \nOn this page    \n * Considerations\n   \n * Connect\n * Connecting with Compass from the Command Line\n * Advanced Connection Options This page outlines how to use MongoDB Compass to connect to a MongoDB host. You can connect to a standalone, replica set, or sharded cluster host. \nNOTE \nMONGODB ATLAS If you need to create a MongoDB host, consider using MongoDB Atlas. Atlas is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service which requires no installation, offers a free tier to get started, and provides a copyable URI to easily connect Compass to your deployment. If you need to install Compass, see Download and Install Compass for instructions. \nCONSIDERATIONS \n     * When connecting Compass to a replica set, it is not recommended to connect directly to an individual replica set member. If the member to which you are connected switches from a primary member to a secondary or vice versa as the result of an election, Compass may either forcibly close the connection or display stale data.\n   \n   Instead, to connect to a replica set, use either the replica set SRV record or Replica Set Name when filling in your connection information.  * Starting in MongoDB Compass 1.19, Compass displays a warning message when connected to non-genuine MongoDB instances as these instances may behave differently from the official MongoDB instances; e.g. missing or incomplete features, different feature behaviors, etc. \nCONNECT \nWhen you open Compass, an initial connection dialog appears:  You can connect your deployments by either:  * Providing your connection string.  * Specifying Advanced Connection Options. Advanced connection options allow you to specify authentication, TLS/SSL, and SSH connection options. To learn more, see Advanced Connection Options. \nPASTE CONNECTION STRING \nWhen you provide a connection string, Compass supports most Connection String Options supported by MongoDB. By default, Compass's default socketTimeoutMS value is 60000, or 60 seconds. If you are frequently experiencing timeouts in Compass, consider setting this option to a higher value in your connection string. For a complete list of the connection string options that Compass supports, see the Compass Connection README on GitHub. 1 PASTE YOUR CONNECTION STRING. \nIf you have the connection string for your deployment available, you can paste the string directly into the dialog box. You can use either the Standard Connection String Format or the DNS Seedlist Connection Format.  * To obtain the connection string for an Atlas cluster:\n   \n   a. Navigate to your Atlas Clusters view.\n   \n   b. Click Connect for your desired cluster.\n   \n   c. Click Connect with MongoDB Compass.\n   \n   d.

This count might differ from the actual document count in the collection. For example, an unexpected shutdown can throw off the count. Use the db.collection.countDocuments() method for the most accurate document count.  * Average size of documents in the collection  * Total size of all documents in the collection  * Number of indexes on the collection  * Total size of all indexes on the collection  * Collation properties for the collection. Hover over a Collation banner to view the properties for that collection. \nCREATE A COLLECTION \nYou can create new collections in an existing database. 1 \nCLICK THE CREATE COLLECTION BUTTON. \nFrom the Collections screen, click the Create Collection button. 2 \nENTER THE COLLECTION INFORMATION. \nIn the Create Collection dialog, enter the name of the collection to create.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nSAMPLING \nSampling in MongoDB Compass is the selection of a subset of documents from a collection for analysis. Analyzing a sample set of data is a common statistical analysis technique; the results of analyzing a sample set tend to be similar to the results of analyzing an entire data set. Compass uses sampling for efficiency. Generally, standard sample sets can be selected and analyzed in a few seconds. Analyzing large samples or entire collections demands significantly more time and processing power. \nSAMPLING METHOD \nMongoDB Compass samples 1,000 documents from a collection using the $sample operator via the aggregation pipeline.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nANALYZE YOUR DATA SCHEMA \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Query Bar\n * Field Descriptions\n * Query Builder\n * Analyze Location Data\n * Troubleshooting \nOVERVIEW \nThe Schema tab provides an overview of the data type and shape of the fields in a particular collection. Databases and collections are visible in the left-side navigation. The overview is based on sampling the documents in the collection. The schema overview may include additional data about the contents of the fields, such as the minimum and maximum values of dates and integers, the frequency of occurrence of particular values, and the cardinality of the data. MongoDB has a flexible schema model, which means that some fields may contain different types of data from one document to the next. For example, a field named address may contain strings and integers in some documents, objects in others, or some combination of all three. In the case of heterogenous fields, the Schema tab shows a breakdown of the various data types contained within the field with the percentage of each data type represented. \nEXAMPLE The Schema tab shows size information about the test.restaurants collection at the top, including the total number of documents in the collection, the average document size, and the total disk space occupied by the collection. The following fields are shown with details:      * The _id field is an ObjectId. Each ObjectId contains a timestamp, so Compass displays the range of creation times for the sampled documents.  * The address field contains four nested fields. You can expand the field panel to see analyses of each of the nested fields.  * The borough field contains a string indicating the borough in which the restaurant is located. The cardinality is low enough that Compass can provide a graded bar of the field contents, with the most-frequently occurring string on the left.  * The categories field contains arrays of strings. The analysis shows the minimum, maximum, and average array lengths.  \nQUERY BAR \nUsing the query bar in the Schema tab, you can create a query filter to limit your result set. Click the Options button to specify query options, such as the particular fields to display and the number of results to return.  \nTIP In the Schema tab, you can also use the Query Builder to enter a query into the query bar. \nFIELD DESCRIPTIONS \nFor each field, Compass displays summary information about the data type or types the field contains and the range of values. Depending on the data type and the level of cardinality, Compass displays histograms, graded bars, geographical maps, and sample data to provide a sense of the shape and scope of the data contained in each field. \nFIELD WITH A SINGLE DATA TYPE \nBelow is an example of the data type summary for a field called last_login which contains data of type date.  \nFIELD WITH MULTIPLE DATA TYPES \nFor fields that contain multiple data types, Compass displays a percentage breakdown of the various data types across documents. In the example below, the chart shows the contents of a field called phone_no in which 81% of documents are of type string, and the remaining 19% are of type number.  \nMISSING FIELD \nIf a collection contains documents in which not all fields contain a value, the missing values display as undefined. In the example below, the field age has no recorded value in 40% of the sampled documents.  \nSTRINGS \nStrings can appear in three different ways. If there are entirely unique strings in a field, Compass shows a random selection of string values from the specified field. Click the circular refresh icon to see a new set of randomly selected values from the field.  If there are only a few different string values, Compass shows the strings in a single graded bar which shows the percentage of the population of the string values.  If there are multiple string values with some duplicates, Compass shows a histogram indicating the frequency of each string found within the field.  \nNOTE Move the mouse over each bar to display a tooltip which shows the value of the string. \nNUMBERS \nNumbers are similar to strings in their representation. Unique numbers are shown in the following manner:  Duplicate numbers are shown in a histogram that indicates their frequency:  \nDATES AND OBJECTIDS \nFields that represent dates (and fields that contain the ObjectID data type, which includes a timestamp) are shown across multiple bar charts. The two charts on the top row represent the day of the week and time of day of the timestamp value.

 Click on the triangle to expand the field and view the embedded documents:  \nGEOJSON AND [LONGITUDE,LATITUDE] ARRAYS \nFields that contain GeoJSON data or [longitude,latitude] arrays are displayed with interactive maps. For more information on interacting with location data in Compass, see Analyze Location Data.  \nNOTE Third party mapping services are not available in Compass Isolated Edition. \nVIEW CHARTS OF MIXED TYPES \nIf a field has mixed types, you can view different charts of each type by clicking on the type field. In the example below, the age field shows the values that are strings:  Clicking on the number type causes the chart to show its numeric data:  \nQUERY BUILDER \nIn the Schema tab, you can type the filter manually into the query bar or generate the filter with the Compass query builder. The query builder allows you to select data elements from one or more fields in your schema and construct a query matching the selected elements. \nTIP You can compose the initial query filter by using the clickable query builder and then manually edit the generated filter to your exact requirements. The following procedure describes the steps involved in building a complex query with the query bar. 1 \nCLICK THE CHART VALUE. \nIn the Schema view, you can click on a chart value to build a query. For example, the following image shows the query filter built by clicking the EWR value for the departureAirportFsCode field. \n2 \nOPTIONAL. SELECT MULTIPLE VALUES. \nTo select multiple values for a field, click and drag the cursor over a selection of values, or press shift+click on the desired values. \n3 \nOPTIONAL. CLICK ON OTHER FIELD VALUES TO CREATE A COMPOUND QUERY. \nFor example, the following image shows shows the compound query built by selecting a value in the flightId field. \n4 \nOPTIONAL. DESELECT A VALUE. \nTo deselect a previously selected value, shift+click on the selected value: \n5 \nRUN THE QUERY \nTo run the query, click Analyze. Click Reset to clear your query. \nANALYZE LOCATION DATA \nIn the Schema tab, you can use interactive maps to filter and analyze location data. If your field contains GeoJSON data or [longitude,latitude] arrays, the Schema tab displays a map containing the points from the field. The data type for location fields is coordinates.  \nAPPLY A LOCATION FILTER \nYou can apply a filter to the map to only analyze a specific range of points. To define a location filter:  1. Click the Circle button at the top-right of the map.  2. Click and drag on the map to draw a circle containing the area of the map you want to analyze.  3. Repeat this process as desired to include additional areas of the map in the schema analysis.  The query bar updates as you draw location filters to show the exact coordinates used in the $geoWithin query applied to the schema analysis. If you specify multiple location filters, the query becomes an $or query with multiple $geoWithin operators. \nEDIT A LOCATION FILTER \nTo move or resize a location filter, click on the right side of the map. You will enter the filter editing mode, which looks like this: \nTo move a filterClick and drag the square in the center of the circle.To resize a filterClick and drag the square at the edge of the circle. After modifying your filters, click Save. \nDELETE A LOCATION FILTER \nTo delete a location filter from the map:  1. Click on the right side of the map.  2. Either click:\n    \n    * A location filter to delete that filter.\n    \n    * Clear All to delete all location filters.  3. Click Save. \nTROUBLESHOOTING \nIf the analysis of your schema times out, it might be because the collection you are analyzing is very large, causing MongoDB to stop the operation before the analysis is complete. Increase the value of MAX TIME MS to allow the operation time to complete. To increase the value of MAX TIME MS:  1. In the query bar, expand Options.\n    \n      2. Increase the value of MAX TIME MS to accommodate your collection. MAX TIME MS defaults to 60000 milliseconds, or 60 seconds, but large collections might take tens of seconds to analyze.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nVIEWS \nOn this page    \n * Collections Screen\n   \n * Create a View\n * Open a View\n * Duplicate a View\n * Modify the Source of a View\n * Drop a View Views are read-only results of an aggregation run against a collection. Views provide easy access to the results of an aggregation without requiring the reader of the view to execute the pipeline. Views can also help keep your data secure by only giving users access to a predefined result set, as opposed to having access to the underlying collection. \nCOLLECTIONS SCREEN \nThe Collections screen lists the existing collections and views in the selected database. Each list item includes the name and other general information for the collection or view. To access the Collections screen for a database, from the Databases screen either:      * Click a Database Name in the main Databases view, or  * Click a database in the left navigation.  Compass displays views in the Collections Screen with a special icon, and indicates the collection from which the view was created.  \nVIEW INFORMATION \nThe Collections screen displays the following information for each view in the selected database:  * View name  * Collection from which the view was created  * Total size of all documents in the view  * Total size of all indexes on the collection \nCREATE A VIEW \nTo create a view, you must use the Aggregation Pipeline Builder. The output of your pipeline's final stage becomes the content of the view. To create a view from your pipeline results:  1. Create an aggregation pipeline in the pipeline builder. For detailed instructions on using the pipeline builder, see Create an Aggregation Pipeline.  2. Click the arrow next to the Save button at the top of the pipeline builder.  3. Click Create a View.  4. Enter a name for your view.  5. Click Create. Compass creates a view from your pipeline results in the same database where the pipeline was created. \nOPEN A VIEW \nTo open a view, either:  * Click the desired view from the Collections screen, or  * Click the desired view in the left-hand navigation. After you open a view, Compass shows you that view's Documents Tab.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nDATABASES \nOn this page    \n * Databases Tab\n   \n * Create a Database\n * Drop a Database\n * Limitations A database is a container for collections. Each database gets its own set of files on the host file system. A single MongoDB server typically has multiple databases. \nDATABASES TAB \nThe Databases tab lists the existing databases for your MongoDB deployment. To access the Databases tab, click the cluster name in the upper left corner and select the Databases tab.  From this view, you can click a database name in the list to view its collections. Alternatively, you can view database collections by clicking the desired database in the left-hand navigation. You can also create or drop databases from this view. \nCREATE A DATABASE \n1 \nCLICK THE CREATE DATABASE BUTTON. \nFrom the Databases tab, click the Create Database button to bring up the Create Database dialog. 2 \nENTER DATABASE AND FIRST COLLECTION INFORMATION. \nIn the dialog, enter the name of the database to create and its first collection. Both the database name and the collection name are required. If you want to create a capped collection, select the Capped Collection checkbox and enter the maximum bytes. If you want to use custom collation on the collection, select the Use Custom Collation checkbox and select the desired collation settings. If your deployment is connected using In-Use Encryption, you can use Queryable Encryption on the newly created collection. Check the Queryable Encryption option and indicate the following encryption properties:      * Encrypted Fields.  * (Optional) KMS Provider.  * (Optional) Key Encryption Key. 3 \nCLICK CREATE DATABASE TO CREATE THE DATABASE AND ITS FIRST COLLECTION.  DROP A DATABASE \n1 \nCLICK THE TRASH CAN ICON FOR THE DATABASE. \nFrom the Databases tab, to delete a database, click on the trash can icon for that database. A confirmation dialog appears. 2 \nCONFIRM THE DATABASE TO DELETE. \nIn the dialog, enter the name of the database to delete. 3 \nCLICK DROP DATABASE TO DELETE THE DATABASE.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nCOMPASS CONFIGURATION FILE \nOn this page    \n * Use Cases\n   \n * Configuration File Location\n * Behavior\n * Tasks You can configure MongoDB Compass settings using a configuration file. Configure settings with a configuration file to maintain consistent behavior between Compass sessions. \nUSE CASES \nUse the configuration file to specify Compass settings and behaviors. For example:      * If your deployment has strict privacy requirements, you can configure Compass to block outgoing network connections.  * If you need to restrict what actions users can perform in Compass, you can disable the embedded shell and make Compass read-only.  * If you have multiple team members using Compass, you can use a common configuration file to ensure a consistent user experience. \nCONFIGURATION FILE LOCATION \n * For macOS and Linux, the configuration file is located at /etc/mongodb-compass.conf.  * For Windows, the configuration file is located at <path\\to\\compass>\\..\\mongodb-compass.cfg. \nBEHAVIOR \nWhen you configure settings with a configuration file:  * You can not modify settings set in the configuration file after startup.  * You can specify the configuration file in either EJSON or YAML format.  * To view all available Compass configuration options, run the following command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nFAQ \nOn this page    \n * What is the Compass Isolated Edition?\n   \n * What is the performance impact of running this tool?\n * How does Compass handle confidential data?\n * Does Compass Maintain Logs?\n * Why am I seeing a warning about a non-genuine MongoDB server?\n * What happens to long running queries?\n * Why are some features of MongoDB Compass not working?\n * How do I view and modify my Privacy Settings? \nWHAT IS THE COMPASS ISOLATED EDITION? \nCompass Isolated Edition restricts network requests to only the MongoDB server chosen on the Connect screen. All other outbound connections are not permitted in this edition, meaning no additional firewall configuration is required when running Compass Isolated Edition. \nWHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE IMPACT OF RUNNING THIS TOOL? \nTesting has shown that MongoDB Compass has minimal impact in prototype deployments, though additional performance testing and monitoring is in progress. You should only execute queries that are indexed appropriately in the database to avoid scanning the entire collection. \nHOW DOES COMPASS HANDLE CONFIDENTIAL DATA? \nMongoDB Compass stores and retrieves sensitive data such as passwords using a credentials API specific to the operating system running Compass. The credentials API securely handles sensitive information by encrypting and protecting access to your data. MongoDB Compass stores the following data using the credentials API:      * MongoDB server passwords,  * SSH passwords for tunneling,  * TLS/SSL passphrases MongoDB Compass utilizes a node.js native add-on, Keytar, to communicate with and store data in the operating system's credentials API. For more information on how Keytar operates and the specific APIs it accesses, refer to the Keytar Github documentation. \nDOES COMPASS MAINTAIN LOGS? \nAs part of normal operation, MongoDB Compass maintains a running log of events. Compass logs provide a history of operations and can help diagnose errors. For more information on Compass logs, including their format and location, see Retrieve Compass Logs. \nWHY AM I SEEING A WARNING ABOUT A NON-GENUINE MONGODB SERVER? \nStarting in MongoDB Compass 1.19, Compass displays a warning message when connected to non-genuine MongoDB instances as these instances may behave differently from the official MongoDB instances; e.g. missing or incomplete features, different feature behaviors, etc. \nWHAT HAPPENS TO LONG RUNNING QUERIES? \nAs a precaution, Compass aborts long running queries to prevent excessive querying on your database. \nSLOW SAMPLING \nAll queries that Compass sends to your MongoDB instance have a timeout flag set which automatically aborts a request if it takes longer than the specified timeout. This timeout is currently set to 10 seconds. If sampling on the database takes longer, Compass will notify you about the timeout and give you the options of (a) retrying with a longer timeout (60 seconds) or (b) running a different query. \nNOTE Sampling time may be affected by a number of factors, like load on the server, number of documents and existence of a suitable index for your query. It is recommended that you only increase the sampling timeout if you are not connected to a production instance, as this may negatively affect the performance and response time of your database. \nSLOW SCHEMA ANALYSIS \nIf the database returns documents faster than the specified timeout (10 or 60 seconds), but the schema analysis of the documents takes longer than expected (due to complex, large documents), Compass gives you the option to abort the analysis step and show the partial results. \nWHY ARE SOME FEATURES OF MONGODB COMPASS NOT WORKING? \nIf you can connect to your MongoDB instance using MongoDB Compass but some features do not work as expected, your system firewall may be blocking network requests required by MongoDB Compass. MongoDB Compass must connect to external services to enable features such as:  * Third party mapping services  * Intercom  * Bugsnag for error reporting To fix this issue, configure your system firewall to allow incoming connections for MongoDB Compass. Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open between MongoDB Compass and the host for the MongoDB deployment to which Compass connects. Compass Isolated Edition restricts network requests to only the MongoDB server chosen on the Connect screen. All other outbound connections are not permitted in this edition, meaning no additional firewall configuration is required when running Compass Isolated Edition. \nHOW DO I VIEW AND MODIFY MY PRIVACY SETTINGS? \nTo view and modify your MongoDB Compass privacy settings, from the top-level menu:  1. Click Help.  2. Click Settings.  3.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nIMPORT PIPELINE FROM TEXT \nOn this page    \n * Syntax\n   \n * Procedure You can import aggregation pipelines from plain text into the Aggregation Pipeline Builder to easily modify and execute your pipelines. Importing a plain text aggregation pipeline shows how each stage of the pipeline affects the output, and illustrates the effects of modifying specific pipeline stages using the Pipeline Builder's Output panes. \nNOTE \nIMPORTING PIPELINES FROM TEXT Starting in Compass 1.35, the import pipeline button has been removed from the Compass GUI. The full functionality of importing pipelines from text is still supported as part of the View Pipeline as Text edit mode. \nSYNTAX \nThe imported pipeline must be:      * In the MongoDB query language, this is the same syntax used in the pipeline parameter of the aggregate() method.  * An array, even if there is only one stage in the pipeline. \nPROCEDURE \n1 In the aggregation pipeline pane, click the </> Text toggle switch to enable text mode for pipeline editing. \n2 Type or paste an aggregation pipeline into the text editor. The text editor provides real-time linting for correct syntax and debugging information. For example, the following pipeline consists of a single $limit stage: [ { \"$limit\" : 4 } ]  \nAfter you import your pipeline, you can click the {} Stages switch to return to stage view mode.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nUPDATE MONGODB COMPASS \nOn this page    \n * Manually Install the Latest Version of Compass\n   \n * Enable Automatic Updates\n * Allow Keychain Access for Recent and Favorite Connections\n * Migrate to Compass from Compass Community To ensure that you are using the latest Compass features and improvements, it is recommended to use the latest version of MongoDB Compass. To upgrade Compass, you can either manually install the latest version or enable automatic updates. \nMANUALLY INSTALL THE LATEST VERSION OF COMPASS \nYou can download and install the latest version of Compass from the MongoDB Downloads page at any time. Check the Software Requirements for your operating system and desired version of Compass to ensure Compass is compatible with your system. You do not need to uninstall previous versions of Compass to upgrade. \nNOTE If you are running macOS Catalina or later, you may have to modify your system settings to grant Compass permission to run. For more information, see Install Compass. \nENABLE AUTOMATIC UPDATES \nYou can enable automatic updates to the latest version of Compass on the Help > Privacy Settings dialog.  MongoDB Compass does not install any updates without your explicit permission. Instead, Compass prompts you to upgrade when a new version is available. \nALLOW KEYCHAIN ACCESS FOR RECENT AND FAVORITE CONNECTIONS \nOn macOS systems, the first time that you update MongoDB Compass to version 1.20 or later, you will need to allow access to your system storage for each saved connection in Recents and Favorites. When prompted for your keychain password, click Always Allow to prevent being prompted for your password in the future. This ensures MongoDB Compass has access to your saved connections when updating to new versions. \nMIGRATE TO COMPASS FROM COMPASS COMMUNITY \nTo migrate from Compass Community edition to the fully-featured edition of Compass and retain any saved data such as saved connection strings and favorite queries, you must migrate that data to your new edition of MongoDB Compass. MongoDB Compass stores saved connections, queries, and aggregation pipelines in folders in your file system.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nIMPORT AND EXPORT DATA \nOn this page    \n * Import Data into a Collection\n   \n * Export Data from a Collection\n * Import and Export Data from the Command Line You can use MongoDB Compass to import and export data to and from collections. Compass supports import and export for both JSON and CSV files. To import or export data to or from a collection, navigate to the detailed collection view by either selecting the collection from the Databases tab or clicking the collection in the left-side navigation. \nIMPORT DATA INTO A COLLECTION \nMongoDB Compass can import data into a collection from either a JSON or CSV file. \nLIMITATIONS \n     * Importing data into a collection is not permitted in MongoDB Compass Readonly Edition.  * Importing data is not available if you are connected to a Data Lake. \nFORMAT YOUR DATA \nBefore you can import your data into MongoDB Compass you must first ensure that it is formatted correctly.   PROCEDURE \nTo import your formatted data into a collection: 1 CONNECT TO THE DEPLOYMENT CONTAINING THE COLLECTION YOU WISH TO IMPORT DATA INTO. \nTo learn how to connect to a deployment, see Connect to MongoDB. 2 NAVIGATE TO YOUR TARGET COLLECTION. \nYou can either select the collection from the Collections tab or click the collection in the left-hand pane. 3 CLICK THE ADD DATA DROPDOWN AND SELECT IMPORT FILE.  \nCompass displays the following dialog: \n4 SELECT THE LOCATION OF THE SOURCE DATA FILE UNDER SELECT FILE. \n5 CHOOSE THE APPROPRIATE FILE TYPE. \nUnder Select Input File Type, select either JSON or CSV. If you are importing a CSV file, you may specify fields to import and the types of those fields under Specify Fields and Types. The default data type for all fields is string.  To exclude a field from a CSV file you are importing, uncheck the checkbox next to that field name. To select a type for a field, use the dropdown menu below that field name. 6 CONFIGURE IMPORT OPTIONS. \nUnder Options, configure the import options for your use case. If you are importing a CSV file, you may select how your data is delimited. For both JSON and CSV file imports, you can toggle Ignore empty strings and Stop on errors:  * If checked, Ignore empty strings drops fields with empty string values from your imported documents. The document is still imported with all other fields.  * If checked, Stop on errors prevents any data from being imported in the event of an error. If unchecked, data is inserted until an error is encountered and successful inserts are not rolled back. The import operation will not continue after encountering an error in either case. 7 CLICK IMPORT. \nA progress bar displays the status of the import. If an error occurs during import, the progress bar turns red and an error message appears in the dialog. After successful import, the dialog closes and Compass displays the collection page containing the newly imported documents. \nEXPORT DATA FROM A COLLECTION \nMongoDB Compass can export data from a collection as either a JSON or CSV file. If you specify a filter or aggregation pipeline for your collection, Compass only exports documents which match the specified query or pipeline results. \nBEHAVIOR \nWhile it is possible to exclude documents by using a query filter, it is not possible to re-shape exported documents with a project document. Even when you specify a project option in the query, Compass still exports the entire document. \nPROCEDURE   \nIMPORT AND EXPORT DATA FROM THE COMMAND LINE \nTo import and export data from the command line, you can use MongoDB's Database Tools. See mongoimport and mongoexport. ←  Compass Command Line OptionsEmbedded MongoDB Shell → On this page  * Import Data into a Collection\n * Export Data from a Collection\n * Import and Export Data from

maxTimeMS for Aggregation Queries\n * Set the Documents Limit or Auto Preview Documents\n * View or Change Pipeline Settings\n * Explain Plan for Pipelines\n * Specify Custom Collation\n * Export Aggregation Results\n * Create a View from Pipeline Results\n * Refresh Document Counts\n * Example New in version 1.14.0 The Aggregation Pipeline Builder in MongoDB Compass lets you create aggregation pipelines to process documents from a collection or view and return computed results. For example, you can use aggregation pipelines to:      * Group values from multiple documents together.  * Perform operations on the grouped data to return a single result.  * Analyze data changes over time. To build an aggregation pipeline, choose a collection and click the Aggregations tab. Compass displays a blank aggregation pipeline. The Preview of Documents in the Collection section shows 20 documents randomly sampled from the chosen collection. \nNOTE \nATLAS SEARCH STAGES When you connect Compass to a MongoDB deployment hosted on Atlas, additional Atlas-only stages $search and $searchMeta are available in the Aggregation Pipeline Builder. Use these stages to perform full-text search on Atlas collections. \nTASKS \nYou can use the Compass Aggregation Pipeline Builder to:  * Create a new aggregation pipeline  * Save a pipeline  * Open a saved pipeline  * Set maxTimeMS for Aggregation Queries  * Set the documents limit or auto preview documents  * View or change pipeline settings  * View the explain plan for pipelines  * Export Aggregation Results  * Specify custom collation  * Create a view from pipeline results  * Import a pipeline from plain text  * Export a pipeline to Java, Node, C#, and Python 3  * Refresh Document Counts \nLIMITATIONS \n * The $out stage is not available if you are connected to a Data Lake.  * You cannot run the Atlas Search $search or $searchMeta stages on a time series collection. \nCREATE AN AGGREGATION PIPELINE \nAggregation pipelines can be created in two seperate modes:  * Stage View Mode, a visual click-based pipeline editor that preloads pipeline syntax based on your selected stages.  * Text View Mode, a text-based pipeline editor that accepts raw pipeline syntax. \nSTAGE VIEW MODE  \n1 TOGGLE STAGE VIEW MODE \nIn the aggregation pipeline pane, ensure the {} Stages toggle switch is selected: \n2 ADD AN AGGREGATION PIPELINE STAGE. \nIn the aggregation pipeline pane in the lower-left corner, click the Select... dropdown and select the aggregation pipeline stage to use for the first stage of the pipeline: \n3 FILL IN THE PIPELINE STAGE. \nFill in your selected stage. If you enable Preview, preview documents update automatically to the right of the stage to reflect the results of your pipeline as it progresses. You can adjust the width of the pipeline stage by dragging its border to the right. \n4 ADD ADDITIONAL PIPELINE STAGES. \nClick Add Stage to add additional aggregation stages below your last aggregation stage. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each additional stage. \nNOTE The toggle to the right of the name of each pipeline stage dictates whether that stage is included in the pipeline. Toggling a pipeline stage also updates the pipeline preview, which reflects whether or not that stage is included. The following pipeline excludes the first $match stage and only includes the $project stage: \n5 RUN THE PIPELINE. \nClick Run at the top right of the pipeline builder. Compass returns your results in the document view. \nWARNING When you click Run, the aggregation runs against the entire collection. \n6 EDIT THE PIPELINE. \nClick Edit at the top of your pipeline toolbar to return to the aggregation pipeline builder. You can make changes to your pipeline from there. \nTEXT VIEW MODE  \n1 In the aggregation pipeline pane, click the </> Text toggle switch to enable text mode for pipeline editing. \n2 Enter valid aggregation syntax in the text editor. The following example pipeline limits the query results to 4 documents. [ { \"$limit\" : 4 } ]  3 (Optional) If preview mode is enabled, you can click Output Options in the Pipeline Output pane to expand all nested fields and documents within the preview results. \n4 Click Run at the top right of the pipeline builder. Compass returns your results in the document view. \n5 (Optional) Click the Output Options dropdown and select Expand all fields to expand all nested fields and documents within the query results.

 2. Click Create a View.  3. Enter a name for your view.  4. Click Create. Compass creates a view from your pipeline results in the same database where the pipeline was created. \nREFRESH DOCUMENT COUNTS \nWhen you delete or add a document, the count results value on the Aggregations tab does not automatically update to reflect the new document count. To update the count results: 1 (Optional) If the results have not been counted, click the count results link. \n2 \nCLICK THE REFRESH BUTTON.  \nCompass updates the count results and displays the updated number of documents in the collection.  \nEXAMPLE \nIn this example, you create and run a pipeline for a collection with airline data. You can download this dataset from the following link: air_airlines.json. For instructions on importing JSON data into your cluster, see Import Data into a Collection. This example assumes you have the data in the example.air_airlines namespace. \nPROCEDURE \n 1. Connect to a database deployment. For information on how to connect to a database deployment, see Connect via Compass.  2. Select the example database where the air_airlines collection exists.  3. Create the Pipeline\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    The following pipeline has two aggregation stages: $group and $match.\n    \n    * The $group stage groups documents by their active status and country. The stage also adds a new flightCount field containing the number of documents in each group.\n    \n    * The $match stage filters documents to return documents with a flightCount value greater than or equal to 5.\n      \n        4. Run the Pipeline.\n    \n    Click Run at the top right of the pipeline builder. The pipeline returns documents, as shown in the following abbreviated example: \n←  Embedded MongoDB ShellImport Pipeline from Text → On this page  * Tasks\n * Limitations\n * Create an Aggregation

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nGENERAL CONNECTION TAB \nOn this page    \n * Procedure The General connection tab allows you to select a Connection String Scheme and configure the hostname or hosts used to connect to your MongoDB deployment. \nPROCEDURE \n1 \nCLICK ADVANCED CONNECTION OPTIONS.  2 \nCLICK THE GENERAL TAB. \n1 SELECT A CONNECTION STRING SCHEME. \nYou can select one of the following options: Connection String Scheme\nDefinition\nmongodb\nStandard Connection String Format. The standard format of the MongoDB connection URI is used to connect to a MongoDB deployment by specifying its hosts directly.\nmongodb+srv\nDNS Seed List Connection Format. The +srv indicates to MongoDB Compass that the hostname that follows corresponds to a DNS SRV record. 2 ENTER A HOSTNAME. \nIn the Host field, enter the hosts or hostname of the server where the deployment is running. If you are running your deployment locally, this value is localhost. If you are connecting to an Atlas cluster, see Connect to Database Deployment for Atlas-specific guidance on how to connect with Compass. If you are not sure of your hostname, contact your Database Administrator for information. 3 (OPTIONAL) ENABLE DIRECT CONNECTION. \nWhen you use the mongodb Connection String Scheme, you have the option to enable a Direct Connection.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nIN-USE ENCRYPTION TUTORIAL \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Requirements and Limitations\n * Create Your Encrypted Collection\n * Import Your Data\n * Enable and Disable In-Use Encryption Queryable Encryption is in Public Preview and available for evaluation purposes. Public Preview is not recommended for production deployments as breaking changes may be introduced. To learn more about the Preview please see the Queryable Encryption Preview blog post. In-Use Encryption allows you to connect to your deployments using Queryable Encryption. This connection method allows you to encrypt a subset of fields in your collections. You can also use CSFLE to encrypt a subset of fields in your collection. CSFLE encryption is enabled through the schema editor. \nOVERVIEW \nThis guide shows you how to connect to your deployment and collections using Queryable Encryption. This guide uses the air_airlines.json data set in the guided examples. The guide covers the process of importing your data set. \nREQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS \n     * In-Use Encryption is an Enterprise/Atlas only feature.  * You need a replica set to use this connection option. Your replica set can be a single node or larger.  * You need to connect to your deployment on Compass using In-Use Encryption. For more information on how to connect to your deployment, see In-Use Encryption Connection tab. \nCREATE YOUR ENCRYPTED COLLECTION \nOnce your deployment is connected using In-Use Encryption, create your collection using Queryable Encryption. You can create a new database and collection or you can create a new collection in an existing database. \nPROCEDURE \n1 Click the Create a Database button or the Create a Collection button. Enter the name of the database and/or collection. 2 CLICK THE ADVANCED COLLECTION OPTIONS DROP DOWN. \n3 CHECK THE QUERYABLE ENCRYPTION BOX. \n4 SPECIFY YOUR ENCRYPTED FIELDS. \nChange the path field value from encryptedField to the name of the field you want encrypted.  Here, the encrypted field is the base field of the air_airlines data set. For more information, see Encrypted Fields. 5 (OPTIONAL) SPECFIY KMS PROVIDER. \n6 (OPTIONAL) SPECIFY KEY ENCRYPTION KEY. \n7 CLICK CREATE DATABASE OR CREATE COLLECTION.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nPROXY / SSH TUNNEL CONNECTION TAB \nOn this page    \n * Procedure The Proxy / SSH Tunnel tab allows you to connect to your deployment using a Proxy method or SSH Tunnel. \nPROCEDURE \n1 \nCLICK ADVANCED CONNECTION OPTIONS.  2 \nCLICK THE PROXY / SSH TUNNEL TAB. \nYou have the following connection options: Option\nDescription\nSSH with Password\nConnects to a deployment using a SSH Tunnel and has the option to secure the connection with a password. For information on SSH connections and the fields for this connection option, see SSH Connection.\nSSH with Identity File\nConnects to a deployment using a SSH Tunnel and uses an Identity File to secure the connection. For information on SSH connections and the fields for this connection option, see SSH Connection.\nSocks5\nConnects to a deployment using a seperate proxy server. For more information on the fields for this connection option, see Socks5. SSH CONNECTION \nTo connect to a deployment using SSH with Password or SSH with Identity File, use the following fields: Field\nDescription\nSSH Hostname\nBastion (jumpbox) hostname. This is the unique identifier (Fully Qualified Domain Name, or FQDN) for the computer to access.\nSSH Port\nPort used for the SSH connection. This defaults to 22, the standard port for SSH.\nSSH Username\nThis is the user for which the profile to log into on the remote system. This is the user for which you want to establish the SSH connection.\nSSH Password\n(Optional) Password used to secure the SSH connection. This is required if you are not using an identity file.\nSSH Identity File File from which the identity (private key) for SSH public key authentication is read. Unix or OS X: If using OpenSSH, identity files are found in the ~/.ssh directory. By default, the private key files have one of the following file names:      * id_dsa  * id_ecdsa  * id_ed25519  * id_rsa On Windows, the location of the identity files depends on your choice of SSH client, such as PuTTY. SSH Passphrase\n(Optional) If your private key is encrypted, provide the passphrase used to decrypt your private key. A passphrase provides an extra layer of security for an SSH connection.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nSTART COMPASS FROM THE COMMAND LINE \nOn this page    \n * Compass Executable Location\n   \n * Command Line Connection Specification\n * Configuration File Connection Specification You can start a Compass session from the command line. In enterprise environments, a scripted start can make it easier to deploy Compass. For example, to limit access to sensitive systems, you can configure a command line start so that Compass can run on a jump host. There are two ways to start Compass from the command line:      * Specify a connection string on the command line  * Specify connection details in a file If your connection string contains sensitive information, consider using a configuration file to avoid exposing that information on the command line. \nCOMPASS EXECUTABLE LOCATION \nThe name and location of the Compass executable varies by operating system. \nLINUX \nThe executable is called mongodb-compass. The installer installs it in the /usr/bin directory. \nWINDOWS \nThe executable is called MongoDBCompass.exe. The installer installs it in a folder you pick during the installation process. \nMACOS \nThe executable is called MongoDB Compass. The installer installs it under the Applications folder: /Applications/MongoDB\\ Compass.app/Contents/MacOS/MongoDB\\ Compass  \nCOMMAND LINE CONNECTION SPECIFICATION \nThe command line invocation for Compass has two components, the path to the Compass executable and a connection string. You can optionally provide the username and password on the command line or the configuration file. The format is:  <path/to/compass/executable> <connection string> --username <username> --password <password> \nNOTE If the username and password arguments are not provided, Compass uses the credentials in the connection string. \nBASIC CONNECTION STRING \nThe following example uses a basic connection string for a MongoDB University training cluster. Modify the connection details to connect to your MongoDB installation: mongodb-compass mongodb+srv://cluster0.xxxxxx.mongodb.net/library  \nUSERNAME AND PASSWORD PARAMETERS \nThis example uses the username and password parameters to authenticate Compass to the MongoDB deployment provided in the connection string: mongodb-compass mongodb+srv://cluster0.xxxxxx.mongodb.net/library--username user1 --password password1  \nCONFIGURATION FILE CONNECTION SPECIFICATION \nThe command line invocation for Compass can specify a configuration file. The format is: <path/to/compass/executable> \\   --file=<filename> \\   [--passphrase=<passphrase>] \\   [<connection id>]  The components of the command invocation are:  * The path to the Compass executable  * A connection configuration file  * An optional passphrase for the connection configuration file  * An optional connection id To create the connection configuration file, follow the steps to export the connection details from your Compass instance. The export process creates a file that includes all of your favorite connections. \nIMPORTANT If you export your saved connections without using a passphrase, the configuration file contains the plaintext version of your username and password. Use a passphrase to encrypt the password. To open Compass and connect to your MongoDB instance, use a command line like: mongodb-compass --file=learningConnectionFile \\                --passphrase=superSecret If you have multiple favorites, include the connection id from the configuration file to specify which connection to use: mongodb-compass --file=multipleConnectionFile \\                --passphrase=superSecret \\

To enable TLS and add a client certificate, see the TLS / SSL tab in Compass. KERBEROS \nSelect Kerberos if the deployment uses Kerberos as its authentication mechanism. Provide the following information: Field\nDescription\nPrincipal\nEvery participant in the authenticated communication is known as a \"principal\", and every principal must have a unique name.\n(Optional) Service Name\nEvery MongoDB mongod and mongos instance (or exe or exe on Windows) must have an associated service name. The default is mongodb.\n(Optional) Canonicalize Host Name\nKerberos uses the canonicalized form of the host name (cname) when constructing the principal for MongoDB Compass.\n(Optional) Service Realm The service realm is the domain over which a Kerberos authentication server has the authority to authenticate a user. If you choose to Canonicalize Host Name, you can specify one of the following options: Option\nDescription\nForward\nThe driver does a cname lookup on the kerberos hostname.\nForward and Reverse\nPerforms a forward DNS lookup and then a reverse lookup on that value to canonicalize the hostname. For more information on principal name canonicalization in Kerberos, see this RFC document. (Optional) Provide password directly\nUsed to verify your identity. AUTHENTICATE AS A DIFFERENT KERBEROS USER ON WINDOWS \nWhen you authenticate with Kerberos on Windows, the Principal you specify must match the principal of the security context that Compass is running. Normally, this is the logged-in user who is running Compass. To authenticate as a different Kerberos user, run MongoDB Compass as the chosen user and specify the Principal for that user. To run MongoDB Compass as a different user, either:  * Hold Shift and right-click the MongoDB Compass program icon to select Run as a different user.  * Use the runas command-line tool. For example, the following command runs MongoDB Compass as a user named admin:\n   \n   runas /profile /user:mymachine\\admin <path to MongoDB Compass>\n   \n    After you start MongoDB Compass as the chosen user, to authenticate against your Kerberos-enabled MongoDB deployment, specify the Principal for the corresponding user. LDAP \nSelect LDAP if the deployment uses LDAP as its authentication mechanism. Provide the following information:  * Username  * Password AWS IAM \nSelect AWS IAM if the deployment uses AWS IAM as its authentication mechanism. The following fields are optional as they can be defined on your platform using their respective AWS IAM environment variables. MongoDB Compass will use these environment variable values to authenticate; you do not need to specify them in the connection string.  * (Optional) AWS Access Key Id  * (Optional) AWS Secret Access

from the initial connect screen, or after you have successfully connected to a MongoDB deployment. \nSAVE FROM CONNECT SCREEN \n1 CONFIGURE YOUR CONNECTION FORM WITH A CONNECTION YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAVE. \n2 CLICK FAVORITE AT THE TOP OF THE FORM.  3 ENTER A NAME FOR THIS FAVORITE CONNECTION.  4 (OPTIONAL) SELECT A COLOR FOR YOUR FAVORITE TO MORE EASILY IDENTIFY THE FAVORITE CONNECTION. \n5 CLICK

EDIT A FAVORITE CONNECTION \n1 \nCLICK THE DESIRED CONNECTION UNDER FAVORITES IN THE LEFT NAVIGATION PANEL.  \nTo Copy or Remove a Favorite Connection, hover over the target connection and click the button.      * Copying a connection creates another Favorite Connection with the same configuration.  * Removing a connection deletes that Favorite Connection. 2 \nMAKE THE DESIRED CHANGES TO THE CONNECTION CONFIGURATION WITHIN THE FORM. \nWhen you make any change to a connection, a dialog will appear at the bottom of the form with options Discard and Save Changes. 3 \nCLICK SAVE CHANGES.  DELETE A FAVORITE CONNECTION \n1 \nCLICK THE DESIRED CONNECTION UNDER FAVORITES IN THE LEFT NAVIGATION PANEL. \n2 \nCLICK THE BUTTON ON THE CONNECTION.  \nCompass displays a dropdown menu with options Copy and Remove. 3 \nCLICK REMOVE FROM THE DROPDOWN MENU. \nCompass removes the connection from the Favorites list and returns the New Connection form to the default state. \nCONSIDERATIONS \n * On macOS systems, the first time that you update MongoDB Compass to version 1.20 or later, you will need to allow access to your system storage for each saved connection in Recents and Favorites. To learn more, see Allow Keychain Access for Recent and Favorite Connections.  * If you run MongoDB Compass on KDE Linux, you must have GNOME Keyring installed to successfully load saved connections.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nEXPORT SAVED CONNECTIONS WITH THE CLI \nOn this page    \n * About This Task\n   \n * Export Encrypted Saved Connections\n * Procedure\n * Example\n * Export Unencrypted Saved Connections\n * Procedure\n * Example\n * Next Steps You can use the Compass CLI to export saved connections. Colleagues can import your saved connections, or you can use them yourself in your other workspaces. \nABOUT THIS TASK \nWhen you export saved connections, Compass exports the list of connections as a JSON file. By default, when you export saved connections, passwords are included in plaintext. To protect sensitive connection information, encrypt the exported file with a passphrase. \nEXPORT ENCRYPTED SAVED CONNECTIONS \nThis section shows how to export encrypted saved connections. When you encrypt the export file, users must specify the matching passphrase to import the connections. \nPROCEDURE \nTo export encrypted saved connections with the Compass CLI, specify:      * The path to the MongoDB Compass executable. The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating system.  * The --export-connections option set to the destination of the output file.  * The --passphrase option set to a passphrase used to encrypt the output file. Your operation should resemble the following prototype: <path-to-Compass-executable> \\--export-connections=<filename> \\--passphrase=<passphrase>  \nEXAMPLE \nThis example exports saved Compass connections to a file with the path /tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json. The exported file is encrypted with the passphrase abc123. Run the following command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass executable: ./MongoDB\\ Compass \\--export-connections=/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json \\--passphrase=abc123  \nNOTE The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating system. The preceding command is for macOS.

 Sensitive connection information is encrypted in the connectionSecrets field. \nEXPORT UNENCRYPTED SAVED CONNECTIONS \nThis section shows how to export unencrypted saved connections. If you do not encrypt the export file, database usernames and passwords are exported in plaintext. Only export unencrypted connections if no other users will have access to the exported file. \nPROCEDURE \nTo export encrypted saved connections with the Compass CLI, specify:  * The path to the MongoDB Compass executable. The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating system.  * The --export-connections option set to the destination of the output file. Your operation should resemble the following prototype: <path-to-Compass-executable> \\--export-connections=<filename>  \nEXAMPLE \nThis example exports saved Compass connections to a file with the path /tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json. Run the following command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass executable: ./MongoDB\\ Compass \\--export-connections=/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json  \nNOTE The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating system. The preceding command is for macOS. You will see this output: Exporting connections to \"/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json\" (without passphrase) RESULTS \nAfter the export completes, the /tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json file resembles the following: {  \"type\": \"Compass Connections\",  \"version\": {    \"$numberInt\": \"1\"  },  \"connections\": [    {      \"id\": \"5a92e195-3ef5-49ae-aff6-720af362770d\",

connections in MongoDB Compass. Colleagues can import your saved connections, or you can use them in your other workspaces. \nABOUT THIS TASK \nWhen you export saved connections, Compass exports the list of connections as a JSON file. By default, when you export saved connections, passwords are included in plaintext. To protect sensitive connection information, encrypt the exported file with a passphrase. \nPROCEDURE \nTo export encrypted saved connections with Compass: 1 On the Connect screen, hover over Saved Connections in the left-side navigation and click the Ellipses (...) button. 2 \nSELECT EXPORT SAVED CONNECTIONS. \n3 In the Export saved connections dialog box, select the connection names you want to export. 4 Under Target File, click Select a file... to specify the output file destination. 5 Optional. Toggle Remove secrets to omit passwords, access tokens, and other sensitive information from the exported file. If you select Remove secrets, you cannot specify an encryption password. 6 Optional. Specify an Encryption Password to encrypt passwords, access tokens, and other sensitive information. If you do not encrypt the export file, passwords are exported in plaintext. Only export unencrypted connections if no other users will have access to the exported file. 7 Click Export to export your saved connections to a JSON file. \nNEXT STEPS \nTo learn how to import saved

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nIMPORT SAVED CONNECTIONS WITH THE CLI \nOn this page    \n * Prerequisite\n   \n * Import Encrypted Saved Connections\n * Procedure\n * Example\n * Errors\n * Import Unencrypted Saved Connections\n * Procedure\n * Example You can use the Compass CLI to import saved connections. This lets you use saved connections from other workspaces or connections used by other team members. \nPREREQUISITE \nTo import saved connections, you must first export the connections. \nIMPORT ENCRYPTED SAVED CONNECTIONS \nUse this procedure to import a list of saved connections that is encrypted with a passphrase. \nPROCEDURE \nTo import unencrypted saved connections with the Compass CLI, specify:      * The path to the MongoDB Compass executable. The name and filepath of the executable depend on your operating system.  * The --import-connections option set to the destination of the file containing saved connections.  * The --passphrase option set to the passphrase used to encrypt the exported file. Your operation should resemble the following prototype: <path-to-Compass-executable> \\--import-connections=<filename> \\--passphrase=<passphrase>  \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example imports saved Compass connections from a file with the path /tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json that is encrypted with the passphrase abc123. Run the following command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass executable: ./MongoDB\\ Compass \\--import-connections=/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json \\--passphrase=abc123  \nNOTE The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating system. The preceding command is for macOS. RESULTS \nAfter you run the import command, you will see this output: Importing connections from \"/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json\" (with passphrase) MongoDB Compass starts and you will see the imported connections under Saved Connections on the Connect screen. \nERRORS \nWhen you try to import encrypted saved connections, you may see these errors:  * If do not specify a passphrase, you will see this error:\n   \n   Failed to perform operation Be [Error]: Input file contains encryptedsecrets but no passphrase was provided  * If you specify an incorrect passphrase, you will see this error:\n   \n   Failed to perform operation Be [Error]: Cannot decrypt due to corruptdata or wrong passphrase \nIMPORT UNENCRYPTED SAVED CONNECTIONS \nUse this procedure to import a list of saved connections that is not encrypted with a passphrase. \nPROCEDURE \nTo import unencrypted saved connections with the Compass CLI, specify:  * The path to the MongoDB Compass executable.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nBLOCK OUTGOING NETWORK CONNECTIONS \nOn this page    \n * Consideration\n   \n * Procedure\n * Command Line Example\n * Configuration File Example\n * Learn More You can configure MongoDB Compass to not perform outgoing network operations other than those to the database. This lets you configure any edition of Compass to restrict outgoing connections in the same way Compass Isolated Edition restricts connections. \nCONSIDERATION \nWhen you block outgoing network connections, Compass can't use third-party mapping services in schema visualizations. \nPROCEDURE \nTo block outgoing network operations, disable the networkTraffic configuration option. You can set configuration options in either a command line option or configuration file option. \nCOMMAND LINE EXAMPLE \nThe following command starts MongoDB Compass from the command line and sets the --no-networkTraffic option: <path-to-Compass-executable> --no-networkTraffic  \nNOTE The name and filepath of the Compass executable depend on your operating system. \nCONFIGURATION FILE EXAMPLE \nYou can specify the Compass configuration file in either EJSON or YAML format. The following configurations set the networkTraffic option to false: EJSON \n{ \"networkTraffic\": false }  YAML \nnetworkTraffic: false  \nLEARN MORE \nTo learn more about the MongoDB Compass

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nEXPORT YOUR SCHEMA \nOn this page    \n * Schema Object Properties\n   \n * Example Schema You can export your schema after analyzing it. This is useful for sharing your schema and comparing schemas across collections. If you have not already done so, analyze your schema:       1. Select your desired collection and click the Schema tab.  2. Click Analyze Schema. \nNOTE When Compass analyzes your schema, it samples a random subset of documents from your collection. To learn more about sampling, see Sampling. Once your schema has been analyzed, export your schema:  1. In the top menu bar, click Collection.  2. From the dropdown, click Share Schema as JSON.  Your schema is copied to your clipboard as a JSON object. \nSCHEMA OBJECT PROPERTIES \nSchema objects have count and fields properties:  * count is an integer that represents the number of documents sampled from the collection to generate the schema.  * fields is an array of metadata objects that correspond to each field in the documents analyzed during sampling. Each element in the fields array contains the following fields: Property\nData type\nDescription\nname\nString\nName of the corresponding field, e.g. _id.\npath\nString\nPath to the corresponding field within a document.\ncount\nInteger\nNumber of documents in which the corresponding field appears.\ntypes\nArray\nArray of metadata objects that represent each data type that appears in the corresponding field.\ntypes[n].name\nString\nName of this data type.\ntypes[n].bsonType\nString\nBSON type of this data type.\ntypes[n].path\nString\nPath to the corresponding field within a document.\ntypes[n].count\nInteger\nNumber of times this data type appears in the corresponding field.\ntypes[n].values\nArray\nArray of the actual sampled values that appear in the corresponding field and match this data type.\ntypes[n].total_count\nInteger\nIf the corresponding field is an array, the number of elements in that array.\ntypes[n].probability\nNumber\nProbability that the value of the corresponding field is this data type in a random document.\ntypes[n].unique\nInteger\nNumber of unique values of this data type that appear in the corresponding field.\ntypes[n].has_duplicates\nBoolean\ntrue if a single value of this data type appears multiple times in the corresponding field. Otherwise false.\ntypes[n].lengths\nArray\nIf this data type is an array, an array of integers representing the lengths of arrays found in the corresponding field. Not present for other data types.\ntypes[n].average_length\nNumber\nIf this data type is an array, the average length of arrays in the corresponding field across sampled documents. Not present for other data types.\ntotal_count\nInteger\nNumber of documents sampled from the collection.\ntype\nString or Array\nString or array of strings representing possible types for the corresponding field.\nhas_duplicates\nBoolean\ntrue if a single value appears multiple times in the corresponding field. Otherwise false.\nprobability\nNumber\nProbability that a random document contains the corresponding field. \nEXAMPLE SCHEMA \nThe following example uses a collection of 3 documents, each with a sport field and unique information about that sport: 1[2  {3    \"_id\": { \"$oid\":\"5e8359ba7782b98ba98c16fd\" },4    \"sport\": \"Baseball\",5    \"equipment\": [ \"bat\", \"baseball\", \"glove\", \"helmet\" ]6  },7  {8    \"_id\": { \"$oid\":\"5e835a727782b98ba98c16fe\" },9    \"sport\": \"Football\",10    \"variants\": {11        \"us\":\"Soccer\",12        \"eu\":\"Football\"13    }14  },15  {16    \"_id\": { \"$oid\":\"5e835ade7782b98ba98c16ff\" },17    \"sport\": \"Cricket\",18    \"origin\": \"England\"19  }20]  You can import the above example to MongoDB Compass to experiment with schema outputs.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nADJUST MAXIMUM TIME FOR QUERY OPERATIONS \nThe MAX TIME MS query bar option sets the cumulative time limit in milliseconds to process query bar operations. If the time limit is reached before the operation completes, Compass interrupts the operation.  The default MAX TIME MS value is 60000, or 60 seconds. Consider raising this value if you have a very large collection, or your operations are frequently timing out. You can also consider creating indexes to improve query performance. \nSET MAX TIME MS \n      1. Click Options.  2.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nSET WHICH FIELDS ARE RETURNED \nIf the query bar displays the Project option, you can specify which fields to return in the resulting data. By default, all fields are returned. To set a projection:       1. In the Query Bar, click Options.  2. Enter the projection document into the Project field.\n    \n    To include fields:\n    \n    Specify the field name and set to 1 in the project document.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    { year: 1, name: 1 }\n    \n    \n    \n    Only the fields specified in the project document are returned. The _id field is returned unless it is set to 0 in the Project document.\n    \n    To exclude fields:\n    \n    Specify the field name and set to 0 in the project document.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    { year: 0, name: 0 }\n    \n    \n    \n    All fields except for the fields specified in the project document are returned.\n    \n    As you type, the Find button is disabled and the Project label turns red until a valid query is entered.  3. Click Find to run the query and view the updated results.\n    \n    \n    NOTE\n    \n    For query result sets larger than 1000 documents, Compass shows a sampling of the results. Otherwise, Compass shows the entire result set.\n    \n    For details on sampling, see Sampling. \nTO LEARN MORE \nTo learn how project works, see the project entry in the MongoDB Manual. \nHOW DOES THE COMPASS QUERY COMPARE TO MONGODB AND SQL QUERIES? \n$project corresponds to choosing specific fields to return in a SQL SELECT statement. \nEXAMPLE You have 3,235 articles. You would like to see only the headlines and authors of those articles.

Clustered collections store documents ordered by clustered index key value. You can use clustered collections when only one clustered index is necessary. \nRESTRICTIONS \nClustered collection limitations:      * The clustered index key must be on the _id field.  * Clustered collections may not be capped collections. \nSTEPS \n1 \nOPEN THE CREATE COLLECTION DIALOG BOX. \nSelect a database and from the Collections screen, click the Create Collection button. You can also click the + next to the name of the database you select to open the Create Collection dialog box. \n2 \nENTER THE COLLECTION NAME. \n3 \nSELECT THE TYPE OF COLLECTION YOU WANT TO CREATE. \nFrom the Advanced Collection Options drop-down, select Clustered Collections. 4 \n(OPTIONAL) NAME YOUR CLUSTERED INDEX. \nYou can enter a name for the clustered index or use the automatically generated name. 5 \n(OPTIONAL) ENTER THE NUMBER OF SECONDS FOR THE EXPIREAFTERSECONDS FIELD. \nThe expireAfterSeconds field is a TTL index that enables automatic deletion of documents older than the specified number of seconds. The expireAfterSeconds field must be a positive, non-zero value. 6 \nCLICK CREATE COLLECTION TO CREATE YOUR NEW COLLECTION. \nIn the Collections screen, your new collection is marked by a Clustered

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nQUERY YOUR DATA \nOn this page    \n * Set Query Filter\n   \n * Supported Data Types in the Query Bar\n * Clear the Query\n * How Does the Compass Query Compare to MongoDB and SQL Queries?\n * Examples You can type MongoDB filter documents into the query bar to display only documents which match the specified criteria. To learn more about querying documents, see Query Documents in the MongoDB manual. \nSET QUERY FILTER \n      1. In the Filter field, enter a filter document. You can use all of the MongoDB query operators except the $text and $expr operators.\n    \n    \n    EXAMPLE\n    \n    The following filter only returns documents which have a title value of Jurassic Park:\n    \n    { \"title\": \"Jurassic Park\" }\n    \n      2. Click Find to run the query and view the updated results.\n    \n    click to enlarge \nNOTE For query result sets larger than 1000 documents, Compass shows a sampling of the results. Otherwise, Compass shows the entire result set. For details on sampling, see Sampling. \nSUPPORTED DATA TYPES IN THE QUERY BAR \nThe Compass Filter supports using the mongo shell mode representation of the MongoDB Extended JSON BSON data types. \nEXAMPLE The following filter returns documents where start_date is greater than than the BSON Date 2017-05-01: { \"start_date\": {$gt: new Date('2017-05-01')} }  By specifying the Date type in both start_date and the $gt comparison operator, Compass performs the greater than comparison chronologically, returning documents with start_date later than 2017-05-01. Without the Date type specification, Compass compares the start_dates as strings lexicographically, instead of comparing the values chronologically. \nCLEAR THE QUERY \nTo clear the query bar and the results of the query, click Reset. \nHOW DOES THE COMPASS QUERY COMPARE TO MONGODB AND SQL QUERIES? \n$filter corresponds to the WHERE clause in a SQL SELECT statement. \nEXAMPLE You have 3,235 articles. You would like to see all articles that Joe Bloggs wrote. Compass Filter Option { author : { $eq : \"Joe Bloggs\" } } \nMongoDB Aggregation db.article.aggregate(  { $filter : { author : { $eq : \"Joe Bloggs\" } } }); \nSQL SELECT * FROM articleWHERE author = \"Joe Bloggs\";  \nEXAMPLES  EXAMPLE The following examples use the JSON documents below as sample data. To import this sample data to your MongoDB deployment with MongoDB Compass:  1. Copy the array of documents below by clicking Copy.

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nCREATE A COLLECTION WITH COLLATION \nOn this page    \n * Procedure\n   \n * Restrictions and Limitations Collation allows you to specify language-specific rules for string comparison, such as rules for lettercase and accent marks. \nPROCEDURE \n1 \nCLICK THE CREATE COLLECTION BUTTON. \nFrom the Collections screen, click the Create Collection button. 2 \nENTER THE COLLECTION NAME. \n3 \nCLICK THE ADVANCED COLLECTION OPTIONS DROPDOWN. \nCheck the Use Custom Collaton option. 4 \nSELECT A VALUE FOR LOCALE. \nYou are required to select a locale from the MongoDB supported languages. All other collation options parameters are optional. For descriptions of the fields, see Collation. 5 \nCLICK CREATE COLLECTION TO CREATE THE COLLECTION.  RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS \nThe following restrictions apply when the parameter numericOrdering is set to true:      * Only contiguous non-negative integer substrings of digits are considered in the comparisons. numericOrdering does not support:\n   \n   * +\n   \n   * -\n   \n   * exponents  * Only Unicode code points in the Number or Decimal Digit (Nd) category are treated as digits.  * If the number length exceeds 254 characters, the excess characters are treated as a separate number. \nEXAMPLE \nConsider a collection with the following string number and decimal values: [  { \"n\": \"1\" },  { \"n\": \"2\" },  { \"n\": \"-2.1\" },  { \"n\": \"2.0\" },  { \"n\": \"2.20\" },  { \"n\": \"10\"},  { \"n\": \"20\" },  { \"n\": \"20.1\" },  { \"n\": \"-10\" },  { \"n\": \"3\" }]  The following find query uses a collation document containing the numericOrdering parameter:  db.c.find(  { }, { _id: 0 } ).sort(   { n: 1 }  ).collation( {   locale: 'en_US',   numericOrdering: true} )  For more information on querying documents in Compass, see Query Your Data. The operations returns the following results: [   { \"n\": \"-2.1\" },   { \"n\": \"-10\" },   { \"n\": \"1\" },   { \"n\": \"2\" },   { \"n\": \"2.0\" }   { \"n\": \"2.20\" },   { \"n\": \"3\" },   { \"n\": \"10\" },   { \"n\": \"20\" },   {\"n\": \"20.1\" }]   * numericOrdering: true sorts the string values in ascending order as if they were numeric values.  * The two negative values -2.1 and -10 are not sorted in the expected sort order because they have unsupported - characters. ←  Create a Capped CollectionCreate a Clustered Collection → On this page  * Procedure\n * Restrictions and

Docs Home → MongoDB Compass \nCOMPASS CONNECTION ERRORS \nOn this page    \n * MongoDB Not Running on the Provided Host and Port\n   \n * Insert Document Button Disabled and Cannot Modify Documents\n * Connection to Cluster Shard Closed\n * Not Master or Secondary is Not Writable\n * Authentication Failed\n * Check the Compass Logs\n * Additional Resources The sections on this page list common errors seen when connecting to MongoDB Compass and provide possible solutions. \nMONGODB NOT RUNNING ON THE PROVIDED HOST AND PORT \nYour connection failed when Compass attempted to connect to your database on the specified host and port. \nLIKELY CAUSES \nThis error often occurs when:      * You provide no hostname or an invalid hostname to the Compass connect dialog.  * The destination server rejects a connection on an incorrect port.  * Your MongoDB cluster or server has been shutdown or the server hostname has changed.  * You have a firewall actively blocking connections to/from your local network. \nSOLUTIONS \nThe solution to this issue may depend on how your MongoDB environment is configured. Select the appropriate tab for your MongoDB environment to view possible solutions:   INSERT DOCUMENT BUTTON DISABLED AND CANNOT MODIFY DOCUMENTS \nWhen using Compass, you may be in a state where you cannot perform any write operations, and can only read data. \nPOSSIBLE OBSERVATIONS \nWhen you are in this state:  * The Create Collection and Insert Document buttons are disabled.  * You cannot modify any of your documents. \nLIKELY CAUSE \nThere are two likely causes for this behavior:  * You are connected to a secondary member of your cluster, which does not support write operations.  * You are using Compass Readonly edition, which does not support write operations. \nSOLUTIONS \nCHECK READ PREFERENCE SETTING \nIn the Compass connection dialog, set your Read Preference to Primary. This will ensure that you connect to your cluster's primary member, which supports write operations. CHECK REPLICA SET NAME \nCheck that your Replica Set Name is accurate. Compass is only able to identify the primary correctly if the replica set name is accurate. If your cluster is hosted in Atlas, you can obtain the correct replica set name using the following procedure:  1. Navigate to your Atlas Clusters view.  2. Click Connect for your desired cluster.  3. Click Connect with MongoDB Compass.  4. Copy the provided connection string.  5. Open MongoDB Compass.  6. Click Yes to auto-fill the connection settings.\n    \n     CHECK YOUR COMPASS EDITION \nYou cannot perform write operations in Compass Readonly edition.

 1. Navigate to your Atlas Clusters view.  2. Click Connect for your desired cluster.  3. Click Connect with MongoDB Compass.  4. Copy the provided connection string.  5. Open MongoDB Compass.  6. Click Yes to auto-fill the connection settings.\n    \n     ALLOW COMPASS TO CONNECT TO THE SECONDARY \nAnother approach to resolving this error is to allow Compass to connect to a secondary cluster member. Change your Read Preference to either Primary Preferred or Secondary Preferred in your connection settings. This should allow you to bypass this error and connect. \nNOTE When you connect to a secondary cluster member, you cannot create or modify documents, indexes, or databases. Only use this solution when you do not need to perform any write operations. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: For more information on read preferences, see Read Preference in the MongoDB manual. \nAUTHENTICATION FAILED \nWhen you attempt to connect to your cluster using Compass, you may encounter an error message stating Authentication Failed. \nLIKELY CAUSES \nThis error message is often the result of one of five conditions:  * Your Password is missing after autofilling your connection details from a copied connection string. Compass requires you to manually enter your password in the connection dialog as a security precaution.  * Your Username and/or Password are incorrect.  * You have not configured any MongoDB users for your Atlas cluster.  * You did not select the correct Authentication method.  * You did not specify the correct Authentication Database. This setting corresponds to the authSource connection string option.\n   \n   \n   NOTE\n   \n   For Atlas clusters, the Authentication Database is usually admin. \nSOLUTIONS \n * Ensure you provided the correct Username and Password.  * Ensure that the MongoDB user you are authenticating as exists.  * Verify your Authentication Database and authentication mechanism.  * Verify that your selected authentication mechanism is supported by your MongoDB database. \nCHECK THE COMPASS LOGS \nThe Compass logs can provide additional information on connection errors. You may find more detailed error messages to help diagnose your issue. For more information, see Retrieve Compass Logs. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES \n * Connect to Atlas via Compass  * Troubleshoot Atlas Connections ←  Retrieve Compass LogsFAQ → On this page  * MongoDB Not

over a period of time. \nPROCEDURE \n1 \nCLICK THE CREATE COLLECTION BUTTON. \nFrom the Collections screen, click the Create Collection button. 2 \nENTER THE COLLECTION NAME. \n3 \nCLICK THE ADVANCED COLLECTION OPTIONS DROPDOWN. \nCheck the Time Series Collection option. 4 \nSPECIFY A TIMEFIELD. \nSpecify which field should be used as the timeField for the time-series collection. This field must have a BSON type date. The following fields are optional: Field\nType\nDescription\nmetaField\nstring\nThe name of the field that contains metadata in each time series document. The metadata in the specified field should be data that is used to label a unique series of documents.\ngranularity\nstring Specifies a coarser granularity so measurements over a longer time span can be more efficiently stored and queried. The default value is \"seconds\". If you set the granularity parameter, you can't set the bucketMaxSpanSeconds and bucketRoundingSeconds parameters. expireAfterSeconds\nnumber\nEnables the automatic deletion of documents that are older than the specified number of seconds.\nbucketMaxSpanSeconds\nnumber Specifies the maximum time span between measurements in a bucket. The value of bucketMaxSpanSeconds must be the same as bucketRoundingSeconds. If you set the bucketMaxSpanSeconds, parameter, you can't set the granularity parameter. bucketRoundingSeconds\nnumber Specifies the time interval that determines the starting timestamp for a new bucket. The value of bucketRoundingSeconds must be the same as bucketMaxSpanSeconds. If you set the bucketRoundingSeconds, parameter, you can't set the granularity parameter. For more information on time series fields, see Time Series Object Fields. 5 \nCLICK CREATE COLLECTION TO CREATE THE COLLECTION. \nYour collection will be marked by a time series badge. On the left-hand navigation bar your time series collection will have the following icon:  \nRESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS \nThe following restrictions and limitations apply when creating a time series
