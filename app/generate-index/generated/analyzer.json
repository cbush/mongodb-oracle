Install the MongoDB Analyzer as described in the installation guide.  2. Create a file specifying your configuration for the MongoDB Analyzer named mongodb.analyzer.json.\n    \n    \n    IMPORTANT\n    \n    \n    NAMING\n    \n    You must name your configuration file mongodb.analyzer.json.  3. Add your configuration to your mongodb.analyzer.json file.\n    \n    The following sample configuration makes the MongoDB Analyzer use the LINQ3 provider.\n    \n    { \"DefaultLinqVersion\": \"V3\" }\n    \n      4. Add the following to the .csproj file for your .NET application within the Project tag:\n    \n    <ItemGroup>  <AdditionalFiles Include=\"<path to your mongodb.analyzer.json file>\" /></ItemGroup>\n    \n     \nNOTE \nCONFIGURATION IS OPTIONAL If you do not specify a configuration file, the MongoDB Analyzer uses the default value for all configuration options. To learn more about .NET project files, see Understanding the Project File from Microsoft. To learn more about the AdditionalFiles tag, see Using Additional Files in the Roslyn documentation. \nOPTIONS \nThe following is a description of all configuration options supported by the MongoDB Analyzer: Name\nDescription\nDefaultLinqVersion\nType: string \nDescription:\nThe LINQ provider the MongoDB Analyzer uses. \nTIP To learn more about LINQ, see the Analyze Your Code page. Default: \"V2\"\nAccepted Values: \"V2\" or \"V3\"\nEnableVariableTracking\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nSpecifies if the MongoDB Analyzer tracks and composes builder expression variables. \nTIP To learn more about builder expressions, see the Analyze Your Code page. Default: true\nAccepted Values: true or false\nOutputDriverVersion\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nSpecifies if the MongoDB Analyzer includes your .NET driver version in diagnostic messages. \nDefault: false\nAccepted Values: true or false\nOutputInternalExceptions\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nSpecifies if the MongoDB Analyzer includes internal exceptions in diagnostic messages. \nDefault: false\nAccepted Values: true or false\nOutputInternalLogsToFile\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nSpecifies if the MongoDB Analyzer writes its internal logs to a file. \nIMPORTANT To output logs, you must specify both a logfile and the OutputInternalLogsToFile option. Use the following sample configuration to make the MongoDB Analyzer output information to a logfile: \"OutputInternalLogsToFile\": true,\"LogFileName\": \"<path to your logfile>\" \nDefault: false\nAccepted Values: true or false\nLogFileName\nType: string \nDescription:\nSpecifies the path to which the MongoDB Analyzer writes its internal logs. \nIMPORTANT To output logs, you must specify both a logfile and the OutputInternalLogsToFile option. Use the following sample configuration to make the MongoDB Analyzer output information to a logfile: \"OutputInternalLogsToFile\": true,\"LogFileName\": \"<path to your logfile>\" \nDefault: \"\"\nAccepted Values: A valid file path\nSendTelemetry\nType: boolean \nDescription:\nSpecifies if the MongoDB Analyzer collects and sends anonymized information to MongoDB Inc. to improve products. \nTIP To learn more about telemetry in the MongoDB Analyzer, see the Telemetry section of this guide. Default: true\nAccepted Values: true or false To learn more about the configuration options the MongoDB Analyzer supports, see the MongoDB Analyzer source code. \nTELEMETRY \nWhen the MongoDB Analyzer analyzes your source code, the tool by default collects and sends anonymized information to MongoDB Inc. to improve products.
