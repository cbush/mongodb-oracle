Expressions\n * Track Builder Variables\n * Fluent API \nOVERVIEW \nA builder is a class provided by the .NET driver to help you construct common operations like queries and updates. To learn more about builders, see Operations with Builders in the .NET driver documentation. \nTRANSLATE INTO THE MONGODB QUERY API \nUse the MongoDB Analyzer to translate your builder expressions into the MongoDB Query API. Click the following tabs to see an example of a builder expression and its corresponding MongoDB Query API translation:   NOTE \nVARIABLE NAMES The MongoDB Query API translations generated by the MongoDB Analyzer contain variable names from your .NET driver code. The .NET driver replaces these variable names with their corresponding values when your application communicates with MongoDB. \nANALYZE BUILDERS IN VISUAL STUDIO \nTo analyze your builder expressions in Visual Studio, perform the following actions:       1. Install the MongoDB Analyzer as described in the Install guide.  2. Write a builder expression with the .NET driver  3. Move your mouse over the ... annotation beneath the first method of your builder expression to display an information message that contains the MongoDB Query API translation. \nSIMPLE BUILDER EXPRESSIONS \nClick on the following corresponding tab to see a builder expression with or without an information message displayed:   TRACK BUILDER VARIABLES \nThe MongoDB Analyzer supports builder variable tracking and composition. You can combine multiple builder expressions with logical operators and view the MongoDB Query API translation in the information message. Click on the following corresponding tab to see a composed builder variable with or without an information message displayed:   FLUENT API \nThe MongoDB Analyzer supports the Fluent API using builder classes in the .NET driver. You can create a sequence of chained builder methods and view the MongoDB Query API translation in the information message. Click on the following corresponding tab to see an operation using chained builder methods with or without an information message displayed:   TIP \nERROR LIST PANEL If you are using Visual Studio for Windows, you can view the output from the MongoDB Analyzer in the Error List window.

Docs Home → MongoDB Analyzer \nANALYZE LINQ EXPRESSIONS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Translate into the MongoDB Query API\n * Analyze LINQ in Visual Studio\n * Simple LINQ Expressions\n * Unsupported LINQ Expressions\n * Analyze LINQ3 \nOVERVIEW \nLINQ is a query syntax included in the C# language. The .NET driver can translate a subset of LINQ expressions into MongoDB aggregation pipelines. To learn more about LINQ, see the following resources:      * LINQ in the .NET driver documentation  * LINQ in the Microsoft C# guide To learn more about aggregation pipelines, see Aggregation in the MongoDB manual. \nNOTE \nRUNTIME DIFFERENCES Although the MongoDB Query API translations generated by the MongoDB Analyzer have the same query shape as your runtime .NET driver queries, there may be slight differences due to the following factors:  * Your Serialization Settings  * Your LINQ Settings The difference between the translations the MongoDB Analyzer generates and your queries at runtime should not impact your ability to analyze and debug your code. To learn more about serialization and LINQ settings, see the FAQ page. Use the MongoDB Analyzer to learn the following about your LINQ expressions:  * How your LINQ expressions translate into the MongoDB Query API  * If any of your LINQ expressions are not supported \nTRANSLATE INTO THE MONGODB QUERY API \nClick the following tabs to see an example of a LINQ expression and its corresponding MongoDB Query API translation:   NOTE \nVARIABLE NAMES The MongoDB Query API translations generated by the MongoDB Analyzer contain variable names from your .NET driver code. The .NET driver replaces these variable names with their corresponding values when your application communicates with MongoDB. \nANALYZE LINQ IN VISUAL STUDIO \nTo analyze your LINQ expressions in Visual Studio, perform the following actions:  1. Install the MongoDB Analyzer as described in the Install guide.  2. Write a LINQ expression with the .NET driver.  3. Move your mouse over the ... annotation beneath the first method of your LINQ expression to display an information message that contains the MongoDB Query API translation. \nSIMPLE LINQ EXPRESSIONS \nThe MongoDB Analyzer analyzes LINQ expressions in the following syntax types:  * Method syntax  * Query syntax Click on the following corresponding tab to see a LINQ expression written in method syntax with or without an information message displayed:  \nClick on the following corresponding tab to see a LINQ expression written in query syntax with or without an information message displayed:   UNSUPPORTED LINQ EXPRESSIONS \nIf your LINQ expression is not supported, the MongoDB Analyzer outputs a NotSupportedLinqExpression warning. Click the following tabs to see a code snippet containing an unsupported LINQ expression and the corresponding warning message displayed by the MongoDB Analyzer:   TIP \nERROR LIST PANEL If you are using Visual Studio for Windows, you can view the output from the MongoDB Analyzer in the Error List window. To learn more, see Error List Window from Microsoft. To view more examples of unsupported LINQ expressions, see the MongoDB Analyzer Github repository. \nANALYZE LINQ3 \nTo analyze a LINQ3 expression, you must configure the MongoDB Analyzer to use the LINQ3 provider. To learn how to configure your LINQ provider, see the configuration guide. \nIMPORTANT \nEXPRESSIONS SUPPORTED ONLY BY LINQ3 If your .NET driver version supports LINQ3 but you configure your MongoDB Analyzer to use the default LINQ provider (LINQ2), the MongoDB Analyzer informs you if your LINQ expression is supported by LINQ3 but not LINQ2. Click the tabs to see a LINQ expression supported by LINQ3 but not LINQ2 and the corresponding warning output by the MongoDB Analyzer:  \nTo view examples of expressions the .NET driver only supports with the LINQ3 provider, see the MongoDB Analyzer Github repository. ←  Analyze Builders ExpressionsConfigure the MongoDB Analyzer → On this page  * Overview\n * Translate into the MongoDB Query API\n
