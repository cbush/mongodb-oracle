If you prefer to connect to MongoDB using a different driver or programming language, see our list of official MongoDB drivers. The Go driver lets you connect to and communicate with MongoDB clusters from a Go application. MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service that hosts your data on MongoDB clusters. In this guide, we show you how to get started with your own free (no credit card required) cluster. Follow the steps below to connect your Go application with a MongoDB Atlas cluster. \nSET UP YOUR PROJECT  INITIALIZE WITH GO MOD \nCreate a new directory and initialize your project with go mod. mkdir go-quickstartcd go-quickstartgo mod init go-quickstart  \nADD MONGODB AS A DEPENDENCY \nUse go get to add the Go driver as a dependency. go get go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo  \nADD OTHER DEPENDENCIES \nUse go get to add any additional dependencies. This Quick Start uses the godotenv package to read a MongoDB connection string from an environment variable to avoid embedding credentials within source code. go get github.com/joho/godotenv  \nCREATE A MONGODB CLUSTER  SET UP A FREE TIER CLUSTER IN ATLAS \nAfter setting up your Go project dependencies, create a MongoDB cluster where you can store and manage your data. Complete the Get Started with Atlas guide to set up a new Atlas account, free tier MongoDB cluster, load datasets, and interact with the data. After completing the steps in the Atlas guide, you should have a new MongoDB cluster deployed in Atlas, a new database user, and sample datasets loaded into your cluster. CONNECT TO YOUR CLUSTER \nIn this step, you create and run an application that uses the Go driver to connect to your MongoDB cluster and run a query on the sample data. You pass instructions to the driver on where and how to connect to your MongoDB cluster in a string called the connection string. This string includes information on the hostname or IP address and port of your cluster, authentication mechanism, user credentials when applicable, and other connection options. To retrieve your connection string for the cluster and user you created in the previous step, log into your Atlas account and navigate to the Database section and click the Connect button for the cluster that you want to connect to as shown below.  Proceed to the Connect Your Application step and select the Go driver. Then, click the Copy button to copy the connection string to your clipboard as shown below.  Save your Atlas connection string in a safe location that you can access for the next step. To learn more about conencting to the Go driver through Atlas, see the Atlas driver connection guide and select Go from the Select your language dropdown. \nQUERY YOUR MONGODB CLUSTER FROM YOUR APPLICATION \nNext, create a file to contain your application called main.go in the base directory of your project. Use the following sample code to run a query on your sample dataset in MongoDB Atlas. Set the value of the uri variable with your MongoDB Atlas connection string, or create an environmental variable with the name MONGODB_URI with your Atlas connection string. export MONGODB_URI='<your

New features of the 1.11 Go driver release include:  * Removal of support for MongoDB versions 3.5 and older.  * Removal of support for Go versions 1.12 and older.  * Improvements to Timeout API and behavior, including:\n   \n   * Modified retry logic for greater application resiliency.\n   \n   * Extended mongo.IsTimeout error helper to catch more timeout errors.\n   \n   * New GridFS methods that take contexts instead of using SetReadDeadline and SetWriteDeadline.  * Reduced memory allocations during operation execution.  * Fix for SRV polling bug that prevented changes in SRV records when the associated MongoDB connection string included a username and password.  * Support for GCP service accounts when using Google Cloud Key Management Services.  * Improvements to server-side resource cleanup when using the Cursor.All and Session.WithTransaction functions.  * SERVICE_HOST Kerberos authentication parameter specification enabled with the authMechanismProperties connection string option. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 1.10  IMPORTANT \nUPGRADE TO VERSION 1.10.1 OR HIGHER The 1.10.1 Go driver patches a bug that can cause data corruption when rotating Data Encryption Keys encrypted with a Customer Master Key hosted on Google Cloud Key Management Service or Azure Key Vault. New features of the 1.10 Go driver release include:  * Full compatibility with MongoDB 6.0.  * Support for new features related to Queryable Encryption, including new options for automatic and manual encryption.  * Support for the new Automatic Encryption Shared Library, which replaces the mongocryptd process. The shared library requires MongoDB v6.0 Enterprise or later and libmongocrypt 1.5.0 or later.  * clustered index creation support.  * A new API and ClientEncryption entity operations for encryption key management.  * A Timeout client option to set default context timeouts for each operation sent through that client.  * A patch to default data to either primitive.M or primitive.D when decoding empty types.  * Support for encoding atypical map key types for data that can be unmarshalled into a textual representation of itself.  * Performance optimizations, including:\n   \n   * Improved full document requests for before and after updates in change stream events.\n   \n   * Improved PRN and UUID generation.\n   \n   * Reduced memory consumption when compressing wire messages.  * Troubleshooting support for frequently encountered issues. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 1.9 \nNew features of the 1.9 Go driver release include:  * Improved connection storm mitigation.  * Custom options to change-stream and aggregate operations.  * Let option on most CRUD commands that specifies parameters for use in an aggregate expression. Let must be a document that maps parameter names to values that are constant or closed expressions without references to document fields. MongoDB v5.0 or later is required.  * New constructor functions that create Cursor and SingleResult instances from marshalable and non-nil BSON documents. \nWHAT'S NEW IN 1.8 \nNew features of the 1.8

Authenticate to LDAP (PLAIN)\n * Example\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to authenticate in MongoDB using the authentication mechanisms available in the MongoDB Enterprise Edition. Authentication mechanisms are processes by which the driver and server confirm the identity of a client to ensure security before connecting. You can use the following authentication mechanisms with the latest version of the MongoDB Enterprise Edition:      * GSSAPI/Kerberos  * LDAP (Plain) To authenticate using another mechanism, see the Authentication Mechanisms fundamentals page. To learn more about establishing a connection to your MongoDB cluster, see the Connection Guide. You can specify your authentication mechanism and credentials when connecting to MongoDB through the following methods:  * Using a connection string URI. To learn more about using a connection string URI for enterprise authentication, see the Server manual entry on connection string URIs.  * Specifying credentials and an authentication mechanism in the Credential type. \nAUTHENTICATE TO GSSAPI/KERBEROS \nThe Generic Security Services API (GSSAPI) authentication mechanism allows the user to authenticate to a Kerberos service using the user's principal. You must use the gssapi build tag and specify cgo support during compilation to use Kerberos authentication. cgo support is enabled by default unless you previously set environment variables to cross-compile to a different platform. To use the gssapi build tag, compile your code with the following command: go build -tags gssapi  \nEXAMPLE \nThis example specifies the authentication mechanism using the following placeholders:  * username: Your Kerberos principal. A sample username is myuser@KERBEROS.EXAMPLE.COM.  * password: Your Kerberos user's password. You can also store your password in a keytab file to avoid exposing your password in your code.  * connection uri: Your connection string URI. The following code shows how you can define a Credential struct to authenticate to Kerberos and create a client with your authentication preferences: credential := options.Credential{        AuthMechanism: \"GSSAPI\",        Username:      \"<username>\",        Password:      \"<password>\",        PasswordSet:   true,}\nuri := \"<connection uri>\"clientOpts := options.Client().ApplyURI(uri).SetAuth(credential)\nclient, err := mongo.Connect(context.TODO(), clientOpts)  You don't need to define a password or the PasswordSet field in your Credential struct if you store authentication keys in keytab files. You can initialize a credential cache for authenticating the Kerberos principal using the kinit binary. To learn more about the kinit binary, see the Oracle documentation. The following command shows how you can invoke a credential cache for a sample username: kinit myuser@KERBEROS.EXAMPLE.COM  You can alternatively authenticate using a connection string URI, specifying your URL-encoded Kerberos principal, password, and hostname, the network address of your MongoDB server: uri := \"mongodb://<username>:<password>@<hostname>/?authMechanism=GSSAPI\"  \nSET CUSTOM SERVICE_NAME AND SERVICE_REALM FIELDS \nYou can specify additional properties with your authentication mechanism using the AuthMechanismProperties field in the Credential struct. The default service name for Kerberos is \"mongodb\".

GridFS specification. GridFS splits large files into chunks and stores each chunk as a separate document. When you query GridFS for a file, the driver will reassemble the chunks as needed. The driver implementation of GridFS is an abstraction that manages the operations and organization of the file storage. Use GridFS if the size of your files exceeds the BSON document size limit of 16 MB. GridFS is also useful for accessing files without loading the entire file into memory. For more detailed information on whether GridFS is suitable for your use case, see the GridFS server manual page. \nHOW GRIDFS WORKS \nGridFS organizes files in a bucket, a group of MongoDB collections that contain the chunks of files and information describing them. The bucket contains the following collections:      * The chunks collection, which stores the binary file chunks.  * The files collection, which stores the file metadata. When you create a new GridFS bucket, the driver creates the preceding collections. The default bucket name fs prefixes the collection names, unless you specify a different bucket name. The driver creates the new GridFS bucket during the first write operation. The driver also creates an index on each collection to ensure efficient retrieval of the files and related metadata. The driver creates indexes if they do not already exist and when the bucket is empty. For more information on GridFS indexes, see the server manual page on GridFS Indexes. When storing files with GridFS, the driver splits the files into smaller chunks, each represented by a separate document in the chunks collection. It also creates a document in the files collection that contains a file ID, file name, and other file metadata. The following diagram shows how GridFS splits the uploaded files:  When retrieving files, GridFS fetches the metadata from the files collection in the specified bucket, then uses that information to reconstruct the file from documents in the chunks collection. You can read the file into memory or output it to a stream. \nUSE GRIDFS \nTo learn about GridFS operations and how to perform them, navigate to the following sections:  * Create a GridFS Bucket  * Upload Files  * Retrieve File Information  * Download Files  * Rename Files  * Delete Files  * Delete a GridFS Bucket \nCREATE A GRIDFS BUCKET \nTo store or retrieve files from GridFS, create a bucket or get a reference to an existing bucket on a MongoDB database. To create a GridFSBucket instance, call the NewBucket() method with a database parameter: db := client.Database(\"myDB\")bucket, err := gridfs.NewBucket(db)if err != nil {   panic(err)}  \nNOTE If a GridFS bucket already exists, the NewBucket() method returns a reference to the bucket rather than instantiating a new one. By default, the new bucket is named fs. To instantiate a bucket with a custom name, call the SetName() method on a BucketOptions instance as follows: db := client.Database(\"myDB\")opts := options.GridFSBucket().SetName(\"custom name\")bucket, err := gridfs.NewBucket(db, opts)\nif err != nil {   panic(err)}  \nUPLOAD FILES \nYou can upload a file into a GridFS bucket in one of the following ways:  * Use the UploadFromStream() method, which reads from an input stream.  * Use the OpenUploadStream() method, which writes to an output stream. For either upload process, you can specify configuration information on an instance of UploadOptions. For a full list of UploadOptions fields, visit the API documentation. UPLOAD WITH AN INPUT STREAM \nTo upload a file with an input stream, use the UploadFromStream() method with the following parameters:  * Your file name  * An io.Reader, with your opened file as a parameter  * An optional opts parameter to modify the behavior of UploadFromStream() The following code example reads from a file called file.txt and uploads the content to a GridFS bucket.

\nVIEW OUTPUT \nNOTE The driver uniquely generates each object ID number. The ID number outputted will resemble the sample output but varies with each file and user. UPLOAD WITH AN OUTPUT STREAM \nTo upload a file with an output stream, use the OpenUploadStream() method with the following parameters:  * Your file name  * An optional opts parameter to modify the behavior of OpenUploadStream() The following code example opens an upload stream on a GridFS bucket and sets the number of bytes in each chunk with an opts parameter. Then, it calls the Write() method on the content of file.txt to write its content to the stream: file, err := os.Open(\"path/to/file.txt\")if err != nil {\tpanic(err)}uploadOpts := options.GridFSUpload().SetChunkSizeBytes(200000)uploadStream, err := bucket.OpenUploadStream(\"file.txt\", uploadOpts)if err != nil {\tpanic(err)}fileContent, err := io.ReadAll(file)if err != nil {\tpanic(err)}var bytes intif bytes, err = uploadStream.Write(fileContent); err != nil {\tpanic(err)}fmt.Printf(\"New file uploaded with %d bytes written\", bytes)  \nRETRIEVE FILE INFORMATION \nYou can retrieve file metadata stored in the files collection of the GridFS bucket. Each document in the files collection contains the following information:  * The file ID  * The file length  * The maximum chunk size  * The upload date and time  * The file name  * A metadata document in which you can store any other information To retrieve file data, call the Find() method on a GridFSBucket instance. You can pass a query filter as an argument to Find() to match only certain file documents. \nNOTE The Find() method requires a query filter as a parameter. To match all documents in the files collection, pass an empty query filter to Find(). The following example retrieves the file name and length of documents in the files collection with length values greater than 1500: filter := bson.D{{\"length\", bson.D{{\"$gt\", 1500}}}}cursor, err := bucket.Find(filter)if err != nil {   panic(err)}\ntype gridfsFile struct {   Name   string `bson:\"filename\"`   Length int64  `bson:\"length\"`}var foundFiles []gridfsFileif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &foundFiles); err != nil {   panic(err)}\nfor _, file := range foundFiles {   fmt.Printf(\"filename: %s, length: %d\\n\", file.Name, file.Length)}  \nDOWNLOAD FILES \nYou can download a GridFS file in one of the following ways:  * Use the DownloadToStream() method to download a file to an output stream.  * Use the OpenDownloadStream() method to open an input stream. DOWNLOAD A FILE TO AN OUTPUT STREAM \nYou can download a file in a GridFS bucket directly to an output stream using the DownloadToStream() method. DownloadToStream() takes a file ID and an io.Writer as parameters. The method downloads the file with the specified file ID and writes to the io.Writer. The following example downloads a file and writes to a file buffer: id, err := primitive.ObjectIDFromHex(\"62f7bd54a6e4452da13b3e88\")fileBuffer := bytes.NewBuffer(nil)if _, err := bucket.DownloadToStream(id, fileBuffer); err != nil {   panic(err)}  DOWNLOAD A FILE TO AN INPUT STREAM \nYou can download a file in a GridFS bucket to memory with an input stream using the OpenDownloadStream() method. OpenDownloadStream() takes a file ID as a parameter and returns an input stream from which you can read the file. The following example downloads a file into memory and reads its contents: id, err := primitive.ObjectIDFromHex(\"62f7bd54a6e4452da13b3e88\")downloadStream, err := bucket.OpenDownloadStream(id)if err != nil {   panic(err)}\nfileBytes := make([]byte, 1024)if _, err := downloadStream.Read(fileBytes); err != nil {   panic(err)}  \nRENAME FILES \nYou can update the name of a GridFS file in your bucket by using the Rename() method. Pass a file ID value and a new filename value as arguments to Rename().

\nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use indexes in the MongoDB Go Driver. Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Without indexes, MongoDB scans every document in a collection (a collection scan) to find documents that match your query. Collection scans are slow and can negatively affect the performance of your application. With an appropriate index, MongoDB limits the number of documents it inspects. \nTIP You can also use indexes in update operations, delete operations, and certain aggregation pipeline stages. \nQUERY COVERAGE AND PERFORMANCE \nA query in MongoDB can contain the following elements: Element\nNecessity\nPurpose\nQuery\nRequired\nSpecify the fields and values you're looking for.\nOptions\nOptional\nSpecify how the query executes.\nProjection\nOptional\nSpecify the fields that MongoDB should return.\nSort\nOptional\nSpecify the order MongoDB returns documents. When you specify these elements in the same index, MongoDB returns results directly from the index, also called a covered query. \nIMPORTANT \nSORT CRITERIA Your sort criteria must match or invert the order of the index. Consider an index on the field name in ascending order (A-Z) and age in descending order (9-0): name_1_age_-1 MongoDB uses this index when you sort your data by either:      * name ascending, age descending  * name descending, age ascending Specifying a sort order of name and age ascending or name and age descending would require an in-memory sort. To learn how to ensure your index covers your query criteria and projection, see Query Coverage. \nOPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS \nTo improve your query performance, create indexes on fields that appear often in your queries and operations that return sorted results. You should track index memory and disk usage for capacity planning since each index that you add consumes disk space and memory. In addition, when a write operation updates an indexed field, MongoDB also has to update the related index. Since MongoDB supports dynamic schemas, your application can query against fields with currently unknown or arbitrary names. MongoDB 4.2 introduced wildcard indexes to help support these queries. Wildcard indexes are not designed to replace workload-based index planning. To learn more about designing your data model and choosing indexes appropriate for your application, see Indexing Strategies and Data Modeling and Indexes. \nINDEX TYPES \nMongoDB supports several index types to support querying your data. The following sections describe and show how to create the most common index types. To view a full list of index types, see Indexes. \nSINGLE FIELD INDEXES \nSingle field indexes holds a reference to a field within a collection's documents. This index improves single field queries and sort performance, and supports TLL indexes that automatically remove documents from a collection after a certain amount of time. \nNOTE The _id_ index is an example of a single field index. This index is automatically created on the _id field when you create a new collection. EXAMPLE \nThe following example creates an index in ascending order on the title field in the sample_mflix.movies collection: indexModel := mongo.IndexModel{    Keys: bson.D{{\"title\", 1}}}name, err := coll.Indexes().CreateOne(context.TODO(), indexModel)if err != nil {    panic(err)}\nfmt.Println(\"Name of Index Created: \" + name) \nVIEW OUTPUT \nCOMPOUND INDEXES \nCompound indexes hold a reference to multiple fields within a collection's documents. This index improves query and sort performance.

\nVIEW OUTPUT \nMULTIKEY INDEXES (INDEXES ON ARRAY FIELDS) \nMultikey indexes use the same syntax as a single field index and a compound index. This index improves the performance of queries that specify an array field as an index. EXAMPLE \nThe following example creates a multikey index on the cast field in the sample_mflix.movies collection: indexModel := mongo.IndexModel{    Keys: bson.D{{\"cast\", -1}}}name, err := coll.Indexes().CreateOne(context.TODO(), indexModel)if err != nil {    panic(err)}\nfmt.Println(\"Name of Index Created: \" + name) \nVIEW OUTPUT \nCLUSTERED INDEXES \nClustered indexes improve the performance of insert, update, and delete operations on clustered collections. Clustered collections store documents ordered by the clustered index key value. To create a clustered index, specify the clustered index option with the _id field as the key and the unique field as true when you create your collection. EXAMPLE \nThe following example creates a clustered index on the _id field in the tea.vendors collection: db := client.Database(\"tea\")cio := bson.D{{\"key\", bson.D{{\"_id\", 1}}}, {\"unique\", true}}opts := options.CreateCollection().SetClusteredIndex(cio)\ndb.CreateCollection(context.TODO(), \"vendors\", opts)  \nTEXT INDEXES \nText indexes support text search queries on string content. This index requires a string field or an array of strings. MongoDB supports text search for several languages. You can specify the default language as an option when creating the index. A collection can only contain one text index. If you want to create a text index for multiple text fields, you need to create a compound index. The text search runs on all the text fields within the compound index. \nTIP Text indexes differ from the more powerful Atlas full text search indexes. Atlas users should use Atlas search. EXAMPLE \nThe following example creates a text index on the plot field with italian as the default language in the sample_mflix.movies collection: indexModel := mongo.IndexModel{Keys: bson.D{{\"title\", 1}}}name, err := coll.Indexes().CreateOne(context.TODO(), indexModel)if err != nil {    panic(err)}\nfmt.Println(\"Name of Index Created: \" + name) \nVIEW OUTPUT \nGEOSPATIAL INDEXES \nMongoDB supports queries containing geospatial coordinate data by using 2dsphere indexes. A 2dsphere index must be in a GeoJSON objects field. This index allows you to perfrom the following:  * Query geospatial data for inclusion, intersection, and proximity.  * Calculation of distances on a Euclidean plane and for working with the \"legacy coordinate pairs\" syntax used in MongoDB 2.2 and earlier. EXAMPLE \nThe location.geo field in a document from the sample_mflix.theaters collection is a GeoJSON Point object that describes the coordinates of the theater: {   \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"59a47286cfa9a3a73e51e75c\"),   \"theaterId\" : 104,   \"location\" : {      \"address\" : {         \"street1\" : \"5000 W 147th St\",         \"city\" : \"Hawthorne\",         \"state\" : \"CA\",         \"zipcode\" : \"90250\"      },      \"geo\" : {         \"type\" : \"Point\",         \"coordinates\" : [            -118.36559,            33.897167         ]      }   }}  The

Geospatial Queries\n * Query Operators\n * Examples\n * Query by Proximity\n * Query Within a Range\n * Additional Resources \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to work with geospatial data; data formats, indexes, and queries. Geospatial data represents a geographic location on the surface of the Earth, or data on a Euclidean plane. Examples of geospatial data include:      * Locations of movie theaters  * Borders of countries  * Routes of bicycle rides  * Dog exercise areas in New York City  * Points on a graph \nSTORE GEOSPATIAL DATA \nAll geospatial data in MongoDB is stored in one of the following formats:  * GeoJSON, a format that represents geospatial data on an earth-like sphere.  * Legacy Coordinate Pair, a format that represents geospatial data on a Euclidean plane. \nGEOJSON \nUse GeoJSON to store data that represents geospatial information on an earth-like sphere. GeoJSON is composed of one or more positions and a type. POSITIONS \nA position represents a single place on Earth and exists in code as an array containing the following values:  * Longitude in the first position (required)  * Latitude in the second position (required)  * Elevation in the third position (optional) The following is the position of the MongoDB Headquarters in New York City, NY. []float64{-73.986805, 40.7620853} \nIMPORTANT \nLONGITUDE THEN LATITUDE GeoJSON orders coordinates as longitude first and latitude second. This may be surprising as geographic coordinate system conventions generally list latitude first and longitude second. Make sure to check what format any other tools you are working with use. Popular tools such as OpenStreetMap and Google Maps list coordinates as latitude first and longitude second. TYPES \nYour GeoJSON object's type determines the geometric shape it represents. Geometric shapes are made up of positions. Here are some common GeoJSON types and how you can specify them with positions:  * Point: a single position. The following Point represents the location of the MongoDB Headquarters:\n   \n   bson.D{    {\"name\", \"MongoDB HQ\"},    {\"location\", bson.D{        {\"type\", \"Point\"},        {\"coordinates\", []float64{-73.986805, 40.7620853}},    }},}  * LineString: an array of two or more positions that forms a series of line segments. A LineString can represent a path, route, border, or any other linear geospatial data. The following LineString represents a segment of the Great Wall of China:\n   \n   bson.D{    {\"name\", \"Great Wall of China\"},    {\"location\", bson.D{        {\"type\", \"LineString\"},

To learn more about the GeoJSON types you can use in MongoDB, see the GeoJSON manual entry. For definitive information on GeoJSON, see the official IETF specification. \nLEGACY COORDINATE PAIRS \nUse legacy coordinate pairs to store data that represents geospatial information on a two-dimensional Euclidean plane. Your field should contain an array of two values in which the first represents the x axis value and the second represents the y axis value. bson.D{{\"center\", []int16{0, 0}}} For more information on legacy coordinate pairs, see the MongoDB server manual page on legacy coordinate pairs. \nGEOSPATIAL INDEXES \nTo enable querying for geosptial data, you must first create a supporting index. The following index types that enable geospatial queries:  * 2dsphere for GeoJSON data  * 2d for legacy coordinate pairs \n2DSPHERE \nTo query data stored in the GeoJSON format, add the field containing both the type and coordinates to a 2dsphere index. The following snippet creates a 2dsphere index on the location field: indexModel := mongo.IndexModel{    Keys:    bson.D{{\"location\", \"2dsphere\"}},}\nname, err := coll.Indexes().CreateOne(context.TODO(), indexModel)if err != nil {    panic(err)}  \n2D \nTo query data stored as legacy coordinate pairs, you must add the field containing legacy coordinate pairs to a 2d index. The following snippet creates a 2d index on the coordinates field: indexModel := mongo.IndexModel{    Keys:    bson.D{{\"location.coordinates\", \"2d\"}},}\nname, err := coll.Indexes().CreateOne(context.TODO(), indexModel)if err != nil {    panic(err)}  \nGEOSPATIAL QUERIES \nTo perform a geospatial query, create a query filter with a field name and a geospatial query operator. You can specify additional options for certain geospatial query operators to limit the documents returned. If you have not done so, you must create a geospatial index to enable geospatial queries. \nTIP \nSUPPORTED OPERATORS Spherical (2dsphere) and flat (2d) indexes support some, but not all, of the same query operators. For a full list of operators and their index compatibility, see the manual entry for geospatial queries. \nQUERY OPERATORS \nTo query your geospatial data, use one of the following query operators:  * $near  * $geoWithin  * $nearSphere  * $geoIntersects requires a 2dsphere index When using the $near operator, you can specify the following distance operators:  * $minDistance  * $maxDistance When using the $geoWithin operator, you can specify the following shape operators:  * $box  * $polygon  * $center  * $centerSphere For more information on geospatial query operators, see the manual entry for geospatial queries. \nEXAMPLES \nThe following examples use the MongoDB Atlas sample dataset. You can load sample datasets into your database on the free tier of MongoDB Atlas by following the Get Started with Atlas Guide or you can import the sample dataset into a local MongoDB instance. The examples use the theaters collection in the sample_mflix database from the sample dataset. The theaters collection contains a 2dsphere index on the location.geo field. \nQUERY BY PROXIMITY \nThe following example queries for documents with a location.geo field within 1000 meters of the MongoDB Headquarters in New York City, NY. It returns documents from nearest to farthest. mongoDBHQ := bson.D{{\"type\", \"Point\"}, {\"coordinates\", []float64{-73.986805, 40.7620853}}}\nfilter := bson.D{    {\"location.geo\", bson.D{        {\"$near\", bson.D{            {\"$geometry\", mongoDBHQ},            {\"$maxDistance\", 1000},        }},    }},}var places []bson.Doutput, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter)if err =

MONGODB-AWS\n * X.509 \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use each authentication mechanism available in the MongoDB Community Edition. MongoDB uses authentication mechanisms to confirm an identity and establish trust to ensure security in the driver and server before connecting. To authenticate using GSSAPI/Kerberos or LDAP, see the Enterprise Authentication Mechanisms fundamentals page. To learn more about establishing a connection to your MongoDB cluster, see the Connection Guide. \nSUPPORTED MECHANISMS \nThe Go driver supports the following authentication mechanisms:      * SCRAM-SHA-256  * SCRAM-SHA-1  * MONGODB-CR  * MongoDB-AWS  * X.509 The Go Driver establishes a connection with an authentication mechanism through a Client type. The Client type specifies the mechanism and credentials to use as connection options in a Credential type . To configure these options, pass a Credential type to the SetAuth() method of the ClientOptions type. The following sections demonstrate this process with the five mechanisms the MongoDB Community Edition supports. \nEXAMPLE CONVENTIONS \nEach authentication mechanism contains the following placeholders:  * username - Your MongoDB username  * password - Your MongoDB user's password  * hostname - Your MongoDB servers network address, accessible by your client  * port - Your MongoDB servers port number  * authenticationDb - Your MongoDB database that contains the user's authentication data. If you omit this option, the driver uses the default value admin. \nDEFAULT \nThe default mechanism uses one of the following authentication mechanisms depending on what MongoDB versions your server supports: Mechanism\nVersions\nSCRAM-SHA-256\nMongoDB 4.0 and later\nSCRAM-SHA-1\nMongoDB 3.0, 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6\nMONGODB-CR\nMongoDB 2.6 and earlier To specify the default authentication mechanism, omit the AuthMechanism option: credential := options.Credential{   AuthSource: \"<authenticationDb>\",   Username: \"<username>\",   Password: \"<password>\",}clientOpts := options.Client().ApplyURI(\"mongodb://<hostname>:<port>\").   SetAuth(credential)\nclient, err := mongo.Connect(context.TODO(), clientOpts)  To learn more about the challenge-response (CR) and salted challenge-response authentication mechanisms (SCRAM) that MongoDB supports, see the SCRAM section of the server manual. \nSCRAM-SHA-256  IMPORTANT SCRAM-SHA-256 is the default authentication method for MongoDB starting in MongoDB 4.0. SCRAM-SHA-256 is a salted challenge-response authentication mechanism (SCRAM) that uses your username and password, encrypted with the SHA-256 algorithm, to authenticate your user. To specify the SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication mechanism, assign the AuthMechanism option the value \"SCRAM-SHA-256\": credential := options.Credential{   AuthMechanism: \"SCRAM-SHA-256\",   AuthSource: \"<authenticationDb>\",   Username: \"<username>\",   Password: \"<password>\",}clientOpts := options.Client().ApplyURI(\"mongodb://<hostname>:<port>\").   SetAuth(credential)\nclient, err := mongo.Connect(context.TODO(), clientOpts)  \nSCRAM-SHA-1  IMPORTANT SCRAM-SHA-1 is the default authentication method for MongoDB versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6. SCRAM-SHA-1 is a salted challenge-response mechanism (SCRAM) that uses your username and password, encrypted with the SHA-1 algorithm, to authenticate your user.

the Default Collation Example\n * Set a Collation on an Index\n * Example\n * Set a Collation on an Operation\n * Example\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use collations to order your query or aggregation operation results by string values. A collation is a set of character ordering conventions that apply to a specific language and locale. \nCOLLATIONS IN MONGODB \nMongoDB sorts strings using binary collation by default. This collation method uses the ASCII standard character values to compare and order strings. Certain languages and locales have specific character ordering conventions that differ from the ASCII standard. For example, in Canadian French, the right-most accented character determines the ordering for strings when the other characters are the same. Consider the following Canadian French words:      * cote  * coté  * côte  * côté When using the default binary collation, MongoDB sorts them in the following order: cotecotécôtecôté  When using the Canadian French collation, MongoDB sorts them in the following order: cotecôtecotécôté  \nSPECIFY A COLLATION \nTo specify a collation, create a Collation object. You must define the Locale field of the Collation object; all other fields are optional. For example, the following code snippet specifies a Collation object with the \"en_US\" locale collation: myCollation := &options.Collation{Locale: \"en_US\"}  For a complete list of Collation object fields, visit the Collation API documentation. To see all the supported locales and the default values for the Locale fields, visit Supported Languages and Locales. \nSET A COLLATION ON A COLLECTION OR VIEW \nYou can apply a collation when you create a new collection or view. This defines the default collation for any operations called on that collection or view. Set a collation through a CreateCollectionOptions or CreateViewOptions object. Then, call the CreateCollection() or CreateView() method with your options object as an argument. \nCREATE A COLLECTION EXAMPLE \nThe following example creates a new collection called books and specifies a default collation with the \"fr\" locale. The Strength collation field has a value of 1 to ignore differences in letter accents. myCollation := &options.Collation{Locale: \"fr\", Strength: 1}opts := options.CreateCollection().SetCollation(myCollation)err := db.CreateCollection(context.TODO(), \"books\", opts)\nif err != nil {   panic(err)}  \nUSE THE DEFAULT COLLATION EXAMPLE \nIf you call an operation that uses a collation on the books collection, the operation will now use the default collation specified in the Create a Collection Example. Assume the books collection contains the following documents: {\"name\" : \"Emma\", \"length\" : \"474\"}{\"name\" : \"Les Misérables\", \"length\": \"1462\"}{\"name\" : \"Infinite Jest\", \"length\" : \"1104\"}{\"name\" : \"Cryptonomicon\", \"length\" : \"918\"}{\"name\" : \"Ça\", \"length\" : \"1138\"}  \nNOTE To learn how to insert documents, see Insert a Document. The following example uses the Find() method to return all documents with a name value that alphabetically precedes \"Infinite Jest\": filter := bson.D{{\"name\", bson.D{{\"$lt\", \"Infinite Jest\"}}}}cursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter)if err != nil {   panic(err)}\nvar results []bson.Dif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {   panic(err)}for _, result := range results {   fmt.Println(result)} \nVIEW OUTPUT Without specifying a default books collation, the Find() method would follow default binary collation rules to determine the name values that precede \"Infinite Jest\". These rules place words beginning with \"Ç\" after those beginning with \"I\".

transactions with the MongoDB Go Driver. Transactions allow you to run a series of operations that do not change any data until the transaction is committed. If any operation in the transaction fails, the driver aborts the transaction and discards all data changes before they ever become visible. In MongoDB, transactions run within logical sessions. A session is a grouping of related read or write operations that you intend to run sequentially. Sessions enable causal consistency for a group of operations or allow you to execute operations in an ACID transaction. MongoDB guarantees that the data involved in your transaction operations remains , even if the operations encounter unexpected errors. With the Go driver, you can create a new session from a Client instance as a Session type. \nWARNING You should use a Session only with the Client (or associated Database or Collection) that created it. Using a Session with a different Client will result in operation errors. \nWARNING Implementations of Session are not safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines. \nMETHODS \nAfter you start a session using the StartSession() method, you can modify the session state using the method set provided by the Session interface. The following table describes these methods: Method\nDescription\nStartTransaction()\nStarts a new transaction, configured with the given options, on this session. Returns an error if there is already a transaction in progress for the session. For more information, see the manual entry. \nParameter: TransactionOptions\nReturn Type: error\nAbortTransaction()\nAborts the active transaction for this session. Returns an error if there is no active transaction for the session or the transaction has been committed or aborted. For more information, see the manual entry. \nParameter: Context\nReturn Type: error\nCommitTransaction()\nCommits the active transaction for this session. Returns an error if there is no active transaction for the session or the transaction has been aborted. For more information, see the manual entry. \nParameter: Context\nReturn Type: error\nWithTransaction()\nStarts a transaction on this session and runs the fn callback. \nParameters: Context, fn func(ctx SessionContext), TransactionOptions\nReturn Type: interface{}, error\nEndSession()\nAborts any existing transactions and closes the session. \nParameter: Context\nReturn Type: none The Session interface also has methods to retrieve session properties and modify mutable session properties. Find more information in the API documentation. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example shows how you can create a session, create a transaction, and commit a multi-document insert operation through the following steps:       1. Create a session from the client using the StartSession() method.  2. Use the WithTransaction() method to start a transaction.  3. Insert multiple documents. The WithTransaction() method executes the insert and commits the transaction. If any operation results in errors, WithTransaction() handles aborting the transaction.  4. Close the transaction and session using the EndSession() method. wc := writeconcern.New(writeconcern.WMajority())txnOptions := options.Transaction().SetWriteConcern(wc)\nsession, err := client.StartSession()if err != nil {\tpanic(err)}defer session.EndSession(context.TODO())\nresult, err := session.WithTransaction(context.TODO(), func(ctx mongo.SessionContext) (interface{}, error) {\tresult, err := coll.InsertMany(ctx, []interface{}{\t\tbson.D{{\"title\", \"The Bluest Eye\"}, {\"author\", \"Toni Morrison\"}},\t\tbson.D{{\"title\", \"Sula\"}, {\"author\", \"Toni Morrison\"}},\t\tbson.D{{\"title\", \"Song of Solomon\"}, {\"author\", \"Toni Morrison\"}},\t})\treturn result, err}, txnOptions)  If you need more control over your transactions, you can find an example showing how to manually create, commit, and abort transactions in the full code example. \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nFor more information about insert operations, see the Insert a Document fundamentals page. For more information about write concerns, see the Modify Execution of CRUD Operations fundamentals page. For an additional example using sessions and transactions with the Go driver, see the developer blog post on Multi-Document ACID Transactions. \nAPI DOCUMENTATION \nTo learn more about any of the

aggregation operations in the MongoDB Go Driver. Aggregation operations process data in your MongoDB collections based on your specifications in the aggregation pipeline. An aggregation pipeline consists of one or more stages. Each stage performs an operation based on its expression operators. After the driver executes the aggregation pipeline, it returns an aggregated result. \nANALOGY \nAggregation operations operate similarly to a car factory. Car factories have an assembly line. The assembly lines have assembly stations with specialized tools to peform a specific task. To build a car, you send raw parts to the factory. Then, the assembly line transforms and assembles the parts into a car. The assembly line resembles the aggregation pipeline, the assembly stations in the assembly line resemble the aggregation stages, the specialized tools represent the expression operators, and the finished product resembles the aggregated result. \nCOMPARE OPERATIONS \nThe following table lists the tasks you can perform with find and aggregation operations. Find Operations\nAggregation Operations\nSelect what documents to return\nSelect which fields to return\nSort the results\nLimit the results\nCount the results\nSelect what documents to return\nSelect which fields to return\nSort the results\nLimit the results\nCount the results\nRename fields\nCalculate fields\nSummarize data\nGroup values \nLIMITATIONS \nAggregation operations have limitations. When performing agregation operations, keep the following in mind:      * Returned documents must not violate the BSON document size limit of 16 megabytes.  * Pipeline stages have a memory limit of 100 megabytes by default. If required, you may exceed this limit by using the allowDiskUse method.  * The $graphLookup stage has a strict memory limit of 100 megabytes and ignores allowDiskUse. \nEXAMPLES \nThe examples in this section use the following Tea struct as a model for documents in the menu collection: type Tea struct {\tType     string\tCategory string\tToppings []string\tPrice    float32}  To run the examples in this section, load the sample data into the tea.menu collection with the following snippet: coll := client.Database(\"tea\").Collection(\"menu\")docs := []interface{}{\tTea{Type: \"Masala\", Category: \"black\", Toppings: []string{\"ginger\", \"pumpkin spice\", \"cinnamon\"}, Price: 6.75},\tTea{Type: \"Gyokuro\", Category: \"green\", Toppings: []string{\"berries\", \"milk foam\"}, Price: 5.65},\tTea{Type: \"English Breakfast\", Category: \"black\", Toppings: []string{\"whipped cream\", \"honey\"}, Price: 5.75},\tTea{Type: \"Sencha\", Category: \"green\", Toppings: []string{\"lemon\", \"whipped cream\"}, Price: 5.15},\tTea{Type: \"Assam\", Category: \"black\", Toppings: []string{\"milk foam\", \"honey\", \"berries\"}, Price: 5.65},\tTea{Type: \"Matcha\", Category: \"green\", Toppings: []string{\"whipped cream\", \"honey\"}, Price: 6.45},\tTea{Type: \"Earl Grey\", Category: \"black\", Toppings: []string{\"milk foam\", \"pumpkin spice\"}, Price: 6.15},\tTea{Type: \"Hojicha\", Category: \"green\", Toppings: []string{\"lemon\", \"ginger\", \"milk foam\"}, Price: 5.55},}\nresult, err := coll.InsertMany(context.TODO(), docs)  Each document represents a tea on the menu of a shop and contains information about the tea type, the available toppings, and the price. \nAVERAGE RATING \nThe following example calculates and displays the average rating and number of ratings for each tea category. The aggregation pipeline uses the $group stage to group the documents by the category field, calculates the average using the $avg expression operator, and counts the number of documents using the

Docs Home → Go \nWORK WITH BSON \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Data Types\n * Struct Tags\n * Unmarshalling \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn about how the Go Driver handles conversions between BSON and Go types. The process of converting a Go type to BSON is called marshalling, while the reverse process is called unmarshalling. You should read this guide if you want to learn more about how the Go Driver represents BSON data or need to adjust default marshalling and unmarshalling behaviors. \nDATA TYPES \nMongoDB stores documents in a binary representation called BSON that allows for easy and flexible data processing. The Go Driver provides four main types for working with BSON data:      * D: An ordered representation of a BSON document (slice)  * M: An unordered representation of a BSON document (map)  * A: An ordered representation of a BSON array  * E: A single element inside a D type The following example demonstrates how to construct a query filter using the bson.D type to match documents with a quantity field value greater than 100: filter := bson.D{{\"quantity\", bson.D{{\"$gt\", 100}}}}  To learn more about how the Go Driver handles BSON data, see the bson package API documentation. \nSTRUCT TAGS \nIn Go, a struct is a collection of data fields with declared data types. The Go Driver can marshal/unmarshal structs and other native Go types to/from BSON using a configurable codec system. You can modify the default marshalling and unmarshalling behavior of the Go Driver using struct tags, which are optional pieces of metadata attached to struct fields. The most common use of struct tags is for specifying the field name in the BSON document that corresponds to the struct field. The following table describes the additional struct tags that you can use with the Go Driver: Struct Tag\nDescription\nomitempty\nThe field will not be marshalled if it is set to the zero value corresponding to the field type.\nminsize\nIf the field type is type int64, uint, uint32, or uint64 and the value of the field can fit in a signed int32, the field will be serialized as a BSON int32 rather than a BSON int64. If the value can't fit in a signed int32, this tag is ignored.\ntruncate\nIf the field type is a non-float numeric type, BSON doubles unmarshalled into that field will be truncated at the decimal point.\ninline\nIf the field type is a struct or map field, the field will be flattened when marshalling and unflattened when unmarshalling. Without additional instruction from struct tags, the Go Driver will marshal structs using the following rules:  1. The Go Driver only marshals and unmarshals exported fields.  2. The Go Driver generates BSON key using the lowercase of the corresponding struct field.  3. The Go Driver marshals embedded struct fields as subdocuments. Each key is the lowercase of the field's type.  4. The Go Driver marshals a pointer field as the underlying type if the pointer is non-nil. If the pointer is nil, the driver marshals it as a BSON null value.  5. When unmarshalling, the Go Driver follows these D/M type mappings for fields of type interface{}. The driver unmarshals BSON documents unmarshalled into an interface{} field as a D type.   UNMARSHALLING \nYou can unmarshal BSON documents by using the Decode() method on the result of the FindOne method or any *mongo.Cursor instance. The Decode() method returns an error type which contains one of the following values:  * nil if a document matched your query, and there were no errors retrieving and unmarshalling the document.  * If the driver retrieved your document but could not unmarshal your result, the Decode() method returns the unmarshalling error.  * If there was an error retrieving your document during execution of the FindOne() method, the error propagates to the Decode() method and the Decode() method returns the error. When used on the SingleResult type returned by the FindOne() method, Decode() can also return the ErrNoDocuments error if no documents matched the query filter.

The driver creates topology events, also known as Server Discovery and Monitoring (SDAM) events, when there are changes in the state of the instance or cluster that you are connected to. For example, the driver creates an SDAM event when you establish a new connection or when the cluster elects a new primary. You should read this guide if you need to record topology changes in your application or want to explore the information provided by these events. \nSUBSCRIBE TO EVENTS \nYou can access details about SDAM events by subscribing to them in your application. The following example demonstrates how to subscribe to the ServerClosed event by instantiating a ServerMonitor and connecting to a deployment: var eventArray []*event.ServerClosedEventsrvMonitor := &event.ServerMonitor{    ServerClosed: func(e *event.ServerClosedEvent) {        eventArray = append(eventArray, e)    },}clientOpts := options.Client().ApplyURI(uri).SetServerMonitor(svrMonitor)client, err := mongo.Connect(context.Background(), clientOpts)  \nEVENT DESCRIPTIONS \nYou can subscribe to the following SDAM events by specifying properties of a ServerMonitor instance: Event Name\nDescription\nServerDescriptionChangedEvent\nCreated when an instance state changes (such as from secondary to primary).\nServerOpeningEvent\nCreated when the server is initialized.\nServerClosedEvent\nCreated when the server is closed.\nTopologyDescriptionChangedEvent\nCreated when the topology changes, such as an election of a new primary or disconnection of a mongos proxy.\nTopologyOpeningEvent\nCreated when the topology is initialized.\nTopologyClosedEvent\nCreated when the topology is

on Your Local Machine\n * Connect to a Replica Set\n * Connection Options\n * Single Timeout Setting This guide shows you how to connect to a MongoDB instance or replica set deployment using the Go Driver. \nCONNECTION URI \nA connection URI, also known as a connection string, tells the driver how to connect to MongoDB and how to behave while connected. \nPARTS OF A CONNECTION URI \nThe following example explains each part of a sample connection URI:  In this example, we use mongodb for the protocol, which specifies the Standard Connection String Format. You can also use the DNS Seed List Connection Format if you want more flexibility of deployment and the ability to change the servers in rotation without reconfiguring clients. The next part of the connection string contains your username and, if you are using password-based authentication, your password. Replace the value of user with your username and pass with your password. If you are using an authentication mechanism that does not require a username and password, omit this part of the connection URI. The next part of the connection string specifies the hostname or IP address and port of your MongoDB instance. In the preceding example, we use sample.host as the hostname and 27017 as the port. Replace these values to point to your MongoDB instance. The last part of the connection string specifies connection and authentication options. In the example, we set two connection options: maxPoolSize=20 and w=majority. To learn more about connection options, read the Connection Options section of this guide. \nCONNECTION EXAMPLE \nTo connect to MongoDB, you need to create a client. A client manages your connections and runs database commands. You can create a client that uses your connection string and other client options by passing a ClientOptions object to the Connect() method. To specify your connection URI, pass it to the ApplyURI() method, which returns a new ClientOptions instance. To set any other options, call the relevant helper method from the options package. To learn more about connection options, see the Connection Options section. To learn more about creating a client, see the API documentation for Client and Connect(). You can set the Stable API version as an option to avoid breaking changes when you upgrade to a new server version. To learn more about the Stable API feature, see the Stable API page. The following code shows how you can create a client that uses an Atlas connection string and the Stable API version, connect to MongoDB, and verify that the connection is successful: package main\nimport (\t\"context\"\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson\"\t\"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo\"\t\"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/options\")\n// Replace the placeholders with your credentialsconst uri = \"mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.sample.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority\"\nfunc main() {\n\t// Use the SetServerAPIOptions() method to set the Stable API version to 1\tserverAPI := options.ServerAPI(options.ServerAPIVersion1)\topts := options.Client().ApplyURI(uri).SetServerAPIOptions(serverAPI)\n\t// Create a new client and connect to the server\tclient, err := mongo.Connect(context.TODO(), opts)\n\tif err != nil {\t\tpanic(err)\t}\tdefer func() {\t\tif err = client.Disconnect(context.TODO()); err != nil {\t\t\tpanic(err)\t\t}\t}()\n\t// Send a ping to confirm a successful connection\tvar result bson.M\tif err := client.Database(\"admin\").RunCommand(context.TODO(), bson.D{{\"ping\", 1}}).Decode(&result); err != nil {\t\tpanic(err)\t}\tfmt.Println(\"Pinged your deployment. You successfully connected to MongoDB!\")}  \nTIP Follow the Quick Start guide to retrieve your Atlas connection string. \nNOTE To learn about connecting to Atlas Serverless, see the Serverless

\nCONNECT TO A MONGODB SERVER ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE \nIf you need to run a MongoDB server on your local machine for development purposes, you need to complete the following:       1. Download the Community or Enterprise version of MongoDB Server.  2. Install and configure MongoDB Server.  3. Start the server. \nIMPORTANT Always secure your MongoDB server from malicious attacks. See our Security Checklist for a list of security recommendations. After you successfully start your MongoDB server, specify your connection string in your driver connection code. If your MongoDB Server is running locally, you can use the connection string \"mongodb://localhost:<port>\" where <port> is the port number you configured your server to listen for incoming connections. If you need to specify a different hostname or IP address, see our Server Manual entry on Connection Strings. To test whether you can connect to your server, replace the connection string with your localhost connection string in the preceding code example. \nCONNECT TO A REPLICA SET \nA MongoDB replica set deployment is a group of connected instances that store the same set of data. This configuration provides data redundancy and high data availability. To connect to a replica set deployment, specify the hostname and port numbers of each instance, separated by commas, and the replica set name as the value of the replicaSet parameter in the connection string. In the following example, the hostnames are host1, host2, and host3, and the port numbers are all 27017. The replica set name is myRS. mongodb://host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017/?replicaSet=myRS  When connecting to a replica set, the driver takes the following actions by default:  * Discovers all replica set members when given the address of any one member.  * Dispatches operations to the appropriate member, such as instructions to write against the primary. \nTIP You only need to specify one host to connect to a replica set. However, to ensure connectivity when the specified host is unavailable, you should provide the full list of hosts. DIRECT CONNECTION \nTo force operations on the host designated in the connection URI, specify the directConnection option. Direct connections:  * Don't support SRV strings.  * Fail on writes when the specified host is not the primary.  * Require you to specify a secondary read preference when the specified host isn't the primary. \nCONNECTION OPTIONS \nThis section explains several common MongoDB connection and authentication options. You can pass the connection options as parameters of the connection URI to specify the behavior of the client. Option Name\nType\nDefault Value\nDescription\ntimeoutMS\ninteger\nnull\nSpecifies the number of milliseconds that a single operation run on the Client can take before returning a timeout error. Operations honor this setting only if there is no deadline on the operation Context.\nconnectTimeoutMS\ninteger\n30000\nSpecifies the number of milliseconds to wait before timeout on a TCP connection.\nmaxPoolSize\ninteger\n100\nSpecifies the maximum number of connections that a connection pool may have at a given time.\nreplicaSet\nstring\nnull\nSpecifies the replica set name for the cluster. All nodes in the replica set must have the same replica set name, or the Client will not consider them as part of the set.\nmaxIdleTimeMS\ninteger\n0\nSpecifies the maximum amount of time a connection can remain idle in the connection pool before being removed and closed. The default is 0, meaning a connection can remain unused indefinitely.\nminPoolSize\ninteger\n0\nSpecifies the minimum number of connections that the driver maintains in a single connection pool.\nsocketTimeoutMS\ninteger\n0\nSpecifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a socket read or write to return before returning a network error. The 0 default value indicates that there is no timeout.\nserverSelectionTimeoutMS\ninteger\n30000\nSpecifies the number of milliseconds to wait to find an available, suitable server to execute an operation.\nheartbeatFrequencyMS\ninteger\n10000\nSpecifies the number of milliseconds to wait between periodic background server checks.\ntls\nboolean\nfalse\nSpecifies whether to establish a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection with the instance. This is automatically set to true when using a DNS seedlist (SRV) in the connection string. You can override this behavior by setting the value to false.\nw\nstring or integer\nnull\nSpecifies the write concern. To learn more about values, see the server documentation on Write Concern options.\ndirectConnection\nboolean\nfalse\nSpecifies whether to force dispatch all operations to the host specified in the

Docs Home → Go \nRUN A COMMAND \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Execute a Command\n * Response\n * Example\n * Output\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to run a database command with the Go driver. You can use database commands to perform a variety of administrative and diagnostic tasks, such as fetching server statistics, initializing a replica set, or running an aggregation pipeline. \nEXECUTE A COMMAND \nTo run a database command, you must specify the command and any relevant parameters in a command document, then pass the command document to a wrapper method. The command document must be an order-preserving type such as bson.D. The Go driver provides the following methods to run database commands:      * RunCommand(), which returns the command response as a SingleResult type. You can use this method with any database command.  * RunCommandCursor(), which returns the command response as a Cursor type. You can use this method if your database command returns multiple result documents. The following code shows how you can use the RunCommand() method to run the hello command, which returns information about the current member's role in the replica set, on a database: command := bson.D{{\"hello\", 1}}\nvar result bson.Merr = db.RunCommand(context.TODO(), command).Decode(&result)  For a full list of database commands and corresponding parameters, see the Additional Information section. \nNOTE \nREAD PREFERENCE RunCommand() and RunCommandCursor() do not obey the read preference you may have set on your Database object elsewhere in your code. You can set a read preference for command execution by passing a RunCmdOptions object to either method: opts := options.RunCmd().SetReadPreference(readpref.Primary())cursor, err := db.RunCommandCursor(context.TODO(), command, opts)  For more information on read preference options, see the Modify Execution of CRUD Operations fundamentals page. \nRESPONSE \nEach method returns a SingleResult object or a cursor that contains the response from the database after the command has been executed. Each database command performs a different function, so the response content can vary across commands. However, every response contains documents with the following fields: Field\nDescription\n<command result>\nProvides fields specific to the database command. For example, count returns the n field and explain returns the queryPlanner field.\nok\nIndicates whether the command has succeeded (1) or failed (0).\noperationTime Indicates the logical time of the operation. MongoDB uses the logical time to order operations. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: To learn more about logical time, see our blog post about the Global Logical Clock. $clusterTime Provides a document that returns the signed cluster time. Cluster time is a logical time used for ordering of operations. The document contains the following fields:  * clusterTime, which is the timestamp of the highest known cluster time for the member.  * signature, which is a document that contains the hash of the cluster time and the ID of the key used to sign the cluster time. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following code shows how you can use the RunCommand() method to run the explain command for a count operation on the flowers collection of the plants database. The explain command runs in the \"queryPlanner\" verbosity mode: db := client.Database(\"plants\")countCommand := bson.D{{\"count\", \"flowers\"}}explainCommand := bson.D{{\"explain\", countCommand}, {\"verbosity\", \"queryPlanner\"}}\nvar result bson.Merr = db.RunCommand(context.TODO(), explainCommand).Decode(&result)  \nOUTPUT \nIn the output, you should see fields explaining the execution of the count operation, such as the winning plan, which is the plan selected by the query optimizer, and any rejected plans.

Docs Home → Go \nMODIFY EXECUTION OF CRUD OPERATIONS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Write Concern\n * Read Concern\n * Read Preference\n * Additional Information \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to modify the way that the MongoDB Go Driver executes create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations using write concern, read concern, and read preference configurations for replica sets. You can set write concern, read concern, and read preference options at the following levels:      * Client level, which sets the default for all operation executions unless overridden  * Session level  * Transaction level  * Database level  * Collection level  * Query level You should read this guide if you need to customize the consistency and availability of the data in your replica sets. \nWRITE CONCERN \nA write concern describes the number of data-bearing members in a replica set that must acknowledge a write operation, such as an insert or update, before the operation is returned as successful. By default, the write concern requires only the primary replica set member to acknowledge the write operation before the operation is deemed successful. \nOPTIONS \nThe MongoDB Go Driver provides the writeconcern package, which lets you specify the write concern for a replica set. Set the write concern using the SetWriteConcern() method with an Option type. The Option type has the following methods to specify the write concern: Method\nDescription\nJ()\nThe client requests acknowledgement that write operations are written to the journal. For more information, see the Write Concern specification. \nParameter: bool\nW()\nThe client requests acknowledgement that write operations propagate to the specified number of mongod instances. For more information, see the Write Concern specification. \nParameter: int\nWMajority()\nThe client requests acknowledgement that write operations propagate to the majority of mongod instances. For more information, see the Write Concern specification. \nParameter: none\nWTagSet()\nThe client requests acknowledgement that write operations propagate to the specified mongod instance. For more information, see the Write Concern specification. \nParameter: string \nTIP You can alternatively specify a write concern in your connection string. See the Server Manual entry on Write Concern Options for more information. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following code shows how you can specify a write concern to request acknowledgement from two replica set members. The code then creates a Client with this option. uri := \"mongodb://<hostname>:<port>\"wc := writeconcern.W(2)opts := options.Client().ApplyURI(uri).SetWriteConcern(writeconcern.New(wc))client, err := mongo.Connect(context.TODO(), opts)  \nREAD CONCERN \nThe read concern option allows you to determine which data the client returns from a query. The default read concern level is \"local\", meaning that the client returns the instance’s most recent data, with no guarantee that the data has been written to a majority of the replica set members. \nOPTIONS \nThe MongoDB Go Driver provides the readconcern package, which lets you specify the read concern for a replica set. Set the read concern using the SetReadConcern() method with a ReadConcern type. The ReadConcern type has the following methods to specify the read concern: Method\nDescription\nAvailable()\nThe query returns data from the instance with no guarantee that the data has been written to a majority of the replica set members. For more information, see the Read Concern specification.\nLinearizable()\nThe query returns data that reflects all successful writes issued with a write concern of majority and acknowledged prior to the start of the read operation. For more information, see the Read Concern specification.\nLocal()\nThe query returns the instance’s most recent data. For more information, see the Read Concern specification.\nMajority()\nThe query returns the instance’s most recent data acknowledged as having been written to a majority of members in the replica set. For more information, see the Read Concern specification.\nSnapshot()\nThe query returns a complete copy of the data in a mongod instance at a specific point in time. Only available for operations within multi-document transactions. For more information, see the Read Concern specification. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following code shows how you can specify a read concern of \"majority\". The code then selects a Collection with this option. rc := readconcern.Majority()opts := options.Collection().SetReadConcern(rc)database := client.Database(\"myDB\")coll :=

get an accurate and estimated count of the number of documents in your collection. \nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this section use the following Tea struct as a model for documents in the ratings collection: type Tea struct {\tType   string\tRating int32}  To run the examples in this guide, load the sample data into the tea.ratings collection with the following snippet: coll := client.Database(\"tea\").Collection(\"ratings\")docs := []interface{}{\tTea{Type: \"Masala\", Rating: 10},\tTea{Type: \"Matcha\", Rating: 7},\tTea{Type: \"Assam\", Rating: 4},\tTea{Type: \"Oolong\", Rating: 9},\tTea{Type: \"Chrysanthemum\", Rating: 5},\tTea{Type: \"Earl Grey\", Rating: 8},\tTea{Type: \"Jasmine\", Rating: 3},\tTea{Type: \"English Breakfast\", Rating: 6},\tTea{Type: \"White Peony\", Rating: 4},}\nresult, err := coll.InsertMany(context.TODO(), docs)  \nTIP \nNON-EXISTENT DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS If the necessary database and collection don't exist when you perform a write operation, the server implicitly creates them. Each document describes a tea type and its rating. These items correspond to the type and rating fields. \nACCURATE COUNT \nTo count the number of documents that match your query filter, use the CountDocuments() method. \nTIP If you pass an empty query filter, this method returns the total number of documents in the collection. \nMODIFY BEHAVIOR \nYou can modify the behavior of CountDocuments() by passing in a CountOptions type. If you don't specify any options, the driver uses its default values. The CountOptions type allows you to configure options with the following methods: Method\nDescription\nSetCollation()\nThe type of language collation to use when sorting results.\nDefault: nil\nSetHint()\nThe index to use to scan for documents to count.\nDefault: nil\nSetLimit()\nThe maximum number of documents to count.\nDefault: 0\nSetMaxTime()\nThe maximum amount of time that the query can run on the server.\nDefault: nil\nSetSkip()\nThe number of documents to skip before counting.\nDefault: 0 EXAMPLE \nThe following example counts the number of documents where the rating is less than 6: filter := bson.D{{\"rating\", bson.D{{\"$lt\", 6}}}}\ncount, err := coll.CountDocuments(context.TODO(), filter)if err != nil {    panic(err)}fmt.Printf(\"Number of documents with a rating less than six: %d\\n\", count) \nVIEW OUTPUT \nAGGREGATION \nYou can also include the $count stage to count the number of documents in an aggregation pipeline. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example performs the following actions:      * Counts the number of documents where the rating is greater than 5  * Assigns the count to the counted_documents field matchStage := bson.D{{\"$match\", bson.D{{\"rating\", bson.D{{\"$gt\", 5}}}}}}countStage := bson.D{{\"$count\", \"counted_documents\"}}\ncursor, err := coll.Aggregate(context.TODO(), mongo.Pipeline{matchStage, countStage})if err != nil {   panic(err)}\nvar results []bson.Dif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {   panic(err)}for _, result := range results {   fmt.Println(result)} \nVIEW OUTPUT \nESTIMATED COUNT \nTo estimate the number of documents in your collection, use the EstimatedDocumentCount() method. \nNOTE The EstimatedDocumentCount() method is quicker than the CountDocuments() method because it uses the collection's metadata rather than scanning the entire collection. \nMODIFY BEHAVIOR \nYou can modify the behavior of EstimatedDocumentCount() by passing in an EstimatedDocumentCountOptions type. If you don't specify any options, the driver uses its default values.

learn how to perform compound operations. Compound operations combine a read and write operation into a single operation. If you perform a read and write operation separately, there's a chance someone else may alter the document between both operations. MongoDB prevents this by placing a write lock on the document you are modifying for the duration of your compound operation. MongoDB supports the following compound operations:      * Find and delete one document  * Find and update one document  * Find and replace one document \nTIP If you need to read and write to more than one document, use transactions. \nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this guide use the following Course struct as a model for documents in the courses collection: type Course struct {\tTitle      string\tEnrollment int32}  To run the examples in this guide, load the sample data into the db.courses collection with the following snippet: coll := client.Database(\"db\").Collection(\"courses\")docs := []interface{}{\tCourse{Title: \"Representation Theory\", Enrollment: 40},\tCourse{Title: \"Early Modern Philosophy\", Enrollment: 25},\tCourse{Title: \"Animal Communication\", Enrollment: 18},}\nresult, err := coll.InsertMany(context.TODO(), docs)  Each document contains a description of a university course that includes the course title and maximum enrollment, corresponding to the title and enrollment fields in each document. \nTIP \nNON-EXISTENT DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS If the necessary database and collection don't exist when you perform a write operation, the server implicitly creates them. \nFIND AND DELETE \nThe FindOneAndDelete() method finds the first document that matches the specified query filter and deletes it. The method returns a SingleResult containing the deleted document. \nNOTE The FindOneAndDelete() method is an atomic operation, which means it prevents any other write operations from changing the matching document until it completes. The deleteOne() method is also an atomic operation, but differs from FindOneAndDelete() in that you cannot specify a sort order for the matched documents. If you don't need to find and delete a document in a single transaction, you can call the findOne() method followed by the deleteOne() method. \nMODIFY BEHAVIOR \nYou can modify the behavior of the FindOneAndDelete() method by passing in a FineOneAndDeleteOptions. If you don't specify a FineOneAndDeleteOptions, the driver uses the default values for each option. The FineOneAndDeleteOptions type allows you to configure options with the following methods: Method\nDescription\nSetCollation()\nThe type of language collation to use when sorting results.\nDefault: nil\nSetMaxTime()\nThe maximum amount of time that the query can run on the server.\nDefault: nil\nSetProjection()\nThe fields to include in the document returned.\nDefault: nil\nSetSort()\nThe sort fields and directions to order the documents matched.\nDefault: nil\nSetHint()\nThe index to use to scan for documents.\nDefault: nil EXAMPLE \nThe following example uses the FindOneAndDelete() method to match and delete the first document where the enrollment field value is less than 20: filter := bson.D{{\"enrollment\", bson.D{{\"$lt\", 20}}}}\nvar deletedDoc Courseerr := coll.FindOneAndDelete(context.TODO(), filter).Decode(&deletedDoc)if err != nil {   panic(err)}\nres, _ := bson.MarshalExtJSON(deletedDoc, false, false)fmt.Println(string(res)) \nVIEW OUTPUT \nFIND AND UPDATE \nThe FindOneAndUpdate() method finds the first document that matches the specified query filter and updates it according to the update document. The method returns a SingleResult containing the matched document. \nNOTE The FindOneAndUpdate() method is an atomic operation, which means it prevents any other write operations from changing the matching document until it completes. The updateOne() method is also an atomic operation, but differs from FindOneAndUpdate() in that you cannot specify a sort order for the matched documents.

The FineOneAndUpdateOptions type allows you to configure options with the following methods: Method\nDescription\nSetArrayFilters()\nThe array elements the update applies to.\nDefault: nil\nSetBypassDocumentValidation()\nWhether to allow the write operation to opt-out of document level validation.\nDefault: false\nSetCollation()\nThe type of language collation to use when sorting results.\nDefault: nil\nSetMaxTime()\nThe maximum amount of time that the query can run on the server.\nDefault: nil\nSetProjection()\nThe fields to include in the document returned.\nDefault: nil\nSetReturnDocument()\nWhether to return the original or updated document in the SingleResult.\nDefault: options.Before\nSetSort()\nThe sort fields and directions to order the documents matched.\nDefault: nil\nSetUpsert()\nWhether to insert a new document if the query filter doesn't match any documents.\nDefault: false\nSetHint()\nThe index to use to scan for documents.\nDefault: nil EXAMPLE \nThe following example uses the FindOneAndUpdate() method to perform the following actions in order:  * Matches the first document where the title field value includes \"Modern\"  * Updates the matched document's enrollment field value to 32  * Returns the updated document filter := bson.D{{\"title\", bson.D{{\"$regex\", \"Modern\"}}}}update := bson.D{{\"$set\", bson.D{{\"enrollment\", 32}}}}opts := options.FindOneAndUpdate().SetReturnDocument(options.After)\nvar updatedDoc Courseerr := coll.FindOneAndUpdate(context.TODO(), filter, update, opts).Decode(&updatedDoc)if err != nil {    panic(err)}\nres, _ := bson.MarshalExtJSON(updatedDoc, false, false)fmt.Println(string(res)) \nVIEW OUTPUT \nFIND AND REPLACE \nThe FindOneAndReplace() method finds the first document that matches the specified query filter and replaces it with the replacement document. The method returns a SingleResult containing the matched document. \nNOTE This method differs from the ReplaceOne() method. FindOneAndReplace() performs a find and replace as a single operation, and eliminates the possibility of someone altering a document between both operations. \nMODIFY BEHAVIOR \nYou can modify the behavior of the FindOneAndReplace() method by passing in a FineOneAndReplaceOptions. If you don't specify a FineOneAndReplaceOptions, the driver uses the default values for each option. The FineOneAndReplaceOptions type allows you to configure options with the following methods: Method\nDescription\nSetBypassDocumentValidation()\nWhether to allow the write operation to opt-out of document level validation.\nDefault: false\nSetCollation()\nThe type of language collation to use when sorting results.\nDefault: nil\nSetMaxTime()\nThe maximum amount of time that the query can run on the server.\nDefault: nil\nSetProjection()\nThe fields to include in the document returned.\nDefault: nil\nSetReturnDocument()\nWhether to return the original or replaced document in the SingleResult.\nDefault: nil\nSetSort()\nThe sort fields and directions to order the documents matched.\nDefault: nil\nSetUpsert()\nWhether to insert a new document if the query filter doesn't match any documents.\nDefault: false\nSetHint()\nThe index to use to scan for documents.\nDefault: nil EXAMPLE \nThe following example uses the FindOneAndReplace() method to perform the following actions in order:  * Matches the first document where the title is \"Representation Theory\"  * Replaces the matched document with a new document where the title is \"Combinatorial Theory\" and the enrollment is 35 filter := bson.D{{\"title\", \"Representation Theory\"}}replacement := Course{Title: \"Combinatorial Theory\", Enrollment: 35}\nvar outdatedDoc Courseerr := coll.FindOneAndReplace(context.TODO(), filter, replacement).Decode(&previousDoc)if err != nil {    panic(err)}\nres, _ := bson.MarshalExtJSON(outdatedDoc, false, false)fmt.Println(string(res)) \nVIEW OUTPUT \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nTo

Docs Home → Go \nLIMIT THE NUMBER OF RETURNED RESULTS \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Limit\n * Multiple Options\n * Aggregation\n * Additional Information \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to limit the number of documents returned from a read operation. \nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this guide use the following Course struct as a model for documents in the courses collection: type Course struct {\tTitle      string\tEnrollment int32}  To run the examples in this guide, load the sample data into the db.courses collection with the following snippet: coll := client.Database(\"db\").Collection(\"courses\")docs := []interface{}{\tCourse{Title: \"Romantic Era Music\", Enrollment: 15},\tCourse{Title: \"Concepts in Topology\", Enrollment: 35},\tCourse{Title: \"Ancient Greece\", Enrollment: 100},\tCourse{Title: \"Physiology I\", Enrollment: 60},}\nresult, err := coll.InsertMany(context.TODO(), docs)  \nTIP \nNON-EXISTENT DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS If the necessary database and collection don't exist when you perform a write operation, the server implicitly creates them. Each document contains a description of a university course that includes the course title and maximum enrollment, corresponding to the title and enrollment fields in each document. \nLIMIT \nTo limit the number of documents returned from a query, pass the number of documents you want returned to the SetLimit() method of the read operation's options. The following read operations take an options object as a parameter:      * Find()  * CountDocuments()  * gridfs.Bucket.Find() If the limit is 0 or exceeds the number of matched documents, the method returns all the documents. If the limit is a negative number, the method uses the absolute value of the negative number as the limit and closes the cursor after retrieving documents. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example shows how to return two documents that have an enrollment field value greater than 20: filter := bson.D{{\"enrollment\", bson.D{{\"$gt\", 20}}}}opts := options.Find().SetLimit(2)\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter, opts)\nvar results []Courseif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {    panic(err)}for _, result := range results {    res, _ := json.Marshal(result)    fmt.Println(string(res))} \nVIEW OUTPUT \nMULTIPLE OPTIONS \nThe driver performs the limit behavior last regardless of the order in which you set any other options. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example performs a Find() operation with the following behavior:  * Sorts the results in descending order on the enrollment field  * Skips the first document  * Returns the first two of the remaining documents filter := bson.D{}opts := options.Find().SetSort(bson.D{{\"enrollment\", -1}}).SetLimit(2).SetSkip(1)\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter, opts)\nvar results []Courseif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {    panic(err)}for _, result := range results {    res, _ := json.Marshal(result)    fmt.Println(string(res))} \nVIEW OUTPUT \nTIP Using any of the following option configurations also produces the same result: opts := options.Find().SetSort(bson.D{{\"enrollment\", -1}}).SetSkip(1).SetLimit(2)opts := options.Find().SetLimit(2).SetSort(bson.D{{\"enrollment\", -1}}).SetSkip(1)opts := options.Find().SetLimit(2).SetSkip(1).SetSort(bson.D{{\"enrollment\", -1}})opts := options.Find().SetSkip(1).SetSort(bson.D{{\"enrollment\", -1}}).SetLimit(2)opts := options.Find().SetSkip(1).SetLimit(2).SetSort(bson.D{{\"enrollment\", -1}}) \nAGGREGATION \nYou can also include the

MongoDB text search is different than Atlas Search. \nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this guide use the following Dish struct as a model for documents in the menu collection: type Dish struct {\tName        string\tDescription string}  To run the examples in this guide, load the sample data into the db.menu collection with the following snippet: coll := client.Database(\"db\").Collection(\"menu\")docs := []interface{}{\tDish{Name: \"Shepherd’s Pie\", Description: \"A vegetarian take on the classic dish that uses lentils as a base. Serves 2.\"},\tDish{Name: \"Green Curry\", Description: \"A flavorful Thai curry, made vegetarian with fried tofu. Vegetarian and vegan friendly.\"},\tDish{Name: \"Herbed Whole Branzino\", Description: \"Grilled whole fish stuffed with herbs and pomegranate seeds. Serves 3-4.\"},\tDish{Name: \"Kale Tabbouleh\", Description: \"A bright, herb-based salad. A perfect starter for vegetarians and vegans.\"},\tDish{Name: \"Garlic Butter Trout\", Description: \"Baked trout seasoned with garlic, lemon, dill, and, of course, butter. Serves 2.\"},}\nresult, err := coll.InsertMany(context.TODO(), docs)  Each document contains the name and description of a dish on a restaurant's menu. \nTIP \nNON-EXISTENT DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS If the necessary database and collection don't exist when you perform a write operation, the server implicitly creates them. \nTEXT INDEX \nYou must create a text index before running a text search. A text index specifies the string or string array field on which to run a text search. The examples in the following sections run text searches on the description field of documents in the menu collection. To enable text searches on the description field, create a text index with the following snippet: model := mongo.IndexModel{Keys: bson.D{{\"description\", \"text\"}}}name, err := coll.Indexes().CreateOne(context.TODO(), model)if err != nil {\tpanic(err)}\nfmt.Println(\"Name of index created: \" + name)  \nTEXT SEARCH \nA text search retrieves documents that contain a term or a phrase in the text indexed fields. A term is a sequence of characters that excludes whitespace characters. A phrase is a sequence of terms with any number of whitespace characters. To perform a text search, use the $text evaluation query operator, followed by the $search field in your query filter. The $text operator performs a text search on the text indexed fields. The $search field specifies the text to search in the text indexed fields. Query filters for text searches use the following format: filter := bson.D{{\"$text\", bson.D{{\"$search\", \"<text to search>\"}}}}  \nSEARCH BY A TERM \nTo search for a term, specify the term as a string in your query filter. To search for multiple terms, separate each term with spaces in the string. \nNOTE When searching for multiple terms, the Find() method returns documents with at least one of the terms in text indexed fields. EXAMPLE \nThe following example runs a text search for descriptions that contain the term \"herb\": filter := bson.D{{\"$text\", bson.D{{\"$search\", \"herb\"}}}}\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter)if err != nil {   panic(err)}\nvar results []Dishif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {   panic(err)}\nfor _, result := range results {    res, _

\nSEARCH BY A PHRASE \nTo search for a phrase, specify the phrase with escaped quotes as a string in your query filter. If you don't add escaped quotes around the phrase, the Find() method runs a term search. \nTIP Escaped quotes are a backslash character followed by a double quote character. EXAMPLE \nThe following example runs a text search for descriptions that contain the phrase \"serves 2\": filter := bson.D{{\"$text\", bson.D{{\"$search\", \"\\\"serves 2\\\"\"}}}}\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter)if err != nil {   panic(err)}\nvar results []Dishif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {   panic(err)}\nfor _, result := range results {    res, _ := json.Marshal(result)    fmt.Println(string(res))} \nVIEW OUTPUT \nSEARCH WITH TERMS EXCLUDED \nFor each term or phrase you want to exclude from your text search, specify the term or phrase prefixed with a minus sign as a string in your query filter. \nIMPORTANT You must search for at least one term if you want to exclude terms from your search. If you don't search for any terms, the Find() method doesn't return any documents. EXAMPLE \nThe following example runs a text search for descriptions that contain the term \"vegan\", but do not contain the term \"tofu\": filter := bson.D{{\"$text\", bson.D{{\"$search\", \"vegan -tofu\"}}}}\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter)if err != nil {   panic(err)}\nvar results []Dishif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {   panic(err)}\nfor _, result := range results {    res, _ := json.Marshal(result)    fmt.Println(string(res))} \nVIEW OUTPUT \nSORT BY RELEVANCE \nA text search assigns a numerical text score to indicate how closely each result matches the string in your query filter. To reveal the text score in your output, use a projection to retrieve the textScore metadata. You can sort the text score in descending order by specifying a sort on the textScore metadata. EXAMPLE \nThe following example performs the following actions:      * Runs a text search for descriptions that contain the term \"vegetarian\"  * Sorts the results in descending order based on their text score  * Includes only the name and score fields in the final output document filter := bson.D{{\"$text\", bson.D{{\"$search\", \"vegetarian\"}}}}sort := bson.D{{\"score\", bson.D{{\"$meta\", \"textScore\"}}}}projection := bson.D{{\"name\", 1}, {\"score\", bson.D{{\"$meta\", \"textScore\"}}}, {\"_id\", 0}}opts := options.Find().SetSort(sort).SetProjection(projection)\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter, opts)if err != nil {   panic(err)}\nvar results []bson.Dif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {   panic(err)}for _, result := range results {   fmt.Println(result)} \nVIEW OUTPUT \nAGGREGATION \nYou can also include the $text evaluation query operator in the $match stage to perform a text search in an aggregation pipeline. \nMATCH A SEARCH TERM \nThe following example runs a text search for descriptions that contain the term \"herb\": matchStage := bson.D{{\"$match\", bson.D{{\"$text\", bson.D{{\"$search\", \"herb\"}}}}}}\ncursor, err := coll.Aggregate(context.TODO(), mongo.Pipeline{matchStage})if err != nil {   panic(err)}\nvar results []Dishif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {   panic(err)}\nfor _, result

Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to specify the order of your results from read operations. \nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this guide use the following Course struct as a model for documents in the courses collection: type Course struct {\tTitle      string\tEnrollment int32}  To run the examples in this guide, load the sample data into the db.courses collection with the following snippet: coll := client.Database(\"db\").Collection(\"courses\")docs := []interface{}{\tCourse{Title: \"World Fiction\", Enrollment: 35},\tCourse{Title: \"Abstract Algebra\", Enrollment: 60},\tCourse{Title: \"Modern Poetry\", Enrollment: 12},\tCourse{Title: \"Plate Tectonics\", Enrollment: 35},}\nresult, err := coll.InsertMany(context.TODO(), docs)  \nTIP \nNON-EXISTENT DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS If the necessary database and collection don't exist when you perform a write operation, the server implicitly creates them. Each document contains a description of a university course that includes the course title and maximum enrollment, corresponding to the title and enrollment fields in each document. \nSORT DIRECTION \nTo specify the order of your results, pass an interface specifying the sort fields and direction to the SetSort() method of a read operation's options. The following read operations take options as a parameter:      * Find()  * FindOne()  * FindOneAndDelete()  * FindOneAndUpdate()  * FindOneAndReplace()  * gridfs.Bucket.Find() You can set an ascending or descending sort direction. \nASCENDING \nAn ascending sort orders your results from smallest to largest. To specify this sort, pass the field you want to sort by and 1 to the SetSort() method. \nTIP With an ascending sort, the method orders values of type Boolean from false to true, String type values from a to z and numeric type values from negative infinity to positive infinity. EXAMPLE \nThe following example specifies an ascending sort on the enrollment field: filter := bson.D{}opts := options.Find().SetSort(bson.D{{\"enrollment\", 1}})\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter, opts)\nvar results []Courseif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {    panic(err)}for _, result := range results {    res, _ := json.Marshal(result)    fmt.Println(string(res))} \nVIEW OUTPUT \nDESCENDING \nA descending sort orders your results from largest to smallest. To specify this sort, pass the field you want to sort by and -1 to the SetSort() method. \nTIP With an descending sort, the method orders values of type Boolean from true to false, String type values from z to a and numeric type values from positive infinity to negative infinity. EXAMPLE \nThe following example specifies a descending sort on the enrollment field: filter := bson.D{}opts := options.Find().SetSort(bson.D{{\"enrollment\", -1}})\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter, opts)\nvar results []Courseif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {    panic(err)}for _, result := range results {    res, _ := json.Marshal(result)    fmt.Println(string(res))} \nVIEW OUTPUT \nHANDLING TIES \nA tie occurs when two or more documents have identical values in the field you are using to sort your results. MongoDB does not guarantee order if ties occur. For example, in the sample data, there is a tie for enrollment in the following documents: {\"Title\":\"World Fiction\",\"Enrollment\":35}{\"Title\":\"Plate Tectonics\",\"Enrollment\":35} You can sort on additional fields to resolve ties in the original sort. If you want to guarantee a specific order for documents, you should select sort fields that will not result in additional ties.

\nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to specify a query to match a subset of documents. To match a subset of documents, specify a query filter containing your match criteria. Match criteria consist of the fields and values you want present in a document. A query filter contains at least one set of match criteria to determine which documents to include in the resulting set. In a query filter, you can match fields with literal values or with query operators. Query operators allow you to perform mathematical or logical operations to locate documents within a collection. Match criteria with literal values use the following format: filter := bson.D{{\"<field>\", \"<value>\"}} Match criteria with a query operator use the following format: filter := bson.D{{\"<field>\", bson.D{{\"<operator>\", \"<value>\"}}}} The following sections use literal values and query operators with the Find() method to match a subset of documents. \nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this section use the following Tea struct as a model for documents in the ratings collection: type Tea struct {\tType   string\tRating int32\tVendor []string `bson:\"vendor,omitempty\" json:\"vendor,omitempty\"`}  The omitempty struct tag omits the corresponding field from the inserted document when left empty. To run the examples in this guide, load the sample data into the tea.ratings collection with the following snippet: coll := client.Database(\"tea\").Collection(\"ratings\")docs := []interface{}{\tTea{Type: \"Masala\", Rating: 10, Vendor: []string{\"A\", \"C\"}},\tTea{Type: \"English Breakfast\", Rating: 6},\tTea{Type: \"Oolong\", Rating: 7, Vendor: []string{\"C\"}},\tTea{Type: \"Assam\", Rating: 5},\tTea{Type: \"Earl Grey\", Rating: 8, Vendor: []string{\"A\", \"B\"}},}\nresult, err := coll.InsertMany(context.TODO(), docs)  \nTIP \nNON-EXISTENT DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS If the necessary database and collection don't exist when you perform a write operation, the server implicitly creates them. Each document describes a tea type, its rating, and the vendors that carry that variety. These items correspond to the type, rating, and vendor fields. \nLITERAL VALUES \nLiteral value query filters return documents with an exact match to your match criteria. \nTIP If you specify an empty query filter, CRUD operations match all the documents in a collection. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example matches documents where the type is \"Oolong\": filter := bson.D{{\"type\", \"Oolong\"}}\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter)if err != nil {    panic(err)}\nvar results []Teaif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {    panic(err)}for _, result := range results {    res, _ := json.Marshal(result)    fmt.Println(string(res))} \nVIEW OUTPUT \nTIP Literal value queries return the same value as the $eq comparison operator. For example, the following query filters produce the same result: filter := bson.D{{\"type\", \"Oolong\"}}  filter := bson.D{{\"type\", bson.D{{\"$eq\", \"Oolong\"}}}}  \nCOMPARISON \nComparison operators analyze the value in a document against the specified value in your match criteria. Common comparison operators include $gt for \"greater than\" comparisons, $lte for \"less than or equal to\" comparisons, and $ne for \"not equal to\" comparisons. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example

\nVIEW OUTPUT For a full list of comparison operators, see the Comparison Query Operators page. \nLOGICAL \nLogical operators require at least two match criteria. They check if documents meet all, at lease one, or none of the specified criteria. Common logical operators include $and where all match criteria must be true, and $or where at least one of the match criteria must be true. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example matches documents where the rating is greater than 7 and less than or equal to 10: filter := bson.D{   {\"$and\",      bson.A{         bson.D{{\"rating\", bson.D{{\"$gt\", 7}}}},         bson.D{{\"rating\", bson.D{{\"$lte\", 10}}}},      },   },}\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter)if err != nil {   panic(err)}\nvar results []Teaif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {    panic(err)}for _, result := range results {    res, _ := json.Marshal(result)    fmt.Println(string(res))} \nVIEW OUTPUT For a full list of logical operators, see the Logical Query Operators page. \nTIP Multiple match criteria resembling an $eq comparison operator in a literal query return the same value as the $and logical operator. For example, the following query filters produce the same result: filter := bson.D{{\"type\", \"Oolong\"}, {\"rating\", 7}}  filter := bson.D{  {\"$and\",    bson.A{      bson.D{{\"type\", \"Oolong\"}},      bson.D{{\"rating\", 7}},    }},}  \nELEMENT \nElement operators check for the presence or type of the specified field. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example matches documents where the vendor field does not exist: filter := bson.D{{\"vendor\", bson.D{{\"$exists\", false}}}}\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter)if err != nil {   panic(err)}\nvar results []Teaif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {    panic(err)}for _, result := range results {    res, _ := json.Marshal(result)    fmt.Println(string(res))} \nVIEW OUTPUT For a full list of element operators, see the Element Query Operators page. \nEVALUATION \nEvaluation operators analyze values in a document based on the specified value in your match criteria. Common evaluation operators include $regex where a field's value must match the specified regular expression and $text where the field's value must contain the specified string. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example matches documents where the type begins with the letter \"E\": filter := bson.D{{\"type\", bson.D{{\"$regex\", \"^E\"}}}}\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter)if err != nil {   panic(err)}\nvar results []Teaif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {    panic(err)}for _, result := range results {    res, _ := json.Marshal(result)    fmt.Println(string(res))} \nVIEW OUTPUT For a full list of evaluation operators, see the Evaluation Query Operators page. \nARRAY \nArray operators check the values or amount of elements in an array field. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example matches documents where the vendor contains \"C\": filter := bson.D{{\"vendor\", bson.D{{\"$all\", bson.A{\"C\"}}}}}\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter)if err != nil {   panic(err)}\nvar results []Teaif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {    panic(err)}for _, result := range results {    res, _ := json.Marshal(result)

Watch()\n * Pre- and Post-Images\n * Example\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to monitor document changes with a change stream. A change stream outputs new change events, providing access to real-time data changes. You can open a change stream on a collection, database, or client object. \nSAMPLE DATA \nTo run the examples in this guide, load these documents into the db.courses collection with the following snippet: coll := client.Database(\"db\").Collection(\"courses\")docs := []interface{}{\tCourse{Title: \"World Fiction\", Enrollment: 35},\tCourse{Title: \"Abstract Algebra\", Enrollment: 60},\tCourse{Title: \"Modern Poetry\", Enrollment: 12},\tCourse{Title: \"Plate Tectonics\", Enrollment: 35},}\nresult, err := coll.InsertMany(context.TODO(), docs)  \nTIP \nNON-EXISTENT DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS If the necessary database and collection don't exist when you perform a write operation, the server implicitly creates them. Each document contains a description of a university course that includes the course title and maximum enrollment, corresponding to the title and enrollment fields in each document. \nNOTE Each example output shows truncated _data, clusterTime, and ObjectID values because the driver generates them uniquely. \nOPEN A CHANGE STREAM \nTo open a change stream, use the Watch() method. The Watch() method requires a context parameter and a pipeline parameter. To return all changes, pass in an empty Pipeline object. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example opens a change stream on the db.courses collection and outputs all changes: coll := client.Database(\"db\").Collection(\"courses\")\n// open a change stream with an empty pipeline parameterchangeStream, err := coll.Watch(context.TODO(), mongo.Pipeline{})if err != nil {   panic(err)}defer changeStream.Close(context.TODO())\n// iterate over the cursor to print the change-stream eventsfor changeStream.Next(context.TODO()) {   fmt.Println(changeStream.Current)}  If you modify the db.courses collection in a separate program or shell, this code will print your changes as they occur. Inserting a document with a title value of \"Advanced Screenwriting\" and an enrollment value of 20 results in the following change-stream event: map[_id:map[_data:...] clusterTime: {...} documentKey:map[_id:ObjectID(\"...\")]fullDocument:map[_id:ObjectID(\"...\") enrollment:20 title:Advanced Screenwriting] ns:map[coll:courses db:db] operationType:insert] \nMODIFY THE CHANGE STREAM OUTPUT \nUse the pipeline parameter to modify the change stream output. This parameter allows you to only watch for certain change events. Format the pipeline parameter as an array of documents, with each document representing an aggregation stage. You can use the following pipeline stages in this parameter:      * $addFields  * $match  * $project  * $replaceRoot  * $replaceWith  * $redact  * $set  * $unset \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example opens a change stream on the db database, but only watches for new delete operations: db := client.Database(\"db\")\npipeline := bson.D{{\"$match\", bson.D{{\"operationType\", \"delete\"}}}}changeStream, err := db.Watch(context.TODO(), mongo.Pipeline{pipeline})  \nNOTE The Watch() method was called on the db database, so the code outputs new delete operations in any collection within this database. \nMODIFY THE BEHAVIOR OF WATCH() \nUse the options parameter to modify the behavior of the Watch() method. You can specify the following options for the Watch() method:  * ResumeAfter  * StartAfter  * FullDocument  * FullDocumentBeforeChange  * BatchSize  * MaxAwaitTime  * Collation  * StartAtOperationTime

* API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to specify which fields to return in a document from read operations. \nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this guide use the following Course struct as a model for documents in the courses collection: type Course struct {\tTitle      string `bson:\"title,omitempty\"`\tCourseId   string `bson:\"course_id,omitempty\"`\tEnrollment int32  `bson:\"enrollment,omitempty\"`}  The omitempty struct tag directs the driver to exclude fields when unmarshalling based on your projection specification. To run the examples in this guide, load the sample data into the db.courses collection with the following snippet: coll := client.Database(\"db\").Collection(\"courses\")docs := []interface{}{\tCourse{Title: \"Primate Behavior\", CourseId: \"PSY2030\", Enrollment: 40},\tCourse{Title: \"Revolution and Reform\", CourseId: \"HIST3080\", Enrollment: 12},}\nresult, err := coll.InsertMany(context.TODO(), docs)  \nTIP \nNON-EXISTENT DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS If the necessary database and collection don't exist when you perform a write operation, the server implicitly creates them. Each document contains a description of a university course that includes the course title, course ID, and maximum enrollment, corresponding to the title, course_id, and enrollment fields in each document. \nPROJECTION \nA projection specifies which fields to return in matched documents. The projection document contains field names with a 1 to include the corresponding field or 0 to exclude it. If you are using an aggregation framework, you can also specify a projection to include newly computed fields. You can specify a projection by passing a projection document to the SetProjection() method. The following read operations take an options object as a parameter:      * Find()  * FindOne()  * FindOneAndDelete()  * FindOneAndReplace()  * FindOneAndUpdate() \nTIP If you don't specify a projection, the read operation returns all the fields in matched documents. \nEXCLUDE A FIELD \nTo exclude a field, pass the field you want to exclude with a 0 to the SetProjection() method. The driver includes all fields that are not explicitly excluded in the projection document, if you specify any fields to exclude. EXAMPLE \nThe following example excludes the course_id and enrollment fields from the matched documents returned by the Find() method: filter := bson.D{}opts := options.Find().SetProjection(bson.D{{\"course_id\", 0}, {\"enrollment\", 0}})\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter, opts)if err != nil {    panic(err)}\nvar results []Courseif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {    panic(err)}\nfor _, result := range results {    res, _ := bson.MarshalExtJSON(result, false, false)    fmt.Println(string(res))} \nVIEW OUTPUT \nINCLUDE A FIELD \nTo include a field, pass the field you want to include with a 1 to the SetProjection() method. The driver excludes all fields that are not explicitly included in the projection document, if you specify any fields to include. EXAMPLE \nThe following example includes only the title and enrollment fields from the matched documents returned by the Find() method: filter := bson.D{}opts := options.Find().SetProjection(bson.D{{\"title\", 1}, {\"enrollment\", 1}})\ncursor, err := coll.Find(context.TODO(), filter, opts)if err != nil {    panic(err)}\nvar results []Courseif err =

Aggregation\n * Modify Behavior\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to retrieve data from your MongoDB collections using read operations. Read operations allow you to do the following:      * Retrieve documents from your collections by using find operations  * Perform transformations on documents in your collections by using aggregation operations \nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this section use the following Review struct as a model for documents in the reviews collection: type Review struct {\tItem        string\tRating      int32\tDateOrdered time.Time `bson:\"date_ordered\"`}  To run the examples in this guide, load these documents into the tea.reviews collection with the following snippet: coll := client.Database(\"tea\").Collection(\"reviews\")docs := []interface{}{\tReview{Item: \"Masala\", Rating: 10, DateOrdered: time.Date(2009, 11, 17, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.Local)},\tReview{Item: \"Sencha\", Rating: 7, DateOrdered: time.Date(2009, 11, 18, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.Local)},\tReview{Item: \"Masala\", Rating: 9, DateOrdered: time.Date(2009, 11, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.Local)},\tReview{Item: \"Masala\", Rating: 8, DateOrdered: time.Date(2009, 12, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.Local)},\tReview{Item: \"Sencha\", Rating: 10, DateOrdered: time.Date(2009, 12, 17, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.Local)},\tReview{Item: \"Hibiscus\", Rating: 4, DateOrdered: time.Date(2009, 12, 18, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.Local)},}\nresult, err := coll.InsertMany(context.TODO(), docs)  \nTIP \nNON-EXISTENT DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS If the necessary database and collection don't exist when you perform a write operation, the server implicitly creates them. Each document describes the tea variety a customer ordered, their rating, and the date of the order. These descriptions correspond to the item, rating, and date_ordered fields. \nFIND OPERATIONS \nUse find operations to retrieve data from MongoDB. Find operations consist of the Find() and FindOne() methods. \nFIND ALL DOCUMENTS \nThe Find() method expects you to pass a Context type and a query filter. The method returns all documents that match the filter as a Cursor type. To learn how to access data in a cursor, see Access Data From a Cursor. \nFIND ONE DOCUMENT \nThe FindOne() method expects you to pass a Context type and a query filter. The method returns the first document that matches the filter as a SingleResult type. To learn how to access data in a SingleResult see Unmarshalling. \nMODIFY BEHAVIOR \nYou can modify the behavior of Find() and FindOne() by passing in a FindOptions and FindOneOptions type respectively. If you don't specify any options, the driver uses the default values for each option. You can configure the commonly used options in both types with the following methods: Method\nDescription\nSetCollation()\nThe type of language collation to use when sorting results.\nDefault: nil\nSetLimit()\nThe maximum number of documents to return.\nDefault: 0 \nNOTE This option is not available for FindOneOptions. The FindOne() method internally uses SetLimit(-1). SetProjection()\nThe fields to include in the returned documents.\nDefault: nil\nSetSkip()\nThe number of documents to skip.\nDefault: 0\nSetSort()\nThe field and type of sort to order the matched documents. You can specify an ascending or descending sort.\nDefault: none FIND EXAMPLE \nThe following example passes a context, filter, and FindOptions to the Find() method, which performs the following

\nVIEW OUTPUT FIND ONE EXAMPLE \nThe following example passes a context, filter, and FindOneOptions to the FindOne() method, which performs the following actions:  * Matches documents where the date_ordered value is on or before November 30, 2009  * Skips the first two matched documents filter := bson.D{{\"date_ordered\", bson.D{{\"$lte\", time.Date(2009, 11, 30, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.Local)}}}}opts := options.FindOne().SetSkip(2)\nvar result Reviewerr := coll.FindOne(context.TODO(), filter, opts).Decode(&result)if err != nil {    panic(err)}\nres, _ := json.Marshal(result)fmt.Println(string(res)) \nVIEW OUTPUT \nAGGREGATION OPERATIONS \nUse aggregation operations to retrieve and transform data from MongoDB. Perform aggregation operations using the Aggregate() method. \nAGGREGATION \nThe Aggregate() method expects you to pass a Context type and an aggregation pipeline. An aggregation pipeline defines how to transform data through stages. Some of the stages are matching documents, renaming fields, and grouping values. The method returns the resulting documents in a Cursor type. If you omit the $match stage, the pipeline proceeds using all documents in the collection. To learn how to access data in a cursor, see Access Data From a Cursor. \nMODIFY BEHAVIOR \nThe Aggregate() method optionally takes an AggregateOptions type, which represents options you can use to modify its behavior. If you don't specify any options, the driver uses the default values for each option. The AggregateOptions type allows you to configure options with the following methods: Method\nDescription\nSetAllowDiskUse()\nWhether to write to temporary files.\nDefault: false\nSetBatchSize()\nThe number of documents to return in each batch.\nDefault: none\nSetBypassDocumentValidation()\nWhether to allow the write to opt-out of document level validation.\nDefault: false\nSetCollation()\nThe type of language collation to use when sorting results.\nDefault: nil\nSetMaxTime()\nThe maximum amount of time that the query can run on the server.\nDefault: nil\nSetMaxAwaitTime()\nThe maximum amount of time for the server to wait on new documents to satisfy a tailable cursor query.\nDefault: nil\nSetComment()\nAn arbitrary string to help trace the operation through the database profiler, currentOp and logs.\nDefault: \"\"\nSetHint()\nThe index to use to scan for documents to retrieve.\nDefault: nil\nSetLet()\nSpecifies parameters for the aggregate expression, which improves command readability by separating the variables from the query text.\nDefault: none EXAMPLE \nThe following example passes a context and an aggregation pipeline that performs the following actions:  * Groups reviews by item ordered  * Calculates the average rating for each item groupStage := bson.D{   {\"$group\", bson.D{      {\"_id\", \"$item\"},      {\"average\", bson.D{         {\"$avg\", \"$rating\"},      }},}}}\ncursor, err := coll.Aggregate(context.TODO(), mongo.Pipeline{groupStage})if err != nil {   panic(err)}\nvar results []bson.Mif err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &results); err != nil {   panic(err)}for _, result := range results {   fmt.Printf(\"%v had an average rating of %v \\n\", result[\"_id\"], result[\"average\"])} \nVIEW OUTPUT To learn more about how to construct an aggregation pipeline, see the MongoDB server manual page on Aggregation. \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nFor runnable examples of the find operations, see the following usage examples:  * Find a Document  * Find Multiple Documents To learn more about the operations mentioned, see the following guides:  * Specify a Query  * Access Data From a Cursor  * Skip Returned Results  * Sort Results  * Limit the Number of Returned Results  * Specify Which Fields to Return  * Aggregation  * Collations \nAPI DOCUMENTATION \nTo learn more about any of the methods or types discussed in this guide, see

Docs Home → Go \nUPDATE ARRAYS IN A DOCUMENT \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Sample Data\n * Specify Array Elements\n * First Array Element\n * Multiple Array Elements\n * All Array Elements\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to update array elements in one or more documents. To update elements in an array, perform the following actions:      * Provide an update document that specifies the update.  * Specify which array elements to update.  * Perform the update using an update operation with these specifications. \nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this guide use the following Drink struct as a model for documents in the drinks collection: type Drink struct {\tDescription string\tSizes       []int32 `bson:\"sizes,truncate\"`\tStyles      []string}  The truncate struct tag allows the driver to truncate types such as float64 to int32 when unmarshalling. To run the examples in this guide, load the sample data into the db.drinks collection with the following snippet: coll := client.Database(\"db\").Collection(\"drinks\")docs := []interface{}{\tDrink{Description: \"Matcha Latte\", Sizes: []int32{12, 16, 20}, Styles: []string{\"iced\", \"hot\", \"extra hot\"}},}\nresult, err := coll.InsertMany(context.TODO(), docs)  Each document contains a description of a drink that includes the drink's description, available sizes in ounces, and available preparation styles, corresponding to the description, sizes, and styles fields in each document. \nTIP \nNON-EXISTENT DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS If the necessary database and collection don't exist when you perform a write operation, the server implicitly creates them. The following examples use the FindOneAndUpdate() method to retrieve and update a document and to return the state of the document after the update occurs. If you want to update multiple documents with an array field, use the UpdateMany() method. \nSPECIFY ARRAY ELEMENTS \nTo specify which array elements to update, use a positional operator. Positional operators can specify the first, multiple, or all array elements to update. To specify array elements with a positional operator, use dot notation. Dot notation is a property access syntax for navigating array elements and fields of an embedded document. \nFIRST ARRAY ELEMENT \nTo update the first array element that matches your query filter, use the positional $ operator. The query filter must be for the array field. EXAMPLE \nThis example performs the following actions:  * Matches array elements in sizes where the value is less than or equal to 16.  * Decrements the first array value matched by 2. filter := bson.D{{\"sizes\", bson.D{{\"$lte\", 16}}}}update := bson.D{{\"$inc\", bson.D{{\"sizes.$\", -2}}}}opts := options.FindOneAndUpdate().    SetReturnDocument(options.After)\nvar updatedDoc Drinkerr := coll.FindOneAndUpdate(context.TODO(), filter, update, opts).Decode(&updatedDoc)if err != nil {    panic(err)}\nres, _ := bson.MarshalExtJSON(updatedDoc, false, false)fmt.Println(string(res)) \nVIEW OUTPUT \nNOTE The query filter matches the values 12 and 16. Since the operation matches 12 first, it is decremented. If you want to update both matched values, see Multiple Array Elements. \nMULTIPLE ARRAY ELEMENTS \nTo update multiple array elements that match your query filter, use the filtered positional $[<identifier>] operator. You must include an array filter in your update operation to specify which array elements to update. The <identifier> is the name you use within your array filter. This value must begin with a lowercase letter and only contain alphanumeric characters. EXAMPLE \nThis example performs the following actions:  * Creates an array filter with an identifier called hotOptions to match array elements that contain \"hot\".  * Applies the array filter using

Modify InsertMany Behavior\n * Ordered Behavior\n * Additional Information\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to insert documents into a MongoDB collection. Before you can find, update, and delete documents in MongoDB, you need to insert those documents. You can insert one document using the InsertOne() method, or insert multiple documents using either the InsertMany() or BulkWrite() method. The following sections focus on InsertOne() and InsertMany(). To learn how to use the BulkWrite() method, see the Bulk Operations guide. \nTHE _ID FIELD \nIn MongoDB, each document must contain a unique _id field. The two options for managing this field are:      * Managing this field yourself, ensuring that each value you use is unique.  * Letting the driver automatically generate unique ObjectId values. The driver generates unique ObjectId values for documents that you do not explicitly specify an _id. Unless you provide strong guarantees for uniqueness, MongoDB recommends you let the driver automatically generate _id values. \nNOTE Duplicate _id values violate unique index constraints, which causes the driver to return a WriteError. To learn more about the _id field, see the Server Manual Entry on Unique Indexes. To learn more about document structure and rules, see the Server Manual Entry on Documents. \nINSERT A DOCUMENT \nUse the InsertOne() method to insert a single document into a collection. Upon successful insertion, the method returns an InsertOneResult instance that contains the _id of the new document. \nEXAMPLE \nThis example uses the following Book struct as a model for documents in the books collection: type Book struct {\tTitle  string\tAuthor string}  The following example creates and inserts a document into the books collection using the InsertOne() method: coll := client.Database(\"db\").Collection(\"books\")doc := Book{Title: \"Atonement\", Author: \"Ian McEwan\"}\nresult, err := coll.InsertOne(context.TODO(), doc)\nfmt.Printf(\"Inserted document with _id: %v\\n\", result.InsertedID) \nVIEW OUTPUT \nMODIFY INSERTONE BEHAVIOR \nYou can modify the behavior of InsertOne() by constructing and passing an optional InsertOneOptions struct. The available options to set with InsertOneOptions are: Option\nDescription\nBypassDocumentValidation\nIf true, allows the write to opt-out of document level validation.\nDefault: false Construct an InsertOneOptions as follows: opts := options.InsertOne().SetBypassDocumentValidation(true)  \nINSERT MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS \nUse the InsertMany() method to insert multiple documents into a collection. Upon successful insertion, the InsertMany() method returns an InsertManyResult instance that contains the _id fields of the inserted documents. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example creates and inserts multiple documents into the books collection using the InsertMany() method: coll := client.Database(\"myDB\").Collection(\"favorite_books\")docs := []interface{}{    Book{Title: \"Cat's Cradle\", Author: \"Kurt Vonnegut Jr.\"},    Book{Title: \"In Memory of Memory\", Author: \"Maria Stepanova\"},    Book{Title: \"Pride and Prejudice\", Author: \"Jane Austen\"},}\nresult, err := coll.InsertMany(context.TODO(), docs)fmt.Printf(\"Documents inserted: %v\\n\", len(result.InsertedIDs))\nfor _, id := range result.InsertedIDs {    fmt.Printf(\"Inserted document with _id: %v\\n\", id)}  Your output should look like this: Documents inserted: 3Inserted document with _id: ObjectID(\"...\")Inserted document with _id: ObjectID(\"...\")Inserted document with _id: ObjectID(\"...\") \nMODIFY INSERTMANY BEHAVIOR \nYou can modify the behavior of InsertMany() by constructing and passing an optional InsertManyOptions struct.

Information\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to change documents in MongoDB using update and replace operations. Update operations change the fields that you specify while leaving other fields and values unchanged. Replace operations remove all existing fields except for _id in a document and substitute the deleted fields with the new fields and values you specify. In MongoDB, all methods to change documents follow the same pattern:  \nNOTE \nPLACEHOLDER changeX is a placeholder and not a real method. The pattern expects you to:      * Specify a query filter to match one or more documents to change.  * Specify the field and value changes.  * Specify options to modify behavior, if needed. The driver provides the following methods to change documents:  * UpdateByID()  * UpdateOne()  * UpdateMany()  * ReplaceOne()  * BulkWrite() (not discussed in this guide)  * FindOneAndUpdate() (not discussed in this guide)  * FindOneAndReplace() (not discussed in this guide) \nA NOTE ABOUT _ID \nEach document in a MongoDB collection has a unique and immutable _id field. You cannot use update and replace operations to change the _id field. If you attempt to change this field, the update and replace methods return a WriteError. \nUPDATE \nUse the UpdateOne() or UpdateByID() method to update a single document. Use the UpdateMany() method to update multiple documents. \nPARAMETERS \nEach method takes an update document that includes at least one update operator. The update operator specifies the type of update to perform. The update document also includes the fields and values that describe the change. Update documents use the following format: bson.D{{\"<update operator>\", bson.D{{\"<field>\", <value>},                                    {\"<field>\", <value>}, ... }},       {\"<update operator>\", ... }, ... }  See the MongoDB server manual for a complete list of update operators and descriptions. \nNOTE \nAGGREGATION PIPELINES IN UPDATE OPERATIONS If you are using MongoDB Server version 4.2 or later, you can use aggregation pipelines made up of a subset of aggregation stages in update operations. To learn more about the aggregation stages MongoDB supports in aggregation pipelines, see our tutorial on performing updates with aggregation pipelines. \nRETURN VALUES \nUpdateOne(), UpdateByID(), and UpdateMany() return an UpdateResult type that contains information about the update operation if the operation is successful. The UpdateResult type contains the following properties: Property\nDescription\nMatchedCount\nThe number of documents matched by the filter\nModifiedCount\nThe number of documents modified by the operation\nUpsertedCount\nThe number of documents upserted by the operation\nUpsertedID\nThe _id of the upserted document, or nil if there is none If multiple documents match the query filter passed to UpdateOne(), the method selects and updates the first matched document. If no documents match the query filter, the update operation makes no changes. EXAMPLE \nThe following document describes an employee: {   \"_id\" : 2158,   \"name\" : \"Mary Shelley\",   \"department\" : \"Marketing\",   \"role\" : \"Marketing Analyst\",   \"bonus\" : 2500,   ...} The following example uses the UpdateByID() method to:  * Match the document where the _id value is 2158.  * Set the name field to \"Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley\" and the role field to \"Marketing Director\".  * Increment the value of the bonus field by 2000. filter := bson.D{{\"_id\", 2158}}update := bson.D{{\"$set\", bson.D{{\"name\", \"Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley\"},   {\"role\", \"Marketing Director\"}}}, {\"$inc\", bson.D{{\"bonus\", 2000}}}}\nresult, err := collection.UpdateOne(context.TODO(), filter, update)fmt.Printf(\"Documents matched: %v\\n\",

\nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this guide use the following Plant struct as a model for documents in the plants collection: type Plant struct {\tSpecies string\tPlantID int32 `bson:\"plant_id\"`\tHeight  float64}  To run the examples in this guide, load the sample data into the db.plants collection with the following snippet: coll := client.Database(\"db\").Collection(\"plants\")docs := []interface{}{\tPlant{Species: \"Polyscias fruticosa\", PlantID: 1, Height: 27.6},\tPlant{Species: \"Polyscias fruticosa\", PlantID: 2, Height: 34.9},\tPlant{Species: \"Ledebouria socialis\", PlantID: 1, Height: 11.4},}\nresult, err := coll.InsertMany(context.TODO(), docs)  Each document contains a description of an individual plant that includes the species, plant ID, and height corresponding to the species, plant_id, and height fields in each document. \nTIP \nNON-EXISTENT DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS If the necessary database and collection don't exist when you perform a write operation, the server implicitly creates them. \nUPSERT \nApplications use insert and update operations to store and modify data. Sometimes, you need to choose between an insert and an update operation depending on whether the document exists. MongoDB simplifies this decision for us with an upsert option. An upsert performs one of the following actions:      * Updates documents that match your query filter  * Inserts a new document if there are no matches to your query filter You can specify an upsert by passing true to the SetUpsert() method in the options of the following write operation methods:  * UpdateOne()  * UpdateByID()  * UpdateMany()  * ReplaceOne()  * FindOneAndUpdate()  * FindOneAndReplace() \nTIP If you don't specify an upsert, no change occurs in the write operation when zero documents match your query filter. This is equivalent to passing false to the SetUpsert() method. \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example performs the following actions:  * Matches documents where the species is \"Ledebouria socialis\" and the plant_id is 3  * Updates the height of the matched document to 8.3  * Inserts this document if there are no matches to the query filter filter := bson.D{{\"species\", \"Ledebouria socialis\"}, {\"plant_id\", 3}}update := bson.D{{\"$set\", bson.D{{\"species\", \"Ledebouria socialis\"}, {\"plant_id\", 3}, {\"height\", 8.3}}}}opts := options.Update().SetUpsert(true)\nresult, err := coll.UpdateOne(context.TODO(), filter, update, opts)if err != nil {    panic(err)}\nfmt.Printf(\"Number of documents updated: %v\\n\", result.ModifiedCount)fmt.Printf(\"Number of documents upserted: %v\\n\", result.UpsertedCount) \nVIEW OUTPUT If you query the plants collection to view all documents, you can see that since the query filter did not match any documents, a new document was inserted with the specified fields: {\"species\":\"Polyscias fruticosa\",\"plant_id\":1,\"height\":27.6}{\"species\":\"Polyscias fruticosa\",\"plant_id\":2,\"height\":34.9}{\"species\":\"Ledebouria socialis\",\"plant_id\":1,\"height\":11.4}{\"species\":\"Ledebouria socialis\",\"plant_id\":3,\"height\":8.3} \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nTo learn more about the operations mentioned, see the following

* Execution Order\n * Ordered\n * Unordered\n * Additional Information\n * Related Operations\n * API Documentation \nOVERVIEW \nIn this guide, you can learn how to use bulk operations. Bulk operations perform a large number of write operations. Instead of making a call for each operation to the database, bulk operations perform multiple operations with one call to the database. \nSAMPLE DATA \nThe examples in this guide use the following Book struct as a model for documents in the books collection: type Book struct {\tTitle  string\tAuthor string\tLength int32}  To run the examples in this guide, load the sample data into the db.books collection with the following snippet: coll := client.Database(\"db\").Collection(\"books\")docs := []interface{}{\tBook{Title: \"My Brilliant Friend\", Author: \"Elena Ferrante\", Length: 331},\tBook{Title: \"Lucy\", Author: \"Jamaica Kincaid\", Length: 103},}\nresult, err := coll.InsertMany(context.TODO(), docs)  Each document contains a description of a book that includes the title, author, and page length corresponding to the title, author, and length fields in each document. \nTIP \nNON-EXISTENT DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS If the necessary database and collection don't exist when you perform a write operation, the server implicitly creates them. \nBULK WRITE \nTo perform a bulk operation, pass an array of WriteModel documents to the BulkWrite() method. \nMODIFY BEHAVIOR \nThe BulkWrite() method optionally takes a BulkWriteOptions type, which represents options you can use to modify its behavior. If you don't specify a BulkWriteOptions, the driver uses the default values for each option. The BulkWriteOptions type allows you to configure options with the following methods: Method\nDescription\nSetBypassDocumentValidation()\nWhether to allow the write to opt-out of document level validation.\nDefault: false\nSetOrdered()\nWhether to stop performing write operations after an error occurs.\nDefault: true \nRETURN VALUES \nThe BulkWrite() method returns a BulkWriteResult type, which contains information about the bulk operation if it's successful. The BulkWriteResult type contains the following properties: Property\nDescription\nInsertedCount\nThe number of documents inserted.\nMatchedCount\nThe number of documents matched by the query filter in update and replace operations.\nModifiedCount\nThe number of documents modified by update and replace operations.\nDeletedCount\nThe number of documents deleted.\nUpsertedCount\nThe number of documents upserted by update and replace operations.\nUpsertedIDs\nA map of an operation index to the _id of each upserted document. \nOPERATIONS \nA WriteModel represents an insert, replace, update, or delete operation. \nINSERT \nTo perform an insert operation, create an InsertOneModel specifying the document you want to insert. To insert multiple documents, create an InsertOneModel for each document you want to insert. The InsertOneModel allows you to specify its behavior with the following method: Method\nDescription\nSetDocument()\nThe document to insert. EXAMPLE \nThis following example creates two InsertOneModel instances to insert two documents: models := []mongo.WriteModel{\tmongo.NewInsertOneModel().SetDocument(Book{Title: \"Beloved\", Author: \"Toni Morrison\", Length: 324}),\tmongo.NewInsertOneModel().SetDocument(Book{Title: \"Outline\", Author: \"Rachel Cusk\", Length: 258}),}  \nREPLACE \nTo perform a replace operation, create a ReplaceOneModel specifying the document you want to replace and a replacement document. To replace multiple documents, create a ReplaceOneModel for each document you want to replace.

perform an update operation, create an UpdateOneModel specifying the document you want to update and an update document. To update multiple documents, use the UpdateManyModel. The UpdateOneModel and UpdateManyModel allow you to specify their behavior with the following methods: Method\nDescription\nSetArrayFilters()\nThe array elements the update applies to.\nSetCollation()\nThe type of language collation to use when sorting results.\nSetFilter()\nThe query filter specifying which document to update.\nSetHint()\nThe index to use to scan for documents.\nSetUpdate()\nThe modifications to apply on the matched documents.\nSetUpsert()\nWhether to insert a new document if the query filter doesn't match any documents. EXAMPLE \nThe following example creates an UpdateOneModel to decrement a document's length by 15 if the author is \"Elena Ferrante\": models := []mongo.WriteModel{\tmongo.NewUpdateOneModel().SetFilter(bson.D{{\"author\", \"Elena Ferrante\"}}).\t\tSetUpdate(bson.D{{\"$inc\", bson.D{{\"length\", -15}}}}),}  \nDELETE \nTo perform a delete operation, create a DeleteOneModel specifying the document you want to delete. To delete multiple documents, use the DeleteManyModel. The DeleteOneModel and DeleteManyModel allow you to specify their behavior with the following methods: Method\nDescription\nSetCollation()\nThe type of language collation to use when sorting results.\nSetFilter()\nThe query filter specifying which document to delete.\nSetHint()\nThe index to use to scan for documents. EXAMPLE \nThe following example creates a DeleteManyModel to delete documents where the length is greater than 300: models := []mongo.WriteModel{\tmongo.NewDeleteManyModel().SetFilter(bson.D{{\"length\", bson.D{{\"$gt\", 300}}}}),}  \nEXECUTION ORDER \nThe BulkWrite() method allows you to specify if you want to execute the bulk operations as ordered or unordered in its BulkWriteOptions. \nORDERED \nBy default, the BulkWrite() method executes bulk operations in order you added them and stops if an error occurs. \nTIP This is equivalent to specifying true in the SetOrdered() method: opts := options.BulkWrite().SetOrdered(true)  \nUNORDERED \nTo execute bulk write operations in any order and continue if an error occurs, specify false to the SetOrdered() method. The method reports the errors afterwards. EXAMPLE \nThe following example performs the following actions in any order:      * Inserts two documents.  * Replaces a document where the title is \"My Brilliant Friend\" with a new document.  *
